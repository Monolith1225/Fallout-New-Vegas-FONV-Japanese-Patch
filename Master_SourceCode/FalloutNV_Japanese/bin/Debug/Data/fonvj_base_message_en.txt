GID00032172	Crimes are divided into two categories: major and minor.
GID00032173	Minor crimes cause only the victim to become hostile to you:
GID00032174	* Theft: If the owner sees you steal something that she owns, she will try to take it back from you. If you try to escape, or persist in stealing from her, she will attack you (or run for help). If you fight back, you are now committing a major crime (Assault, see below).
GID00032175	* Trespass: If the owner sees you open a locked door, container, or computer, he will immediately attack you.
GID00032176	Major crimes cause the victim and the victim's friends to become hostile to you:
GID00032177	* Assault: Attacking someone without provocation, or fighting back when someone attacks you for a minor crime.
GID00032178	* Murder: If there are witnesses who care about the victim, they will become hostile to you.
GID00032179	If a fight starts that you did not intend, you can attempt to yield by holstering your weapon. This may or may not be successful depending on how the attacker feels about you.
GID00032183	You use the Med-X and dull the patients pain. Carefully, you use the tweezers to pick out pieces of shrapnel. Due to the extreme loss of blood, the patient goes into circulatory shock. You quickly use the Super Stimpak to stabilize the patient. The patient will make a complete recovery.

GID00032186	* Visit a doctor and pay for healing.
GID00032187	* Use a Stimpak.
GID00032188	* Eat food or drink water.
GID00032189	* Sleep in a bed.

GID00032263	Ammunition is used by almost all Guns and Energy Weapons but is sometimes used by other weapon types. Basic ammo types have no special effects, but ammo subtypes may increase damage, reduce an enemy's Damage Threshold, or even decrease a weapon's spread. Effects are listed on the ammo submenu when the ammo is highlighted. Most weapons can use any ammo subtype that starts with the same name as the base ammo. Common ammo subtypes include:
GID00032264	* Armor Piercing: Ignores a large portion of the enemy's Damage Threshold, does slightly more damage.
GID00032265	* Hollow Point: Does much more damage, but is easily blocked by armor.
GID00032266	* Over Charge: Used by Energy Weapons, increases damage but degrades the weapon more quickly.
GID00032267	* Slug: Used by shotguns, slugs replace buckshot with a single, large bullet that is more accurate.
GID00032268	To switch ammo subtypes, equip them on this menu. Outside of the Pip-Boy, press 2 to cycle through ammo subtypes for your currently equipped weapon.

GID00032303	The generator looks to be fine, but some kind of large vermin has chewed into the power cable. With the proper know-how and some scrap metal, you could repair the connection and improve its output bandwidth. Otherwise you'll need help.

GID00032336	In order to heal a crippled limb, you have three choices: sleep in a bed, find a doctor, or use a Stimpak to heal yourself. In Hardcore Mode, you may only heal crippled limbs by using Doctor's Bags or by visiting a doctor for medical care.
GID00032337	<p>
GID00032338	Stimpaks can be used for general healing (which will also slightly heal crippling damage), or they can be applied directly to a limb to heal crippling damage.
GID00032339	<p>

GID00032350	This generator would provide power to Quarry Junction, if it were functional. Whoever assembled it had no idea what they were doing - many parts are connected incorrectly or hooked up backwards. Someone with the proper knowledge could easily get the generator operational.

GID00032380	Let's do this!
GID00032381	A quick study of the body reveals that the thug is still alive, and merely pretending to be dead.
GID00032383	You quickly grab some ice to treat the burns. Unfortunately, the ice doesn't help but only compounds the problem. The patient screams and dies due to cardiac arrest induced from the sudden pain.

GID00032500	The bodies of the Wests have bite marks on the neck area that go to the bone. The lack of bloodstains on the sheets is strange, as any bite or wound of that depth should have caused massive bleeding. The bite marks on the neck appear to be from a human or humans with sharpened incisors or canines. The bodies seem to have a blackish powdery residue present not unlike that found in old trainyards.
GID00032506	Charon has died!

GID00032528	To zoom in on an enemy, simply select it and release &-sUActnVats;. You are now able to target the individual body parts of that enemy.
GID00032529	The percentage value next to a body part indicates the chance to hit that body part with each shot. The small bar next to the body part indicates its condition; when the condition of a body part is completely reduced, that body part is crippled, and the targeted enemy will suffer the obvious ill effects -- crippling the legs reduces movement speed and any lunging attacks; crippling the arms affects accuracy, etc.
GID00032530	When using a melee weapon or unarmed combat, you will need to be close to have a chance to hit. Both melee and grenades are "full body" attacks, and you cannot specify a specific body part. As you raise your Melee Weapons or Unarmed skill, you will gain the ability to perform special attacks with weapons using those skills.
GID00032531	Every attack on a body part uses up Action Points. Generally, the smaller a weapon, the fewer Action Points are required for every shot. Keep in mind that you're not limited to shooting at just one target -- at any time, you can switch available targets, and attack them as well, so long as you have remaining Action Points.
GID00032532	When you've used up all of your Action Points, and are ready to leave V.A.T.S., press [%].

GID00032627	You examine the blood stain, but you don't notice anything else about it. You should keep an eye out for anything out of the ordinary.

GID00032777	You may also be presented with responses preceded by a certain Attribute or Skill, like [Strength] or [Science]. These responses are only visible if you have the minimum required value in the Attribute or Skill.

GID00033050	[Tabitha] Threats all around us... converging... like a noose, tightening! Two-head-bear people astride battle cattles!
GID00033052	The Talking Tree has been killed.

GID00033056	Cass has died.
GID00033060	[Tabitha] Licking the gate. Wants out of the pen.
GID00033062	Some terminals are protected, and can't be accessed without a password. If your Science skill is high enough, you can attempt to hack the terminal.
GID00033063	Selecting the correct password will grant you access. If your guess is incorrect, you will be shown how many letters match the correct password, and in the correct location.
GID00033064	You have 4 tries to guess correctly. If you fail, the terminal will remain inaccessible until you own the password. You can exit hacking at any time and try again. However, exiting the terminal will force its security to reset, delaying your ability to start hacking again.
GID00033066	[Rhonda] Moe, the Centaur? Favorite Centaur Moe? What's he up to?
GID00033068	An item's condition affects how well the item works, as well as its value. Weapons of lower condition will do less damage, and jam more frequently. Armor of lower condition will offer less Damage Resistance.
GID00033069	You can repair items in your Pip-Boy by selecting Repair on the item. You can only do this if you have similar items to use for parts. Whatever item you choose to repair with will be scrapped completely.
GID00033070	The degree to which damaged items can be repaired is dependent on your Repair skill.
GID00033072	You can be exposed to radiation either directly from the environment, or by ingesting irradiated food or water. A small amount of radiation will not hurt you, but as your accumulated exposure goes up, you will begin to suffer ill effects, including death, eventually.
GID00033073	Radiation Poisoning Effects:
GID00033074	* 200 rads: -1 EN
GID00033075	* 400 rads: -2 EN, -1 AG
GID00033076	* 600 rads: -3 EN, -2 AG, -1 ST
GID00033077	* 800 rads: -3 EN, -2 AG, -2 ST
GID00033078	* 1000 rads: Death!
GID00033079	Radiation Poisoning does not wear off, but can be healed by a doctor, or by taking RadAway. You can also protect yourself ahead of time by taking Rad-X, which increases your Radiation Resistance.
GID00033080	Your accumulated radiation exposure is displayed in your Pip-Boy, in the Status section of the Stats tab.
GID00033082	[Tabitha] I see Moe...
GID00033084	There appears to be enough chemical components available to create a small quantity of chems - assuming one has the knowledge to do such a thing.

GID00033090	Weapons and apparel with low Condition suffer from decreased Damage and Damage Threshold, respectively. There are two primary ways to repair low Condition equipment: self-repair and repair vendors.
GID00033091	* Self-Repair: In your Pip-Boy, the Repair menu shows any equipment you currently have that can be used to repair the selected piece of equipment. Highlight the piece of equipment you would like to sacrifice to make the repair. The efficiency of your repair is affected by your character's Repair skill.
GID00033092	* Repair Vendors: Some characters in the world have the ability to repair equipment in exchange for caps. Though they require no special gear to perform the repair, they are limited by their own skill. Extremely talented repair vendors may be able to restore a weapon or piece of apparel to almost perfect condition, but it may be expensive.
GID00033093	Once a weapon is above 75% Condition or piece of apparel is above 50% Condition, it is functioning as well as it can. Repairs made above that Condition are simply maintaining the equipment to keep it at peak performance for a longer period of time.
GID00033095	[Rhonda] Wow! It must be so exciting to see and know all. What a powerful reminder of your ultimate authority and power for our listeners!
GID00033097	You have no Bobbleheads in your inventory.

GID00033109	Raul: Yes, they'd have a 1 in 739452466138 chance of guessing it. But we both know that will never happen.
GID00033111	[Tabitha] Uh... I see Neil...

GID00033243	Since you've left Freeside, your bodyguard has stopped following you.
GID00033245	[Raul] I going to obey supreme Tabitha, claro, whatever she say. Just I feel so bad I die before I fix her special robot.
GID00033247	[Rhonda] Ooooh, Raul. Supreme commander Tabitha says you die today. Any reaction.
GID00033249	[Tabitha] Today you die, Raul! I command it!
GID00033251	The rockets launch successfully!
GID00033253	[Raul] Uh, either one works.
GID00033255	[Rhonda] Also joining us from his locked cell is Raul Tejada, master mechanic who can be executed at any time! Hello, Raul. Or should that be "Hola?"
GID00033257	Blackjack is a game played with one more standard decks of playing cards. In Fallout: New Vegas, it is played between the Courier and a casino dealer. The goal is to play a hand of two or more cards up to, but not exceeding, a combined value of 21 points. The value of each hand is determined by adding together the values of each individual card. Cards 2-10 are worth their listed value. Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points. Aces are worth either 1 or 11 points, whichever is more advantageous. A hand that exceeds 21 in total value is considered a "bust" and immediately loses.
GID00033258	After the initial bet is made, the player and dealer are both dealt two cards. Based on the Courier's current hand, the player has different options:
GID00033259	* Hit - Add a new card to the Courier's hand. The player must accept the value of this card, though aces provide whatever value is most advantageous at any given time.
GID00033260	* Stay - Courier's hand is effectively "locked" and the dealer will deal cards into his or her own hand until his or her hand is at least 17. Note: at some casinos, dealers will continue to hit on a "soft" 17 that contains an ace. In either case, the dealer has no decision-making process and will always follow the listed rule.
GID00033261	* Double Down - The Courier's bet is doubled but the dealer will give the Courier's hand only a single additional card.
GID00033262	* Split - If the Courier's initial hand is a pair, the player may double his or her bet and split the pair into two separate hands that are played individually.
GID00033263	* Surrender - This option is only available immediately after the first cards are dealt. It offers the player the option to sacrifice half of his or her bet and immediately fold. It is typically only done when the player's hand is particularly bad and the dealer is showing a very strong hand (for example, an ace).
GID00033264	Once the dealer has completed dealing into his or her own hand following the player's choice to stay, the values of the Courier's hand and the dealer's hand are compared. Assuming neither party has busted (gone over 21), the higher value wins. In the case of a tie, the hand is considered a push. If the dealer has "blackjack" (an ace and a ten-value card), he or she automatically wins unless the Courier also has blackjack. In that case, the hand is considered a push.
GID00033265	Individual casinos use different numbers of card decks, pay out natural blackjack hands at different odds, and shuffle their decks with varying frequency. Pay close attention to these details to develop advanced playing strategies.
GID00033267	This 9mm submachine gun is broken but can possibly be restored to a fully functioning weapon.
GID00033268	[Repair of 25 or greater required.]
GID00033270	Leave it alone.
GID00033271	Repair the 9mm submachine gun.
GID00033272	[Tabitha] I still miss you, Rhonda. After all these years...
GID00033274	You quickly repair the damaged circuits.
GID00033276	[Rhonda] That was today's and every day's extra special guest, Best Friend Tabitha, supreme commander of Utobitha and Wearer of the True Eyes!
GID00033278	[Tabitha] I am in control here!
GID00033280	[Rhonda] You're listening to Radio Free Utobitha, bringing truth to Utobithians 24 hours a day! Welcome!
GID00033282	You notice that the freezer is a little smaller than all of the others. After closer inspection, you find that there is a secret compartment in the back. Unfortunately, it is locked and you are unable to pick it. There must be a key to open this lock.
GID00033283	(Perception [%] passed)
GID00033285	You need a grenade to rearm this trap.
GID00033287	You are still dressed as a member of the Great Khans.
GID00033289	It appears that some sort of pass phrase needs to be entered in order to open the nearby door.
GID00033291	Leave the panel alone.
GID00033292	"Dear old friends, remember Navarro."
GID00033293	Activating the detonator will set off the atomic bomb, and destroy the town of Megaton. Are you sure you want to proceed?
GID00033295	Detonate the atomic bomb.
GID00033296	Do not detonate the atomic bomb.
GID00033297	Reflector panels on this array are damaged. Salvaged parts could be used to repair the array. Would you like to repair the array? (Repair 65 or higher Required or Use Solar Array Parts)

GID00033310	RL3 has been destroyed!
GID00033312	Tabitha: Shut - up - Raul!
GID00033314	The note reads: "I'm taking most of the boys west to go check out this vault we heard about. Stay here and keep an eye on things until we get back, and keep a closer eye on the Fiends - those guys are crazier than Scrambler. If there's any trouble, radio ahead."
GID00033316	The observer is hidden in the spawning pod.
GID00033318	A model of our solar system (not actual size). Beautiful, isn't it? RobCo, with its subsidiary REPCONN, has often gazed into the night sky, seeing the rich pageant of stars and planets above us. Our goal? To send unmanned rockets to these other systems, seeing their beauty firsthand while mining ever deeper into each planet's surface for precious resources needed here at home. This is our promise to mankind, extending our reach into a future where the number of RobCo and REPCONN rockets match the stars in the sky.
GID00033319	This Exhibit Brought To You By Your Friends at RobCo
GID00033321	Some folks have asked - why not a Protectron with wheels? RobCo wasn't afraid to answer that question: The Protect-O-Bot is theanswer. While safety standards prevented this free-wheeling dynamo from entering mass market production despite RobCo's best intentions and teams of lawyers, we take consolation in letting you can see this extremely well-funded experiment as it was intended - a robot moving so fast it looks like it's standing still!
GID00033322	Exhibit Brought to You By Your Friends at RobCo
GID00033324	You already rigged Watson's helmet with C4. You decide to leave it alone so you don't attract unwanted attention to it.
GID00033327	Leave the generator alone.
GID00033328	Turn off generator.
GID00033329	Your Karma is too low to acquire this follower.
GID00033331	Your voice echoes somewhere below you. A moment later, the equipment around you loses power.
GID00033333	You never can have too many hands - three, why not four? That was RobCo's inspiration behind the popular (and cost-effective) Mr. Handy model, the first of the line shown here. Always a help around the household, whether with Mom in the kitchen using its titanium circular power saw or in the garage with Dad using its armor-piercing laser array, Mr. Handy is not just helpful... he's your friend, too.
GID00033334	Exhibit Brought to You By Your Friends at RobCo
GID00033336	RobCo's always had an eye for robotics, and this little fellow is no different! This robotic marvel can not only recognize your face and voice with advanced facial and auditory recognition technology, it can also broadcast video and audio as well! Think of it - all the sights and sounds of your radio and TV in your living room at home blasted directly at you on the street, subway, bathroom, or wherever you may be! Never fear, you'll never miss a news bulletin or presidential address again, no matter where you are!
GID00033337	Exhibit Brought to You By Your Friends at RobCo
GID00033339	Whoa, watch your step! You don't want to be facing this fearsome fellow if you accidentally stumble into a restricted area. Whether sporting the latest in dual miniguns, rockets, or laser cannons, the Sentrybot not only takes it job seriously, it also takes no prisoners! It's proof of RobCo's commitment to defense that these deadly guards are concealed in chambers throughout this facility, so let this be a warning: Watch where you step, or out'll come RobCo, guns blazing!
GID00033340	Exhibit Brought to You By Your Friends at RobCo
GID00033342	You restored the pump station's network connection.
GID00033344	Officially called the "Z43-521P" by silly engineers, we prefer to call this little scrapper by its true nickname, the "Green Bean." After all, which would you prefer in your backyard garden - a smoldering Z43-521P, or a green bean?* One sounds like it belongs if mentioned on the news, and make news it did... featuring REPCONN's plasma engine, it was soooo newsworthy that we decided to take the Quantum Matter Modulation unit out and see if we could use it for non-explosive uses.
GID00033345	* Rocket nickname chosen after results of first trial landing.
GID00033347	V29-321G may look like a big, fat, red rocket, Rocketeers, but Ol' Fatty here ran circles around the Earth not so long ago, so let's see you keep up! Sure, V29-321G's re-entry gave it its more commonly-known nickname "Big Fat Fiery Fred," but here at REPCONN we chose to focus on the successes and apply what we learned about explosive-resistant shielding to future models and even our landing platforms!*
GID00033348	* The newly-(re)constructed REPCONN Launch Facility was a direct beneficiary of this discovery.
GID00033350	"Arrive at peaceful resolutions by using superior firepower."
GID00033352	This sleek and purple R77-293A "Needlenose" is what happens when you mix fossil and plasma in a rocket and shake it up! The fossil fuels punch this sharp-nosed terror through the sky, and the plasma is used to shoot it through space to planets where REPCONN can mine more fossil fuels,* continuing the whole cycle again!
GID00033353	* Interplanetary mining and resource rights still in negotiation.
GID00033355	The first phase of Caravan game play involves each player drawing eight cards from his or her deck. From this hand, each player, in turn, lays down one numbered card or ace per "track" on the three caravans. A player's three caravans are competing for contracts with their opponent's caravans opposite them on the same track.
GID00033356	If a player has no numbered cards or aces in his or her hand, or if he or she is unhappy with any given card currently in hand, the player may discard and draw from his or her own deck. However, discarded cards are out of play for the current game and a smaller deck increases the player's odds that they will be forced to forfeit the game through exhaustion.
GID00033358	Just like the rocket you see here, we're aimed at the sky, but we've got a ceiling in the way! See, Rocketeers, while REPCONN is (was) focused on non-radioactive* propulsion engines, we still need to sneak back and use some of our older "proven" techniques with nuclear-driven engines to make space travel a reality. Partnered with our new buddy RobCo, we've dug up older, cheaper technology for upcoming orbital projects. No worries, even if you can't always see what we're up to up there - we can see you!
GID00033359	* Any implication of radioactive material as negative is unintentional and in no way reflects RobCo or its subsidiary REPCONN.
GID00033361	Force your parents a short drive south, and you'll see the retractable dome of REPCONN's launch facility (not actual size!). You may have heard wild stories about rocket flights and their impact* on nearby towns and communities, but REPCONN feels you can't put a price of space exploration - after all, Rocketeers, you do want to go into space someday... don't you?
GID00033362	* Statement is figurative and inadmissible as evidence in a court of law.
GID00033364	Arcade has returned to Freeside.
GID00033366	This person appears to be near death. To remove them from the cross would kill them.
GID00033368	Why, look here! A pile of itty-bity safety barrels,* all nestled together like a family sitting down to dinner! Now, while it's claimed even the safest nuclear waste disposal procedures seep poison into the environment that never, ever goes away, in REPCONN's case, we say it all depends on where you put them - and Nevada's just the place!
GID00033369	* Nomenclature for "hazardous waste barrels" as per REPCONN glossary specs.
GID00033371	Unique encounter [%]
GID00033373	We've all heard "stories" that radiation is dangerous - fact or fiction?* A common site in factories, military installations, and the basements of selected government-funded middle schools, these safety barrels* are just what the name implies - safe. While their attractive coloring can be interpreted as a warning, for REPCONN, it's an invitation to a future filled with nuclear power!
GID00033374	* Rhetorical questions and nomenclature of exhibit items cannot be used as a basis for criminal prosecution.
GID00033376	Administrative Security Robots Disabled
GID00033378	You have earned the Beautiful Beatdown perk.
GID00033380	Hold up, Rocketeers, what's this? This trio of cylinders isn't a trio of cylinders at all!* They're containers holding what some* scientists call "plasma." Can you say "plasma?" REPCONN's always looking to the future, and in our future, we don't have to worry about radiation, health risks, or lawsuits when using this new and improved fuel source to blast our rockets into and out of the sky!
GID00033381	* Clarification: "Cylinders" and "plasma" are factually correct designations of display items, both by definition and by the scientific community.
GID00033383	What's this? A dull rod? Not so, Rocketeers! This "dull rod" once powered REPCONN's old nuclear-propelled rockets and still contains harmless* traces of radioactive material. As an exercise, stare closely* at the rod and try to spot the telltale glow!
GID00033384	* While this case is lead-lined (standard in these cases, not specifically requested for this display), do not touch, look, or stand too close to this exhibit - keep your legs moving and see the rest of the museum!
GID00033386	iButtonVar is [%]

GID00033392	"Always be ready to take one for the team."
GID00033394	Caesar is in a coma and is near death. Only an operation to remove the tumor from his brain will save him.
GID00033395	You already have a set of Surgical Tools, but you will need a Doctor's Bag before you can perform the operation.
GID00033397	Leave Caesar alone.
GID00033398	You fixed the Prospector Saloon's radio.
GID00033401	You have equipped faction armor! Faction armor disguises you as a member of that faction. Members of that faction now consider you a friend, while enemies of that faction will attack you on sight regardless of your personal faction relation with them. Any reputation changes that occur while wearing faction armor still affect your character.
GID00033402	Security personnel such as guards and watchdogs will see through your disguise and alert anyone nearby, so watch out!
GID00033404	Karma is an overall indication of your sense of good, evil... or neutrality. Your Karma starts at Neutral, and changes based on your actions. It can go up to Good or Very Good, or down to Evil or Very Evil. Kind or self-sacrificing acts will net you good Karma. Selfish and malicious acts will earn evil Karma. Sometimes, killing a particularly saintly or terrible enemy will modify your Karma as well.
GID00033405	Though some people in the world react to Karma, most base their opinons off of Reputation. Karma is simply the universe's way of tracking your good and bad deeds in the world.
GID00033407	All the radio signals you have discovered are listed on the Radio screen in the Data tab of your Pip-Boy. Signals listed in bright text are within range, and can be listened to.

GID00033412	You pull out your blade and hack blindly at the leg. After a series of random and frenetic cuts you notice the leg is looking better. It looks like he'll be able to keep it after all.

GID00033450	Boone now has 1st Recon Assault Armor, designed to provide snipers with maximal protection while deployed on aggressive missions in hotly contested zones. It will not count against his carrying capacity.
GID00033452	You use your Repair skill to determine that someone has removed a vital component for the door's operation, but you manage to repair the door anyway.

GID00033472	You are hostile with the residents of Arefu.
GID00033474	With limited medical knowledge, you mistakenly administer a lethal dose of painkillers mixed with antibiotics. The patient lets out one last labored breath before succumbing to the overdose.
GID00033476	Examining the trajectories a little further, it looks like the computer is set to take a non-optimal route to the specified destination.
GID00033477	You surmise that with minor alterations, you can plot a course that will take them about 12.5%% closer to their intended destination.
GID00033478	Do you wish to alter the rockets' course?
GID00033480	Make the change.
GID00033481	Don't make the change.
GID00033482	The console is powered, and ready to accept the activation code.
GID00033484	Leave it alone.
GID00033485	Enter the code.
GID00033486	Caravan players begin the game by establishing a mutual bet. There is only one betting phase per game. Since Caravan has its roots in merchant caravans, players are allowed to use any common currency available, regardless of its origins. Though bottle caps are common, players may also offer NCR dollars or Legion coins. Once a bet is established, players move on to deck building.
GID00033488	You quickly install the device as directed. Immediately a small green light on it begins pulsing, indicating that it has begun transmitting.
GID00033490	"Because it's easier to have courage from a safe distance away."

GID00033507	You have gained the Lord Death perk.
GID00033509	The robot lies inert on the table, giving no indication of having worked recently, or ever. A nameplate on part of the surface is scratched and mostly faded, but you can still make out the faint word "Rhonda".

GID00033523	"Found a nice little spot to scout the prison from. Place has been pretty active recently. Those thrice-damned powder gangers have been spreading out, so I need to be careful to avoid them. It doesn't help that I have to get back early each night or risk getting blinded by the sand."

GID00033527	You carefully add Psycho to Pacer's Jet, guaranteeing an altogether different high the next time he uses it.

GID00033555	ED-E has gone to the Lucky 38.
GID00033558	You have established a reputation with a group of people in the wasteland! Whether that reputation is good or bad, you're finally somebody, and people associated with that group will start to react to what you've done. There are many different factions in the wasteland, and you can develop a distinct reputation with each one.
GID00033559	As you perform actions that benefit a group, you will gain Fame. If you peform actions that harm a group, you will gain Infamy. Your reputation with any given group is a measure of the combined total of Fame and Infamy that you have earned. The benefits and drawbacks of any given reputation depend on the group itself. You may receive discounts with merchants, provoke attacks from hired thugs, or simply be treated differently.
GID00033560	Though you will initially start out with a Neutral reputation with any given faction, your Fame and Infamy will eventually push your reputation in different directions. You can see all of your current reputations under the General section of your Pip-Boy.

GID00033640	You repair the generator.
GID00033642	Tabitha: Fine! You want the equipment here so badly!? Here, I'll let you have a piece!

Each reel randomly stops on or between one of many symbols on the reel. Depending on the combination of symbols that comes up, the player will either lose his or her bet or receive a payout based on the odds of the combination coming up.
GID00033764	Different slot machines have different numbers of symbols and correspondingly different payout odds. You can check the payout odds from within the game at any time.

GID00033792	Ammunition is used by almost all Guns and Energy Weapons but is sometimes used by other weapon types. Basic ammo types have no special effects, but ammo subtypes may increase damage, reduce an enemy's Damage Threshold, or even decrease spread. Effects are listed on the ammo submenu when the ammo is highlighted. Most weapons can use any ammo subtype that starts with the same name as the base ammo. Common ammo subtypes include:
GID00033793	* Armor Piercing: Ignores a large portion of the enemy's Damage Threshold, does slightly more damage.
GID00033794	* Hollow Point: Does much more damage, but is easily blocked by armor.
GID00033795	* Over Charge: Used by Energy Weapons, increases damage but degrades the weapon more quickly.
GID00033796	* Slug: Used by shotguns, slugs replace buckshot with a single, large bullet that is more accurate.
GID00033797	To switch ammo subtypes, equip them on this menu. Outside of the Pip-Boy, press [%] to cycle through ammo subtypes for your currently equipped weapon.
GID00033799	It sounds like the Omertas are mounting some sort of attack on the Strip. They are receiving heavy casualties from the Securitrons and other casinos.
GID00033801	The console is currently without power.
GID00033803	Invalid encounter -- keep rolling.
GID00033805	What the fuck is happening on the Strip? I'm getting reports that someone just bombed the embassy.
GID00033807	You repair the gun controls and set the AA gun to attack any nearby aircraft.
GID00033809	You have reactivated the power to the east side of the power plant.
GID00033811	The note reads: "Some of the fellas farther north are trying to organize. We're starting to think it's a good idea. Got to pool resources if we're gonna survive out here. Sure you've noticed the decline in travelers. If they're getting wise, so should we."
GID00033813	Those beasts drug the rest of the men away. Oh God, I hope they don't come back for me.
GID00033815	You have rearmed the trap!
GID00033817	The note reads: "Some of the fellas farther north are trying to organize. We're starting to think it's a good idea. Got to pool resources if we're gonna survive out here. Sure you've noticed the decline in travelers. If they're getting wise, so should we."
GID00033819	Guardian is down. I repeat Guardian is down. Requesting backup from any nearby forces.
GID00033821	The express elevator has no power. The elevator panel must be repaired before it can be used.
GID00033823	The note reads: "Not many patrols out here lately, which means not much loot. Our crew is thinking we should make a move soon. Follow the tracks up north; head towards the Strip. You in? Ain't on the chain gang anymore, but we still gotta stick together."
GID00033825	This is Private Halford requesting backup. Anyone out there?
GID00033827	Welcome to Hardcore Mode! There are three basic needs that Hardcore Mode requires you to monitor: dehydration (H2O), starvation (FOD), and sleep deprivation (SLP). Each of these needs must be monitored and kept in check or you will suffer penalties and, in extreme cases, death.
GID00033828	Your needs are continually ticking away and can be monitored on the Status screen of your Pip-Boy. When you start to suffer ill-effects from neglected needs, your HUD will display the corresponding code for that need. Be aware that waiting, sleeping, and Fast Travel will also affect your needs. If performing any of these activities would result in death, you will be prevented from doing so.
GID00033829	* Dehydration (H20) - Dehydration increases at a faster pace than starvation or sleep deprivation. It can be relieved by drinking water or eating certain types of food. Some drinks, such as alcohol and soda, can increase dehydration, so be careful!
GID00033830	* Starvation (FOD) - The onset of starvation is slower than dehydration, but quicker than sleep deprivation. It can be relieved by eating food.
GID00033831	* Sleep Deprivation (SLP) - Sleep deprivation is the most low-maintenance of the basic needs. Though a few chems and drinks can help offset sleep deprivation, nothing beats sleep itself.
GID00033833	Bravo, this is Camp Guardian calling for backup. No sign of the rest of the men stationed here.
GID00033835	The rockets crash. You're a jerk.

GID00033863	If the bunker's power regulators are destroyed, its reactor core will overload in a matter of seconds - with catastrophic results.
GID00033867	All weapons fall under a weapon skill category that determines how effective the weapon is: Guns, Energy Weapons, Explosives, Melee Weapons, or Unarmed. Compare the small icon below and to the left of the weapon's icon to the icon shown on the Pip-Boy's skill menu.
GID00033868	* DAM/DPS: These indicate the base Damage and Damage Per Second, respectively. Weapons with a low DAM have difficulty penetrating armor. If you hit a target's Damage Threshold, switch to a weapon with a higher DAM or use ammo that reduces the target's Damage Threshold (e.g. Armor Piercing).
GID00033869	* STR and Skill: Many weapons have a Strength and/or skill requirement. If your character does not meet the Strength or skill requirement for the weapon, its aim will wobble (if a firearm) or it will attack more slowly (if a hand-to-hand weapon).
GID00033870	* CND: A weapon's Condition affects the amount of damage is does. At 75% Condition or higher, a weapon does maximum damage and only needs to be maintained. A weapon with low Condition will do less damage and may jam when reloaded.
GID00033871	* Repair / Mod: These options take you to the Repair and Mod submenus, where you may repair damaged equipment or attach weapon modifications, respectively.
GID00033873	This pile of eggs must be how the forager ants sustain their numbers. With a little more insight, you may be able to figure out how to use these eggs to your advantage.

GID00034140	Give the boy a hug and tell him everything will be okay.
GID00034141	Confiscate the stolen property by force, and leave the boy there as punishment.

GID00034144	You examine the area and notice a bloody wrench and a toolbox nearby. Someone was killed here recently, and judging by the scene it was one of the engineers. You should keep an eye out for any engineers acting strangely.
GID00034146	You are now hostile with Reilly's Rangers.

GID00034158	You are approached by a frenzied vault scientist, who yells, "I'm going to put my quantum harmonizer in your photonic resonation chamber!" What's your response?
GID00034160	"But doctor, wouldn't that cause a parabolic destabilization of the fission singularity?"
GID00034161	"Yeah? Up yours too, buddy!"
GID00034162	Say nothing, but grab a nearby pipe and hit the scientist in the head to knock him out. For all you knew, he was planning on blowing up the vault.
GID00034163	Say nothing, but slip away before the scientist can continue his rant.

GID00034168	You lack the Explosives skill needed to interact with the bomb (Explosives [%] or higher required).
GID00034170	Primm Slim has died!
GID00034172	The Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System, or V.A.T.S., allows you to pause the game, assess any combat situation tactically, and target the specific body parts of any enemies onscreen.
GID00034173	Pressing and holding &-sUActnVats; will pause the game and scan the area of targets.
GID00034174	To zoom in on an enemy, simply select it and release &-sUActnVats;. You are now able to target the individual body parts of that enemy.
GID00034175	The percentage value next to a body part indicates the chance to hit that body part with each shot. The small bar next to the body part indicates its condition; when the condition of a body part is completely reduced, that body part is crippled, and the targeted enemy will suffer the obvious ill effects -- crippling the legs reduces movement speed and any lunging attacks; crippling the arms affects accuracy, etc.
GID00034176	When using a melee weapon or unarmed combat, you will need to be close to have a chance to hit. Both melee and grenades are "full body" attacks, and you cannot specify a specific body part. As you raise your Melee Weapons or Unarmed skill, you will gain the ability to perform special attacks with weapons using those skills.
GID00034177	Every attack on a body part uses up Action Points. Generally, the smaller a weapon, the fewer Action Points are required for every shot. Keep in mind that you're not limited to shooting at just one target -- at any time, you can switch available targets, and attack them as well, so long as you have remaining Action Points.
GID00034178	When you've used up all of your Action Points, and are ready to leave V.A.T.S., press [%].
GID00034180	You disarm and remove the grenade.

GID00034388	Welcome to Hardcore Mode! There are three basic needs that Hardcore Mode requires you to monitor: dehydration (H2O), starvation (FOD), and sleep deprivation (SLP). Each of these needs must be monitored and kept in check or you will suffer penalties and, in extreme cases, death.
GID00034389	Your needs are continually ticking away and can be monitored on the Status screen of your Pip-Boy. When you start to suffer ill-effects from neglected needs, your HUD will display the corresponding code for that need. Be aware that waiting, sleeping, and Fast Travel will also affect your needs. If performing any of these activities would result in death, you will be prevented from doing so.
GID00034390	* Dehydration (H20) - Dehydration increases at a faster pace than starvation or sleep deprivation. It can be relieved by drinking water or eating certain types of food. Some drinks, such as alcohol and soda, can increase dehydration, so be careful!
GID00034391	* Starvation (FOD) - The onset of starvation is slower than dehydration, but quicker than sleep deprivation. It can be relieved by eating food.
GID00034392	* Sleep Deprivation (SLP) - Sleep deprivation is the most low-maintenance of the basic needs. Though a few chems and drinks can help offset sleep deprivation, nothing beats sleep itself.

Never fired, and luckily untouched by the hail of bullets that ended its notorious owner's life, the weapon's mint condition inspires dread in all who look upon it. Experts speculate that Vance might have killed as many as fifty people had he ever fired the gun - so long as his aim was exact and he was starting off with a full clip - or even more if he had additional ammo clips and remembered to reload!

GID00034584	The Barter screen allows you to trade, buy or sell items. The types of items that can be traded, bought, or sold depend on the person you're trading with. The prices you get for buying or selling depend on your Barter skill.
GID00034585	To Barter, simply select an item and move it from your inventory into the other person's (if you want to sell or trade one of your own items) or from the other person's inventory into your own (if you want to buy or trade for one of their items).
GID00034586	As items are moved back and forth, caps will also be automatically moved between both parties. This is represented by the large "caps" arrow in the middle.
GID00034587	If the arrow is darkened, it means one of you doesn't have enough caps to complete the transaction. You cannot accept the barter if you don't have enough caps. But you can accept it if the other person doesn't have enough, but at this point, you are giving items away for free.

GID00034754	Sierra Petrovita has been killed.
GID00034756	Roulette is a game of chance in which a ball is spun on a spinning wheel marked with 38 colored and numbered pockets. As the ball loses momentum, it eventually drops into one of the pockets. Before the ball is spun, players place bets on individual numbers or groups of numbers, the colors red or black, or whether the number will be odd or even. If the ball lands in a pocket covered by one of the player's bets, he or she receives a reward proportional to the odds of his or her bet. Player bets fall into two categories: inside bets and outside bets.
GID00034757	Inside Bets - Inside bets are placed on the numbered sections of the board or on the outside edges.
GID00034758	* Straight-Up - A single number. The chip is entirely inside the square.
GID00034759	* Split - Two adjoining numbers. The chip is placed on the line between the numbers.
GID00034760	* Street - Three numbers in a horizontal line. The chip is placed at the edge of a line.
GID00034761	* Six Line - Two adjoining streets. The chip is placed at the edge between two streets.
GID00034762	* Corner - Four numbers in a square. The chip is placed at the intersection of the four numbers.
GID00034763	* Basket - 0, 1, and 2; 0, 00, and 2; or 00, 2, and 3. The chip is placed at the intersection between the three numbers.
GID00034764	* Top Line - 0, 00, 1, 2, and 3. The chip is placed at the corner of 0 and 1.
GID00034765	Outside Bets - Outside bets are played off of the main numbered section of the board and never include 0 or 00.
GID00034766	* 1-18, 19-36 - The first and second halves of the numbered board.
GID00034767	* Red, Black - Red and black numbers.
GID00034768	* Even, Odd - Even and odd numbers.
GID00034769	* 1st, 2nd, 3rd Dozen - The first (1-12), second (13-24) or third (25-36) set of numbers.
GID00034770	* 1st, 2nd, 3rd Column - A bet on an entire vertical column of numbers. The chip is placed at the base of the column.

GID00034863	People and creatures that you perceive are displayed on the compass as vertical bars. Red bars indicate enemies.
GID00034864	Out in the Wasteland, the compass also indicates nearby locations as small triangles.
GID00034866	The My First Laboratory is currently brewing a new compound which should take about a day. Detoxify is not available until it's completed.

GID00034908	Your luck has increased!
GID00034910	Your stealth state is displayed when you crouch (&-sUActnCrouch;). [HIDDEN] means nobody detects you. [CAUTION] means someone is searching for you. [DANGER] means you have been detected by an enemy.
GID00034911	How stealthy you are is affected by many factors:
GID00034912	* Sneak skill: Your Sneak skill only helps you when you are crouching. The higher your Sneak skill, the easier it is to remain undetected, steal an item, or pick someone's pocket.
GID00034913	* Line of sight: An enemy is much less likely to detect you if he can't see you.
GID00034914	* Light level: You are harder to see in darker areas.
GID00034915	* Movement: You are hardest to detect when motionless, easiest to detect when running.
GID00034916	* Apparel weight: Heavier apparel makes more noise when moving.
GID00034917	* Sound: Most melee weapons make very little noise; bigger guns make a lot of noise.
GID00034918	Attacking while undetected gives you an automatic "sneak" critical.
GID00034920	You are looking at the Presidential Vertibird. This is a perfect place to put a bomb to kill President Kimball. (Explosives 50 or higher Required)

GID00034975	Most game play in Caravan occurs during the Contract War. In this phase, both players are attempting to build their caravans and get them signed. To do this, their caravan must be neither light (below 21) or burdened (over 26). They must also compete with their opponent on the same track to prevent being outbid within the legal range.
GID00034976	On each of the three tracks, a caravan is considered signed if its value is from 21 to 26 and it is higher than the opponent's caravan on the same track. If two caravans are tied, neither is signed until the tie is broken. The game ends when all three tracks have signed contracts. Note: it is possible for a player to win while signing only two of the three contracts (the third going to the opponent). In such cases, all winnings still go to the overall victor.
GID00034977	Players have the following options on their turn:
GID00034978	* Play one card and draw a new card from his or her deck.
GID00034979	* Discard one card from his or her hand and draw a new card to replace it.
GID00034980	* Remove one of his or her own caravans from the table, discarding all cards in it.
GID00034981	Caravans are primarily built with numbered cards and aces, which can be placed in the player's caravans according to the following rules. Caravans with more than one card have a direction (ascending or descending) and a suit. Direction is determined by the last two cards in a caravan, suit by the last card in a caravan. All subsequent cards must continue in the same direction OR they must match suit. Cards of the same numerical value cannot be played in sequence, regardless of suit.
GID00034982	Face cards can be attached to numbered cards and aces in any player or opponent caravan. Face cards affect numbered cards and aces in various ways:
GID00034983	* Joker - Played against A, 2-10. Effects change based on whether it is an ace or numbered card (see below). Multiple jokers may be played on the same card.
GID00034984	* Ace - Value of 1. Jokers played on aces remove all other non-face cards of the ace's suit from the table. E.g. a joker played on an ace of spades removes all spades (except face cards and that card, specifically) from the table.
GID00034985	* 2-10 - Listed value. Jokers played on these cards remove all other cards of this value from the table. E.g. a joker played on a 4 of hearts removes all 4s (other than that card, specifically) from the table.
GID00034986	* Jack - Played against A, 2-10. Removes that card, along with any face cards attached to it.
GID00034987	* Queen - Played against A, 2-10. Reverses the current direction of the hand, changes the current suit of the hand. Multiple queens may be played on the same card.
GID00034988	* King - Played against A, 2-10. Multplies the value of the card upon which it is played. Multiple kings on the same card will have a multiplicative effect. E.g. one king on a 3 = 6. Two kings on a 3 = 12.
