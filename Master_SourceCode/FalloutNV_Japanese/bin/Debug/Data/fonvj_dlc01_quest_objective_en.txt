GID00081938	Get to the Gala Event control panel at the top of the belltower in Salida del Sol North and activate it.
GID00081939	Get to the Sierra Madre Main Gate and enter the casino.
GID00081940	Thread Vera's music sequence together at the Receptionist Terminal in the Lobby.
GID00081941	Escape the Sierra Madre Vault before your collar explodes.
GID00081942	Discover the secrets of the Sierra Madre at the Vault's central chamber.
GID00081943	Gain access to the Sierra Madre Vault.
GID00081944	Defeat Elijah.
GID00081945	(Optional) Sneak out of the Vault's chamber area undetected, trapping Elijah when he opens the vault.
GID00081946	Track down the source of the Sierra Madre invitation.
GID00081947	Wake up.
GID00081948	On your feet, before I set off your collar.
GID00081949	Look at your Pip-Boy. Listen to the audio log, follow the instructions.
GID00081950	From now on, do as I say. It's the only way you'll leave the Sierra Madre alive.
GID00081951	Try and run, disobey me? I'll set off your collar and find someone who knows how to listen.
GID00081952	...and no sleeping, no waiting around, not even for an hour. Waste my time, you're useless to me.
GID00081953	Picking up signals near your location. Detonators. Watch for traps.
GID00081954	Villa's comm speakers have... aged poorly, like the Madre. Pre-War junk.
GID00081955	The speakers emit a signal that'll set off your collar. Too close, too long, you'll lose your head.
GID00081956	Some speakers may be damaged, blue ones, sparking - you can destroy those. Others, red, too well-shielded.
GID00081957	Don't be stupid. Pay attention, keep moving. Hear your collar beep, look around.
GID00081958	Don't go through the gate to Puesta del Sol yet, gather the others first.
GID00081959	Leave the Salida gate alone. You're not done with the Villa yet, so don't stray.
GID00081960	You sure have filled your Pip-Boy's archives with garbage.
GID00081961	Mitchell... that your name, Mitchell? No, wait... previous owner, Vault 21. Vegas.
GID00081962	No matter, not important. Probably stole this Pip-Boy from him, didn't you.
GID00081963	Don't worry, if you're a thief, a thief is just what I need.
GID00081964	Followed the Gala radio signal, just like I did, hoping to strike it rich?
GID00081965	Cooperate with me, follow along, we'll crack the Sierra Madre. Together.
GID00081966	There were others like you... turned on each other, even before the collars.
GID00081967	Play your cards right, be smart, you'll live through this. Be dumb...
GID00081968	..well, your head wasn't much use anyway, was it?
GID00081969	The Villa's toxic. The more you're outside, the more you breathe...
GID00081970	...then the Cloud wins. So move fast, don't stay outdoors too long.
GID00081971	Outside, you may notice your vision'll pulse, get dizzy.
GID00081972	It's the Cloud. Eats your insides, slowly. Too much exposure, death.
GID00081973	Damn speakers at end of hall - red light means they're shielded. Must be a way to shut them off somewhere else.
GID00081974	Collar 12's near you, in the building.
GID00081975	Getting an odd signal near your location. Some kind of emitter, hunt for it.
GID00081976	Lost the emitter signal. Your work, I presume?
GID00081977	Picked up another emitter signal, then lost it.
GID00081978	Maybe you think I wanted to send people here. To inhale toxins. Die. Kill each other.
GID00081979	Hardly. If robots could do this, I'd have sent them in.
GID00081980	That collar around your neck is because people are unreliable. Even chains of command - unreliable.
GID00081981	These collars, with adjustments, work much better.
GID00081982	Watch out for the Villa inhabitants.
GID00081983	The Villa's inhabitants seem obsessed with Holograms. Use it to distract them.
GID00081984	Picking up an emitter signature - watch for Security Holograms, dangerous.
GID00081985	Main power's down. How troublesome.
GID00081986	The ventilation system controls should be located in that building.
GID00081987	They should help with the Cloud.
GID00081988	Good, ventilation's back online.
GID00081989	Deciding to explore? Curiosity kills, get back to the main path.
GID00081990	I mean it - if you die here, then this starts all over again.
GID00081991	Collars weren't always linked to each other. A mistake.
GID00081992	Others who came, kept killing each other. Now, I've fixed that by linking them to each other.
GID00081993	Keep heading West, that's where you'll need to leave the mutant.
GID00081994	Damn power station levers need his strength to operate.
GID00081995	You're at one of the Gala locations, you'll need to bring the mutant here.
GID00081996	Only he has the strength to operate the levers, I've found.
GID00081997	Head north, get to the bell tower. There is where you'll trigger the event.
GID00081998	Provided you have everyone in place.
GID00081999	Toxins are thick in your area. Move East, avoid the clouds.
GID00082000	Don't test me or the Cloud... both will kill you without a second thought.
GID00082001	Covering a lot of ground, good. Still a ways to go.
GID00082002	Stay focused. Only one chance to do this.
GID00082003	Salida del Sol... now a maze of toxins.
GID00082004	Entire Villa is a deathtrap.
GID00082005	Keep north - that's where you'll find the bell tower.
GID00082006	Everyone needs to be in place, or it'll be a wasted trip.
GID00082007	You're resourceful. Had a daughter, foster daughter, like you.
GID00082008	She was willful, stubborn. But clever. She's gone now. Lost to me.
GID00082009	We don't have time for you to explore the Villa, stick to the Gala.
GID00082010	Are you paying attention? Roam the Villa, and you'll die.
GID00082011	The bell tower. That's where you'll trigger the Gala Event.
GID00082012	It's a ways up. I'm sure you'll find a way to climb up there.
GID00082013	Take the ladder. It should still be intact.
GID00082014	Once you're in the tower, throw the switch, then get ready to move.
GID00082015	What are you doing?
GID00082016	The others aren't in place yet. Get them to their stations, then return here.
GID00082017	Leave the mute at the Switching Station - she'll know what to do.
GID00082018	Your detours are getting tiresome.
GID00082019	What do you expect to find? A way to escape? No, I don't think so.
GID00082020	This must have been paradise before the war.
GID00082021	But no, radiation and the Cloud ruined that dream.
GID00082022	Head west, past the toxins, get to the Switching Station.
GID00082023	So that's what happened to that one.
GID00082024	Pray you don't end up like him. Greed killed him. Can kill you, too.
GID00082025	Remember - you need to bring the mute girl here.
GID00082026	If not, it's a long walk back, and time's running out.
GID00082027	Sick of having to herd all of you through the Villa...
GID00082028	...at least you're making more progress than the last team.
GID00082029	Don't waste time trying to catch a glimpse of the Sierra Madre.
GID00082030	Enough detours, get back to the task at hand.
GID00082031	The Gala target is straight ahead - southeast on the compass.
GID00082032	It's where you should leave the Ghoul.
GID00082033	You're at the Gala area... now, you need someone to stay there.
GID00082034	Bring the Ghoul... he'll do.
GID00082035	I can hear the event firing off. Now get to the main doors, quickly.
GID00082036	Keep moving. The doors will close unless you get there in time.
GID00082037	Faster!
GID00082038	What's taking you so long? Get to the casino!
GID00082039	Get there soon or the doors will seal, and you'll be trapped outside.
GID00082040	If you're trying to crawl-and-hide, don't turn on your Pip-Boy light...
GID00082041	...that light? Makes it easier for... others to spot you.
GID00082042	See if you can access that terminal.
GID00082043	Might be some "Vending Machine" access codes you can download.
GID00082044	Those "Vending" Machines, the ones with the blue lights. Use them to resupply.
GID00082045	Gather any casino chips you see, take them to the machines.
GID00082046	Followed the signal here because of that damn voice.
GID00082047	Promising to "begin again?" Pre-War nonsense. More like "end again."
GID00082048	That's the way out - after you break into the Sierra Madre's vault. Try to leave, I'll set off your collar.
GID00082049	Follow my orders, freedom is yours. I promise.
GID00082050	The gate to the Sierra Madre's sealed, locked. For now.
GID00082051	Do as I say, and it won't be locked for much longer.
GID00082052	Those "vending" machines... vending wasn't their intended use.
GID00082053	They do so much more. Make the Villa self-sufficient.
GID00082054	< Elijah says the player disobeyed his warning about cooperating with companions, so player goes boom >
GID00082055	Now, piece together the words from her holotapes in the right sequence.
GID00082056	The elevator to the casino vault is locked, find a way to open it.
GID00082057	You found a way to the Vault... good. Now find a way into the Chamber.
GID00082058	Find the mute and deal with her. She's somewhere on this floor.
GID00082059	If that Ghoul's still alive... correct that. Or break him.
GID00082060	Hurry up and deal with the FEV reject, he's of no use to us.
GID00082061	Sierra Madre's still sealed up. Find a way to restore the power.
GID00082062	Trapped now. You won't be able to deal with the turrets alone.
GID00082063	That does it. I'm coming for you.
GID00082064	Your collar's set to detonate. You won't get far.
GID00082065	Door's sealed. Must be a key to the backstage. Hunt for it.
GID00082066	He knew a way to get to the starlet's room? Backstage "pass," indeed.
GID00082067	That starlet - Vera - must have had access the security? Maybe the audience controls...?
GID00082068	That Holotape needs a holo-emitter. Get to the projection booth, play it, and de-activate the Security Holograms.
GID00082069	Now, deal with the Ghoul. This has gone on long enough.
GID00082070	Now - find the voice fragment and escape before your collar explodes. Move!
GID00082071	Talk all you want, I don't trust him. At least you can leave now.
GID00082072	Get to the door before the collar explodes, move!
GID00082073	The Ghoul's your burden - find the Holotape fragment, and keep it to yourself.
GID00082074	Until you deal with the Holograms, you can't reach the Ghoul - find a way to de-activate the Security Holograms.
GID00082075	Doors'll sealed until power's back.
GID00082076	The door won't open until you restore power. Check the main casino.
GID00082077	Power first, then the door unlocks. Understand?
GID00082078	Must be a back entrance to the kitchen - check the main casino side corridors. Find it.
GID00082079	Shut off the gas valves, or that idiot'll kill us all.
GID00082080	Good, now keep moving. You still need to unlock the elevator to the vault.
GID00082081	Put him down, good. Now get out, before your collar blows.
GID00082082	Fix the valves and get out of there before his collar blows!
GID00082083	Good, now keep moving. Take the elevator to the vault.
GID00082084	Sounds like she's going to be difficult. Handle it.
GID00082085	Floor's buzzing with emitter signatures. Watch out for Holograms.
GID00082086	Find a way past the Hologram Security and get to the power switch.
GID00082087	Lot of power lines... leading to a room near the cashier's counter. Check it out.
GID00082088	The vault has an audio lock. And it responds to the starlet's voice. We need to find more samples.
GID00082089	A theater... it may have the recordings of the Starlet's voice we need.
GID00082090	Gas leak has stopped - now, for the mutant.
GID00082091	He broke one of the valves. Wait for him to leave, then fix it.
GID00082092	The door to the vault is voice-activated. Which means we need the starlet's voice. Or recordings of it.
GID00082093	The holotape... the starlet's voice is the key to the vault, look for more fragments.
GID00082094	What is wrong? Maybe... maybe you need to splice the fragment to make the phrase.
GID00082095	The Theater should have the tools you need to edit the tapes. Look around.
GID00082096	Ah, that's it. Try it out in the Suites at once.
GID00082097	That's it for the mutant reject. Now for the others.
GID00082098	Search for more recordings of the starlet. Maybe she had an admirer here, among the staff.
GID00082099	Look for more voice recordings. Might be something in her possessions.
GID00082100	That idiot's opened the gas valves! A single spark - or he sets off his collar, the casino's going to burn. Us along with him.
GID00082101	The gas leak's sealed the main kitchen door. Check for an emergency entrance - the casino side corridors, look there.
GID00082102	Don't let him spot you! If he does, talk him down before he has a chance to ignite the gas.
GID00082103	Quick! Talk him down before he ignites the gas!
GID00082104	Find Dog at the Police Station in the Villa.

GID00082137	Let Dean know it's safe for him to get to his Gala position.
GID00082138	Return to the Puesta del Sol South rooftop with Dean.
