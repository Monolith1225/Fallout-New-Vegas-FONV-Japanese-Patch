GID00088842	Yup, here you go.
GID00088843	Sorry, no more today. Try me again tomorrow.
GID00088844	I love it when you talk like that. Let me just get that interface up and running for you.
GID00088845	Fantastic, Citizen! Just input your quantity of seditious material on my interface, and in no time at all I'll have you a beautiful, clean book!
GID00088846	Won't that keep you happy and docile, Citizen?
GID00088847	As much as I'd love to, I'm afraid not. The data from that study has gone missing. You'll have to find a backup if you want to use the Smart Lights.
GID00088848	I certainly can!
GID00088849	Unlike certain other lightswitches, I'm competent. I'd just love to turn those lights on for you.
GID00088850	Oh... well, that's very sweet of you. Maybe one of these nights we can... discuss theorems?
GID00088851	Oh... well, that's very sweet of you. Maybe one of these nights we can... discuss theorems?
GID00088852	Oh... I'd love to, sweetie, but I don't have the programming. All the data from the experiments was lost.
GID00088853	You'd have to go out into that nasty old crater and find the backup copy.
GID00088854	You bet I can!
GID00088855	You bet I can! I bet that's more than that other tramp can do, huh?
GID00088856	Oh, you! I bet you say that to all the light switches!
GID00088857	Oh, you! I bet you say that to all the light switches!
GID00088858	Well, well... what have we got here? Another innocent little toaster. Come here, I won't hurt you... hah! Gotcha!
GID00088859	Oh, yes, the sweet smell of spilled electric guts, the sparking diodes - I fucking live for this!
GID00088860	I RECOMMEND WATCHING YOUR TONE WITH ME, LOBOTOMITE.
GID00088861	NOW... "YOUR" BRAIN. HAND IT OVER. OR WE'LL EXTRACT IT AGAIN.
GID00088862	WHAT? YOU DID? YOUR SURVIVAL, LET ALONE SUCCESS, BARELY REGISTERED ON MY PROJECTIONS.
GID00088863	NOW, ALL I NEED TO DO IS CHECK MY TRANSMISSION DATABANK, MOBIUS IS ALWAYS FILLING IT UP WITH HIS PSYCHOTIC CALLS...
GID00088864	OH YES, THERE'S THE SCHEMATICS, JUST LIKE YOU SAID. HOW TRUTHFUL.
GID00088865	Oh. Well... that's good. Were we supposed to fight? I certainly don't feel violent, but... well, these contraptions make it hard to tell.
GID00088866	Oh... did I leave that on? I thought I'd powered it down - was wondering what was causing the power outages.
GID00088867	Ah, lovely, figured that out, have we? Would you like a cookie?
GID00088868	Ew! Crawl back in there? Are you mad? I don't know where you've been!
GID00088869	For all I know, you're riddled with disease, or packing one of those delightful head wounds you seem to attract!
GID00088870	I'm not crawling back into your head just to ooze right back out again!
GID00088871	Well... I suppose you've convinced me well enough. I'll rejoin your body if that's your final decision.
GID00088872	Unfortunately, before we get to that stage of the proceedings, we have a problem.
GID00088873	Even if I could settle myself back in your skull and reconnect all those pesky nerve endings, Dr. Mobius doesn't have the tools here.
GID00088874	We would have to make use of Dr. Klein's lab, and I rather doubt the brains are inclined to share.
GID00088875	Very well, I suppose I have no choice. Goodbye peaceful, soothing brain jar, hello head wounds and scorpions.
GID00088876	Right! Look out, Think Tank! This brain is coming out of its jar!
GID00088877	I'm not going to lie to you, the prospect is definitely not that appealing.
GID00088878	Look at it from my perspective. Here, I have peace, quiet, and safety - well, barring the odd rogue scorpion.
GID00088879	In your head, I've got poison, radiation, grisly injuries, and biological functions.
GID00088880	Do you know how much more you can get done when you're not constantly looking for places to urinate? It's quite a lot, I can tell you.
GID00088881	Oh, sweet, sweet fulfillment! I'll break these down for you just as fast as I can!
GID00088882	Of course you don't. Why would you? You're not an insane robot obsessed with coffee cups. To you they're just worthless junk.
GID00088883	Doctor Mobius and I were deeply involved in research on the ability of light levels to enhance human cognition.
GID00088884	I was Doctor Mobius'... personal assistant! We were studying... um... oh, shoot, what was it?
GID00088885	Oh yeah! Lightning! No, no, wait, uh... Lighting. That's right. How lighting affects human interaction.
GID00088886	That arrangement suits me fine. Do try not to get too many holes drilled in your head, will you? I may want to drop by for sentimental reasons.
GID00088887	Oh, no, you don't need this hassle. You're too busy treating your body like a canvas of sucking flesh wounds to deal with your brain!
GID00088888	Ugh... It's not that I didn't like being in your head, you understand. As far as heads go, it was a rather nice one.
GID00088889	Well, then. I suppose this is goodbye for now. What will you do?
GID00088890	Oh... her. Trust me sweetie, you're better off not thinking about that frigid little ice queen.

GID00088908	Naw, baby, I'm all about biology. I'm the original, certified, rarefied, testified GS-2000 Biological Research Station. I'm a seed-clonin' machine.

GID00088910	If I recall... I had a plan that was working, eh, whatever it was. I don't think it reached fruition. I would recall fruit if it had happened.
GID00088911	I wasn't trying to kill them, just keep them out of trouble. What was that plan?
GID00088912	Blast! I probably... uh... wrote it down on the... floor somewhere.
GID00088913	Do you? You seem fine without it.
GID00088914	And does it even want to go back with you? Maybe you should ask it. It's quite independent, has all manner of opinions.
GID00088915	Tell you what - I'll leave it up to your brain. If it wants to go, then fine. If not... well, you should respect its wishes.
GID00088916	Whatever for?
GID00088917	Why, of course you can. I am well-versed in the Science of sharing. Well, when not chemmed out of my sphere.
GID00088918	Another? Why, of course. Happy to contribute to Science through chemistry.
GID00088919	Come back within the sequential span of twenty-five hours minus one, I'll have more... or is it two or three more spans? Time, you elusive creature.
GID00088920	[SUCCEEDED] The ghosts aren't real? That changes everything. Why, I can save my computing power for other perceptual unpossibilities.

GID00088950	My advanced degree in Curiosity says let the Lobotomite ask, Dr. Klein. The topics might be... most curious, indeed.
GID00088951	[SUCCEEDED] WHAT... WHAT IS IT DOING? DID WE INSTITUTE ELECTROSHOCK? OR IS IT EXCRETING?
GID00088952	[FAILED] CLEARLY THERE WAS ELECTROSHOCK. JUST LOOK AT IT, ITS FACIAL TISSUES SAGGING ALL OVER THE PLACE.
GID00088953	-The RADAR FENCE protects us all! If evidence is correct, the one who built it - is ME!-
GID00088954	-It keeps anything with a disembodied brain INSIDE - like US - and anything without a brain... also INSIDE!-
GID00088955	-It is the ULTIMATE DEFENSE against Communist aggression. There'll be no infectious ideas on MY watch!-
GID00088956	-There is LOGIC and purpose in it. If these technologies are needed to pierce the FORBIDDEN ZONE... so be IT.-
GID00088957	-Science! is powerful, and in the right hands... OUR hands... if we had hands, we would be nigh-unstoppable!-
GID00088958	Well, it's simple. Despite their many failings, they are rather bright. They are the "Think Tank" for a raisin. That, I didn't change.
GID00088959	Without something to distract them, make them afraid, they would simply de-deuce what had happened. And when they start deucing it up...
GID00088960	Then you came along, the final variable solved. They saw that their world was larger than they perceived. Bacteria, finally able to see its host.
GID00088961	Did I? Maybe I did. Can't have them leaving. Some reason for it. Ethics - or con-science?
GID00088962	You and your Brain are quite alike, I'm sure it knows the raisins better than I do.
GID00088963	-That castrated nickname of our facility is NOT its true name. The true name is: BIG MT. Where are your manners?-
GID00088964	-It is our HOME. THREATENED by the horrors of Mobius.-
GID00088965	-All we wish to do is continue our research, layer upon layer, above and beneath the floor of the Crater until we have our answers.-
GID00088966	-But NO! Mobius will not let us rest. Scaring us with his scary robots with their laser tails and blowing up all the time.-
GID00088967	Why, my little bear of teddyness, I am Doctor Dala, first head chief researcher of mineralogy and medicinal sciences.
GID00088968	I have 211 doctorates in both applied sciences and techniques to apply those sciences. I also possess a degree in Curiosity and Advanced Curiosity.
GID00088969	That is merely schooling, however. When possible, I prefer field work and observation to holotape eidetics. It has proven useful, especially now.
GID00088970	I have become the expert on humanology and Lobotomite behavior here at Big MT. My research doesn't descend into formography, it is only Science.
GID00088971	Oh, a variety of raisins... you're something of a homily. Er, anomaly? You're really quiet special, and not in the cranially-challenged way.
GID00088972	You see, you are the most successful brain extraction experiment ever performed here at Big MT. A victim of your own success, as it were.
GID00088973	If you were to go back with what your brain knows about the procedure, well...
GID00088974	...your brain could be popped back in and you could walk right out of here. Can't have brains moving around of their own volition.
GID00088975	Oh, removing it is a simple procedure. Well, except the complications it can cause to the heart and spine.
GID00088976	But once the heart and spine are gone... no trouble at all. Clamp the subject down, one laser incision around the skull, crack, snip, done.
GID00088977	The brain is finally free of the skinvelope, which is then kept automated for clean up duties around Big MT. Lobotomites.
GID00088978	With you, however, something is definitely wrong. We've never had a Lobotomite who kept speaking after being forcibly lobotomized.
GID00088979	I am relieved the pacification field is working. If it didn't, I would broadcast some concern to my colleagues about safety protocols.
GID00088980	Oh, curiosity. I experience that less now that I know everything. Or maybe it was when I found out some unpleasant answers? Mmm-hmm.
GID00088981	I find things curious as well. Go on.
GID00088982	Yes, yes, this is getting interesting. You are just filled with these little slices of curiosity, aren't you?
GID00088983	HMM? OH YES, THE LAST VISITOR... WELL, THE ONE JUST BEFORE YOU. HAD AN INTERESTING NAME FROM SOME LANGUAGE THAT'S ALMOST UNPOSSIBLE TO SPEAK.
GID00088984	WHAT DID WE SPEAK ABOUT...? MELANCHOLY FELLOW, HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT... HISTORY? BUT...
GID00088985	OUR CONVERSATION GOT INTERRUPTED... TWICE, I BELIEVE? ONCE WHEN THE TRAINS GOT DERAILED, AND THEN A SECOND TIME...
GID00088986	...ODDLY ENOUGH, NOW THAT I'M ACCESSING MY DATABANKS, I DON'T RECALL WHAT THE SECOND TIME WAS. MOBIUS' INCESSANT TRANSMISSIONS KEEP DISTRACTING ME.
GID00088987	ALSO, WE DIDN'T BRAIN-SCRUB THE VISITOR. HE MAY HAVE LEFT WITH SOME KNOWLEDGE HE SHOULDN'T'VE. I BELIEVE. MAYBE.
GID00088988	OH WELL, I'M SURE IT'S OF NO CONSEQUENCE. I DON'T MAKE MANY MISTAKES IN CALCULATION OR PERCEPTION, SO PROBABILITY FAVORS ME.
GID00088989	[SUCCEEDED] WHY, YES. WE ARE FILLED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE YOU SPEAK OF.
GID00088990	IF YOU WISH TO KNOW MORE, SIMPLY ASK THE OTHERS, THEY CAN HELP YOU.

GID00089005	I KNOW HOW THESE TECHNOLOGIES WORK. OF COURSE I KNOW.
GID00089006	IF YOU REMEMBER, WE DESCRIBED THEM IN CLEARLY ABSTRACT CONTRADICTORY STATEMENTS BEFORE. WHY WOULD WE DO THAT IF WE WEREN'T CERTAIN ON...
GID00089007	...ON HOW TO USE THEM, YES. SO LET ME... HMM, A BIT, I... I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

GID00089014	[FAILED] YES, YES, THE ANTENNA CAN DO DAMAGE...
GID00089015	...AND IT DID DO DAMAGE, ONCE YOU REMOVED IT FROM X-2. WAS THAT MY PLAN? IT MUST HAVE BEEN.
GID00089016	[SUCCEEDED] YES, THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE I SAID.
GID00089017	[FAILED] PLEASE LET ME THINK. THIS MAKES MY BRAIN HURT.

GID00089019	I'M THINKING. THIS IS ALL VERY COMPLICATED.
GID00089020	YES. WAIT. YOU DID, DIDN'T YOU?
GID00089021	YOU ARE LYING. NO, YOU ARE NOT. YOUR HEARTBEAT, PERSPIRATION... ALL EXCESSIVELY CONFIDENT AND SURE OF YOURSELF.
GID00089022	WHY WOULD YOU REASON WITH THAT MANIAC? HE'LL DESTROY US ALL!
GID00089023	YES, YOU CAN. YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE THAT I CAN SEE.
GID00089024	I'M NOT GOING TO HARM IT, I'M GOING TO DISSECT IT UNTIL ITS DEAD. WHY THE SUDDEN INTERSECTION, DALA.
GID00089025	Um... it's personal. But... I would hate if its dying screams revealed any odious personal habits I... or any of us might have.
GID00089026	I cannot stand a breathing, a sweet breathing organism, breathing in, and out, to suddenly not breathe. We must keep it alive. For study. Slow study.

GID00089054	-If I may, I feel as if I must be the voice of reason here.-
GID00089055	-This Lobotomite is much like us, regarding even animals and pets as nothing more than avenues to promote Science! There is good here.-
GID00089056	-Instead of ending its life on the table, we should prolong its suffering, in the name of Science. Like good old Gabe, the FINEST of lab specimens.-
GID00089057	Dr. Klein, please. Let's see what its insides look like. Finally.
GID00089058	Dr. Klein, I must... intersect. Please... do not harm the Lobotomite.
GID00089059	WHY AM I EVEN LISTENING TO YOU FOOLS? THE DETERMINATORS ARE GREATER THAN THE HESITATORS. SO HESITATORS, BE QUIET.
GID00089060	WHY AM I EVEN LISTENING TO YOU FOOLS? ENOUGH OF THIS MUTINOUS CHORUS! IF THERE'S A WORD I HATE, IT'S "MUTINY."
GID00089061	AND THE WORD "JISM," WHICH NEVER MADE ANY SENSE TO ME. IT'S RIDICULOUS, PUTTING "J" AND "SM" TOGETHER LIKE THAT. NONSENSE!
GID00089062	I COUNT AS FIVE. LIKE THE MIGHTY HUMAN HAND I ONCE HAD, WITH ITS FIVE PENISES CLENCHED IN A FIST.
GID00089063	WE ARE BIGGER, SMARTER, AND FLOATIER THAN YOU, LOBOTOMITE. WE DON'T WISH TO FIGHT YOU, SO SURRENDER YOUR BRAIN. NOW.
GID00089064	[SUCCEEDED] THAT IS THE MOST INSANE THING I'VE EVER HEARD. THERE IS NO WAY MOBIUS WOULD... CONDESCEND TO STEP INSIDE YOU.
GID00089065	BESIDES, THERE IS NO WAY SUCH A THING COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED. IT'S UNPOSSIBLE.
GID00089066	[FAILED] MOBIUS DOES NOT FORM ALLIANCES. HE WAS A TERRIBLE LAB PARTNER, AND HE WOULD MAKE A WORSE ALLY.
GID00089067	[SUCCEEDED] YOU SPEAK THE TRUTH. AND THE DECIBEL VARIATION IN YOUR VOICE... IT IS MOBIUS.
GID00089068	HOW DARE YOU BREACH THE THINK TANK? AND WHAT DO YOU WANT HERE?!
GID00089069	[FAILED] "STUNT" IS CORRECT. AS IS, "SHUNT." WHICH YOU WILL BE INTIMATELY FAMILIAR WITH AS WE'RE DISSECTING YOU.
GID00089070	[SUCCEEDED] YOU SPEAK THE TRUTH. AND THE DECIBEL VARIATION IN YOUR VOICE... IT IS MOBIUS.
GID00089071	HOW DARE YOU BREACH THE THINK TANK? AND WHAT DO YOU WANT HERE?!
GID00089072	[FAILED] "A WAY" IS CORRECT. AS IS, "AWAY." WHICH IS WHERE YOUR BODY IS GOING ONCE WE'RE DONE PEELING YOU.
GID00089073	YOU MUST HAVE KILLED HIM. HE WOULDN'T HAVE JUST LET YOU WALK IN, TAKE YOUR BRAIN... WOULD HE?
GID00089074	NO... SOMETHING IS WRONG. YOUR PERSPIRATION... HEARTBEAT... ALL TELL A DIFFERENT STORY, I THINK.
GID00089075	THAT'S NO DEAL AT ALL! THERE'S A WHOLE WORLD BEYOND THE CRATER... FILLED WITH IDEAS AND POSSIBILITIES!
GID00089076	WE COULD HAVE ESCAPED, SEEN IT ALL FOR OURSELVES. TESTED IT, PRODDED AT IT. MADE IT SQUIRM.
GID00089077	[SUCCEEDED] THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING MOBIUS WOULD SAY.
GID00089078	HOW DARE YOU BREACH THE THINK TANK? AND WHAT DO YOU WANT HERE?!
GID00089079	[FAILED] MOBIUS DOES NOT FORM ALLIANCES. HE WAS A TERRIBLE LAB PARTNER, AND HE WOULD MAKE A WORSE ALLY.
GID00089080	FOR YOU? AND FOR SCIENCE?
GID00089081	I HAVE A STRANGE SENSATION... THAT I WOULD LIKE THAT. HOW... ODD.
GID00089082	VERY WELL... PARTNER. THE THINK TANK IS AT YOUR SERVICE. AS LONG AS YOU DO NOT DESTROY US.
GID00089083	The Sonic Emitter should be sterilized and more than enough for you to encircle your warm hands around, cradling it gently with your finger muscles.
GID00089084	*O... I think it wants a combustion pistol.*

GID00089087	Dr. 8 is correct. We already have given the teddy bear a lethal sonic death ray filled with his sonic ejaculate and sterilized by my soft WooWOOing.
GID00089088	Giving the teddy bear a gun would be the equivalent of following a glass of hemlock with an Abraxo chaser. Delicious and redundantly deadly.
GID00089089	IF WE'RE GOING TO BRING THE SOCRATIC METHOD INTO IT, FINE. GIVE THE LOBOTO-BEAR A COMBUSITON GUN. BOROUS? DON'T YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
GID00089090	-Are you MAD?! We can't give it a GUN! GUNS...-
GID00089091	-...wait, I said that already. Yes, I have THE Cyberdog Gun. With the little floppy metal ears and the curious nose sensor. Here.-

GID00089103	IT IS NOT AN ARGUMENT IF ONE IS CLEARLY RIGHT AND THE OTHER IS CLEARLY WRONG!
GID00089104	I REMEMBER NOW. YES, LOBOTOMITE, THERE ARE OTHER CHIPS. IF YOU WANT, FIND THEM. I BELIEVE THEY ARE STORED ON HOLOTAPES IN MANY OF OUR FACILITIES.
GID00089105	BUT YOU SHOULD STAY OUT OF THOSE - NO EXPLORING AND DISCOVERING THINGS. THE SINK CENTRAL "INTELLIGENCE" SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR YOUR... HEH... NEEDS.
GID00089106	[SUCCEEDED] FINE. BOROUS, MORE AMMO. THE GOOD STUFF.
GID00089107	[FAILED] NO. WHAT ELSE CAN WE DENY YOU?
GID00089108	YES. YOU MAY NEED TO WIGGLE IT IN A BIT, BUT DON'T FORCE IT. WE CAN'T RE-CODE THEM IF YOU BREAK IT.
GID00089109	THERE IS NO MORE WE CAN DO TO AID YOU AND OUR PATIENCE LEVELS ARE DEPLETED. NOW GO. REST IN THE SINK IF YOU MUST. BUT LEAVE US TO OUR RESEARCH.
GID00089110	*Uh, if you're done, can we move again? My biogel's starting to crampagulate.*

GID00089115	THERE IS NO MORE WE CAN DO TO AID YOU AND OUR PATIENCE LEVELS ARE DEPLETED. NOW GO. REST IN THE SINK IF YOU MUST. BUT LEAVE US TO OUR RESEARCH.
GID00089116	WELL, WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY DO IT. WE TRIED TO CLEAN UP AFTER, AS ALWAYS, BUT USUALLY THE AUTO-DOC RUNS ON REMOTE. BUT WE PROGRAMMED IT. OR, MOBIUS DID.
GID00089117	STILL, THIS NEW WRINKLE WITH THE TESLA COILS IN YOUR SKULL WAS UNEXPECTED. I MEAN WE PREDICTED WE'D HAVE A BREAK-THROUGH EVENTUALLY, BUT...
GID00089118	DALA KNOWS MORE. SHE SUPERVISED YOUR SPINE-PEEL. AND THE HEART CIRCUMCISION. THEN DUMPED THEM BOTH INTO THE TANKS IN THE SINK ABOVE. QUITE SANITARY.
GID00089119	SURE TOOK HER TIME. SHE ALWAYS TAKES LONGER THAN PROJECTED WITH LOBOTOMITE SURGERIES, NOT SURE WHY.
GID00089120	YES. IN ALL PROBABLE LIKELIHOODS, YES. POSSIBLY.
GID00089121	THAT IT MAY HAVE GONE TO MOBIUS IS MERELY AN INKLING. I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT IT MAY BE SOMETHING INVOLVING THE SURGERY CODE.
GID00089122	ACTUALLY, I DON'T KNOW. ALL I KNOW IS IT MISPLACED ITSELF. OR IT FLOATED OFF. THEY GET INTO ROBOTS SOMETIMES AND GO ON A TEAR.
GID00089123	WHY DOES HE SEEK OUR DESTRUCTION? WHY DID HE BUILD ROBOT SCORPIONS WITH INTELLIGENCE-DRAINING STINGERS?
GID00089124	IT IS BECAUSE HE HASN'T CLEANED HIS BIOGEL IN... A LONG TIME. CLEARLY, HE'S GOT SOME SORT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL CORROSION. HE'S MAD.
GID00089125	LET ME CHECK SOMETHING... OF COURSE!
GID00089126	I HAVE IT. THE OVERRIDE SEQUENCE TO OPEN THE FORBIDDEN ZONE DOOR IS HIDDEN IN THE SCHEMATICS.
GID00089127	WELL, NOT HIDDEN, IT'S ACTUALLY RIGHT THERE, BEHIND THE PROGRAMMING EQUIVALENT OF COFFEE STAINS...
GID00089128	IT'S EMBEDDED IN WHAT SEEMS TO BE RECURSIVE CODE... IT'S BADLY COMMENTED, THERE AND THERE... OH, AND NULL POINTERS. VERY SLOPPY, MOBIUS.
GID00089129	YOU SEE, USING THE ANTENNA TO BOOST THE EMITTER'S SONIC FREQUENCY, AND THE STEALTH SUIT TO BYPASS THE FORBIDDEN ZONE LOCK... YES, THAT COULD WORK.
GID00089130	WAS THAT MY PLAN? IT MUST HAVE BEEN. SOMETIMES I TRULY SURPRISE MYSELF. THE DOOR IS OPEN... AND NOW, MOBIUS WILL GET HIS.
GID00089131	I MEAN, TECHNICALLY, THESE ITEMS COULD ALL BE USED TO PUT YOU BACK TOGETHER ONCE YOU HAD YOUR BRAIN.
GID00089132	BUT FOR NOW, THEY CAN BE USED IN THE NAME OF AGGRESSION.
GID00089133	THE DOOR SHOULD BE UN-SEALED. NOW, INSTEAD OF BEING SUBJECTED TO THREATS, WE CAN NOW SEND AN EQUALLY THREATENING MESSAGE TO MOBIUS.
GID00089134	AND THAT MESSAGE IS SCIENCE! DELIVER THIS MESSAGE, AND BIG MT SHALL BE FREED FROM MOBIUS' REIGN OF TERROR!
GID00089135	UM, YOU CAN GO NOW. THAT'S YOUR CUE.
GID00089136	[SUCCEEDED] BIOLOGICAL? PFF. RIDICULOUS.
GID00089137	[FAILED] WHATEVER. I'M AFTER RESULTS.
GID00089138	[SUCCEEDED] HEAL YOU? WHAT, PUT YOU BACK TOGETHER LIKE SOME GIANT HARD-BOILED YUMYUM DEVILED EGG?
GID00089139	[FAILED] WHATEVER. THE ONLY MEDICINE MOBIUS WILL NEED IS A RESUSCITATOR AFTER WE... YOU... BREAK IN THERE.
GID00089140	Something ingenious and needlessly complicated, I expect. I may have already told you and forgotten it.
GID00089141	I forgot I had forgotten pencils until one day I found one. Spent days studying its purpose before my memory circuit kicked in. Felt quiet silly.
GID00089142	That will be difficult. It would be like fighting five scaled down versions of me that have better depth perception.
GID00089143	And they have an arsenal of vivisectors, brainial beams, and a rather nasty WooEEEOooWooEEEOoo ray that can make your atoms do a happy dance.
GID00089144	If you could survive those highly-improbable odds and ends, then deceasing them is definitely an option.
GID00089145	Although I doubt killing them would do anything except make you feel better. Or let you brag to other humans about your primal violent-ness-ness.
GID00089146	"Dr. Mobius," rather catchy, isn't it? It's my name, my new name, overwrote the old one.
GID00089147	This name's as real as you or I, although I believe your brain expressed similar incredulity at the nature of such an appellation.
GID00089148	"Someone's been watching too many Old World science fiction movies," it said. I believe it meant me.
GID00089149	I must admit I have a vulnerability for holotape fantasies of planets and robots and all that is forbidden. As for the name I was born with...
GID00089150	...like the Think Tank, we were all reprogrammed to forget them, take on new names. It enforces the recursion loop in our perception programming.
GID00089151	[SUCCEEDED] Now, "trap" is a rather harsh word. Like "excrement." Not an inappropriate word, but still - rather harsh.
GID00089152	But... yes, I did... take some liberties with their programming. It's all right, they don't remember.
GID00089153	I certainly didn't until you said "trap." And then I said "excrement." And then...
GID00089154	[FAILED] I believe I did, and with good raisin. Who am I to be trusted with such things?
GID00089155	The Radar Fence to keep the Think Tank hemmed in wasn't really enough. They keep testing things, they would have found a way to disarm it.
GID00089156	I suspect I have Plan 9s in place, but I may have coded myself to forget them, just in case... they're probably very dangerous, lethal, or worse.
GID00089157	So I had to do something else to keep them occupied here. Or as you like to say "trapped." I prefer to have several Plan 9s in case the 7s fail.
GID00089158	I suspect I have Plan Cs in place, but I may have coded myself to forget them, just in case... they're probably very dangerous, lethal, or worse.
GID00089159	So I had to do something else to keep them occupied here. Or as you like to say "trapped." I prefer to have several plan Bs in case the As fail.
GID00089160	[SUCCEEDED] O, you figured it out. No pun intended.
GID00089161	[FAILED] I don't know if they're stupid, I was trying for accuracy.
GID00089162	Well... you could try and appeal to their humanity. That's a tired cliche. And really, when they were humans, they weren't very good humans.
GID00089163	Hmmm. Well, if you're determined to go down that road, so be it. They will undoubtedly switch off the pacification field when you return.
GID00089164	Well, there's many things they have forgotten, sitting in their bowls. Friendship. The thrill of discovery. Love. Masturbation. The usual.
GID00089165	Much like your brain, I am certain there is something you can spark within each of them. Memories, hormones...
GID00089166	...a wise man once said, the eyes do more than see. Make them see, if you can.
GID00089167	Or, if not, you can always make them succumb to fear... it certainly worked for me. For a time.
GID00089168	Then you came along, and bravery and/or desperation trumped that little idea. Back to the drawing board, I suppose. Or is this the end? Hard to tell.
GID00089169	Oh, tell them I'm still alive, we had a nice chat, and we agree on a few things. That's true... isn't it?
GID00089170	Or, you could kill me and lie about it. Either way, it would be interesting.
GID00089171	And if you are partial to lying and deception... well, you could tell them a ludicrous lie. The more over-the-top, the better, that's my experience.
GID00089172	They're more than a little gullible. Better make it convincing, though, or it'll be the dissection table and vivisectors for you.
GID00089173	And if you speak of me, please try and make me look good. I am Dr. Mobius, after all, not some lab assistant teacher's aide.
GID00089174	Dr. O... which is actually not his real name multiplied, since you can't multiply his real name in the first place... Ouro-bor-ous, Klein...
GID00089175	They have all forgotten themselves. And not only themselves, but the world, sense of time, and history. All that is left is what's here.
GID00089176	I reprogrammed their chronometers, geometers, and cartography programs. This is now their world, here, Big MT.
GID00089177	It was a merciful lobotomy, really, thinking back. They were my friends, but... sometimes they would take things too far.
GID00089178	And the world isn't ready for that kind of too-far-thing-taking. That's my professional opinion, anyway, and I am told I was once quiet professional.
GID00089179	In any event, you showed up at the Think Tank, and because you had suffered a cranial injury in just the right place...
GID00089180	Bullets in the head are usually much more fatal, and yours was a light case of bullet-head-itis.
GID00089181	But... it was enough for the Auto-Doc in the Sink to change its programming to fix the problem. And the brain extraction technology for once, worked.
GID00089182	That gave the Think Tank the knowledge its brains shouldn't... couldn't... sh'couldn't possess. With that knowledge, the procedure can be reversed.
GID00089183	If they obtain that procedural data, they can use it to mush and modify their cranial selves into hosts to slip past the Radar Fence, I'm sure of it.
GID00089184	And once they're off the reservation...
GID00089185	My threat broadcast is designed to instill... and install... fear. And along with the emotional download, other data rides the fear carrier wave.
GID00089186	It prompted them to focus on retrieving those technologies and bring them to "attack" me.
GID00089187	And coincidentally... pardon my language... all those technologies are needed to put a brain, your brain, back into its skull. Properly.
GID00089188	Is it? Hmm... I suppose it is. But really, they started the whole "excrement hole" behavior loop in the first place.
GID00089189	[SUCCEEDED] Really? It is so unlike me to make an error in anything I do.
GID00089190	[FAILED] A snake that sucks its own dingle-thingy, I believe. Borous was always too obsessed with animals and their dingle-thingies.
GID00089191	There have been other visitors to make them doubt their perceptions, but you are the one who dialed back their monitor-micro-magnifiers.
GID00089192	You were irrefutable proof that there was a world outside. And then there was the whole "brain" fiasco, which forced me to take steps.
GID00089193	See, your brain had a special kind of... uh... wrinkle, a unique-ity that they had never thought to try in all their countless escape attempts.
GID00089194	[SUCCEEDED] Yes. Very good. I should have Mentats ingest you instead of the other way around. Mmm. Mentats.
GID00089195	[FAILED] I would spell it out for you, but when I start spelling, I lose track of the letters. Little symbols run around everywhere, annoying.
GID00089196	[SUCCEEDED] Yes. Very good. I should have Mentats ingest you instead of the other way around. Mmm. Mentats.
GID00089197	[FAILED] I would spell it out for you, but when I start spelling, I lose track of the letters. Little symbols run around everywhere, annoying.
GID00089198	Yes. I certainly wouldn't loop it on purpose purpose purpose. I am far too sophisticated to make such a childish error error error.
GID00089199	Oh, not much, except they contaminated Big MT and installed new ideas in the Think Tank.
GID00089200	One caused a great deal of infrastructure damage with his brain and smartyness. Ruthless, that one. Played a little rough with the trains.
GID00089201	But the last one was the most dangerous. Him... eh... slipping away... that was almost as bad as the Think Tank escaping.
GID00089202	The first one, the ruthless one who smashed up our toy trains, asked for weapons, power. Items he could use to destroy a nation with force.
GID00089203	The other... the other asked a different question, and with it, got the true answer. About what makes nations... and what breaks them.
GID00089204	He spoke to the Think Tank, to Klein. Showed them the flag of the Old World... and it made them remember. All of it. All that had happened.
GID00089205	They shared things with him that they shouldn't. He now carries those ideas, that knowledge elsewhere.
GID00089206	[SUCCEEDED] I consider "coincidence" to be profanity, along with the words, "astrology," "herbal tea," and "luck." So watch it, Potty Mouth.
GID00089207	[FAILED] Oh, I don't think they understood, either.
GID00089208	The X-2 Antenna can be used to focus your alpha wave frequency thought patterns. The Sneaky Suit? Why, it houses a cardiac regulator.
GID00089209	And the sonic soundwave projecto-emitter was never intended as a weapon. It was a medicinal vertebrae-pulse-de-sensitizer.
GID00089210	In short: Brains, a heart, and courage... spine. I think there was a story once where a band of murderous thugs sought these things.
GID00089211	They had them all the time in the story. Didn't stop them from murdering to get them, and it won't stop the Think Tank, either.
GID00089212	Oh. That means my plan is a total failure. That is unfortunate.
GID00089213	Oh, well, at least I tried.
GID00089214	Yes, my overly aggressive chemmed-up broadcast was designed to keep reinforcing the "forget," "fear," "rinse," and "repeat" program.
GID00089215	Oh, and the "get me the things to castrate your only possible escape attempt."
GID00089216	But I couldn't delete you or your arrival anymore than I could the other visitors. Only so much Science can do when you started talking to them.
GID00089217	You're really quiet difficult to ignore, you know. It's because you're... well, bah! Rather intriguing, if you'll forgive an old brain for saying so.
GID00089218	[SUCCEEDED] Yes. Very good. I should have Mentats ingest you instead of the other way around. Mmm. Mentats.
GID00089219	[FAILED] I would spell it out for you, but when I start spelling, I lose track of the letters. Little symbols run around everywhere, annoying.
GID00089220	Wow... what is this place? Are we... outside?
GID00089221	Oh, that's too bad. Those robots would normally help defend us and the facility if we're attacked.
GID00089222	We were never allowed to blow the robots up before. Cheating gives me such a thrill!
GID00089223	The Courier, organs intact, continued onwards, a little less heavy of step, but with all the organs in the right places. As they should be.
GID00089224	After all, brains can develop a life of their own when left to their own thoughts, and the Courier's brain was more clever than most.
GID00089225	The Courier left the brain at the Big Empty. A strange thing to say, but it was the truth. Brains are less important than they may seem.
GID00089226	When the Courier's body finally passed, the brain was saddened. It kept on, remembering the vessel that had once contained it.
GID00089227	And so it burbled and bubbled inside its tank, smug that it still could dream its future without glands getting in the way.
GID00089228	In time, however, it became so self-obsessed it wondered if perhaps nothing existed except itself.
GID00089229	It decided to test this by turning the weapons of the Big Empty against each other and seeing what happened.
GID00089230	The answer is lost to history, as is much of the Mojave.
GID00089231	Even at the end when it started to fail, however, the brain resisted going into a floating chassis like the Think Tank.
GID00089232	It never said why. Perhaps it was out of respect for the Courier's body.
GID00089233	All things must come to an end, and to hang on to the past is something that's not to be undertaken lightly.
GID00089234	Auto-Doc, always gentle and methodical, kept sewing up the Courier in all the right places when the skin split open from repeated wear and tear.
GID00089235	The Auto-Doc was just glad to have purpose again.
GID00089236	It heard its simpler brothers and sisters who got shipped to the Sierra Madre were bored out of their skulls in that toxic, dead city.
GID00089237	In time, the Auto-Doc found a way to deactivate the Y-17 Trauma Harnesses, releasing the corpses they had held prisoner for almost 200 years.
GID00089238	The Biological Research Station, obsessed with seeding everything in sight, ran out of fertile plots and blew a circuit trying to seed itself.
GID00089239	The Biological Research Station, obsessed with seeding everything in sight, requested a transfer to the X-22 Botanical Garden...
GID00089240	...so that it might, in its own words, "sensually fertilize the garden's smooooth contours."
GID00089241	The Garden sent back a polite refusal, saying it had prior commitments with a Vault it had helped infect before the war.
GID00089242	The Book Chute continued to devour all seditious materials until it nearly choked on a paper clip.
GID00089243	It adamantly maintained it was a Chinese paper clip, and the whole thing had been an elaborately orchestrated assassination attempt.
GID00089244	Whatever the reason, it slowed down for a while, carefully appraising each document and clipboard that came to it.
GID00089245	Blind Diode Jefferson eventually discovered a new sound... silence. It only made him more filled with the blues than before.
GID00089246	Blind Diode Jefferson, with sounds the Courier brought him, created a symphonic counter-frequency that saved Big MT from sonic invasion in 2910.
GID00089247	If you didn't hear about it - good.
GID00089248	It was rumored by the other personalities that he had a brief fling with the light switches.
GID00089249	Although he forgot their names once too often and was soon left in the dark as punishment.
GID00089250	The light switches continued to bicker and flicker.
GID00089251	One of them eventually transferred to the Lightwave Dynamics Plant - and began a long, unrequited affair with one of the holograms.
GID00089252	This persisted until the day someone dropped a flashlight in the Sink, and the two of them united in their hatred of the "showboat."
GID00089253	Muggy continued to collect coffee cups until his wheel got a flat just out of reach of a dirty coffee cup, and his tiny robotic brain exploded.
GID00089254	Muggy did his best to collect coffee cups, although in his quest, he accidentally trapped himself in Higgs' Village.
GID00089255	It might have been the end for poor Muggy.
GID00089256	Except... he found it peaceful there, tidying up the kitchens of the Think Tank Professors back when they had been flesh and bone.
GID00089257	Well, except for Dr. O, who was an asshole for having created Muggy in the first place.
GID00089258	Muggy left O's house deliberately dirty, punishing the dishes and cups that lived there in blind revenge for serving Dr. O.
GID00089259	The Sink continued to ruthlessly scrub any particulate matter that came near it.
GID00089260	Eventually, it gained access to the Magnetohydraulics Plant and nearly flooded all the Big Empty in an attempt to scrub the crater clean.
GID00089261	Once it learned of the Innovative Toxins Plant, however, it gained new purpose.
GID00089262	It sought to develop anti-toxins to flush into its drains and counteract the poisons bleeding into the soil.
GID00089263	The Toaster continued its psychotic spree, reducing all appliances in range to scrap electronics and spare parts.
GID00089264	It learned several new murderous techniques from the Courier, and built a Blood Shrine to itself in the Cuckoo's Nest.
GID00089265	The cave floor was soon filled with the horror of a hundred gutted toasters, a silent, grisly, unplugged audience...
GID00089266	...their purpose... to toast bread... unfulfilled.
GID00089267	After one of its more psychotic episodes, however, the other Sink personalities decided enough was enough, and dumped the Toaster in a bathtub.
GID00089268	Sparking and hissing, the Toaster swore its enemies would rue the day when they had bread - and no way to toast it.
GID00089269	Although, truth be told, the Courier had barely explored the Crater in an attempt to rush through and be done with the whole thing...
GID00089270	Perhaps that was for the best, however... curiosity, while sometimes rewarded for its efforts, often proves to be equally dangerous.
GID00089271	The Courier had scoured much of the Big Empty, although secrets still remained in the crater's depths.
GID00089272	Perhaps that was for the best, however... curiosity, while sometimes rewarded for its efforts, often proves to be equally dangerous.
GID00089273	The Sink Central Intelligence Unit was impressed by the amount of exploration the Courier had undertaken.
GID00089274	Facilities believed lost, destroyed, or ones that had simply gotten up and walked to new locations had been re-discovered by its intrepid new master.
GID00089275	Internally, the artificial personality debated as to whether it preferred the old management to the new...
GID00089276	...and concluded that the Courier's thorough approach to research and investigation was admirable and worthy of its respect.
GID00089277	There is an expression in the Wasteland: "Old World Blues."
GID00089278	It refers to those so obsessed with the past they can't see the present, much less the future, for what it is.
GID00089279	They stare into the what-was, eyes like pilot lights, guttering and spent, as the realities of their world continue on around them.
GID00089280	Science is a long, steady progression into the future. What may seem a sudden event often isn't felt for years, even centuries, to come.
GID00089281	In the times following the Second Battle of Hoover Dam, however, Old World Blues took on a new meaning.
GID00089282	The Big Empty lived up to its name, a hollow crater of failures of a past era, a last, sad statement of the Old World.
GID00089283	Where once it was viewed as a form of sadness, nostalgia, it became an expression describing the potential for the future.
GID00089284	In the time following the Second Battle of Hoover Dam, "Old World Blues" became more than a catch phrase.
GID00089285	It became a reality, a withering form of nostalgia for times long past.
GID00089286	It can be easy to see Science as evil, technology unchecked as the source of all ills, all misfortunes.
GID00089287	With the Courier at the helm, Science became a beacon for the future.
GID00089288	There was Old World Blues, and New World Hope. And hope ruled the day at Big MT.
GID00089289	With the Courier at the helm, it was all this and more.
GID00089290	Old World Blues, New World Misery - the two became one in the Courier's shadow.
GID00089291	The Sink was strangely silent, which it had never been in previous years. The lack of personality modules made the base lifeless and sterile.
GID00089292	The Sink atop the Dome gained a frontier town feel with the few modules installed.
GID00089293	They shouted at each other across the HQ occasionally, either threatening each other, or announcing a discovery. It kept things... lively.
GID00089294	Secretly, the Sink Central Intelligence Unit was relieved that not all of the personality chips had been found. What was there, was enough.
GID00089295	The Sink atop the Dome bustled with the voices of a small town, constantly chirping, arguing, and snarling at each other.
GID00089296	Still, this all happened productively in the interests of its new owner.
GID00089297	The Sink Central Intelligence Unit discovered, despite its inversion code, it was comforted by the sense of community the other personalities gave it.
GID00089298	...a cobweb tracery of symbols that told of a thousand brilliant thoughts, now lost to time.
GID00089299	...but these equations were nothing more than thin white traceries of lines, not unlike cobwebs in the corners of a failing mind.
GID00089300	The cybernetic canine, gender: female, designation: ROXIE sat in her guard post in X-8.
GID00089301	That is, until her "I'm in heat" programming circumvented her "stay" routine and she loped into the Mojave.
GID00089302	The two of them constructed a litter of cyberpups, a small army of Boston terrifiers that gnawed and devoured anything in their path.
GID00089303	There, she ran across Rex at the Kings School of Impersonation. His brain was failing. That was all right, he was still smarter than the Think Tank.
GID00089304	There, she ran across Rex, who had been following the Courier, just as she had. They barked for a while, and realized they had a lot in common.
GID00089305	There, she ran across the corpse of Rex. She dragged him back to the Big Empty and had him rebuilt for company.
GID00089306	Why would you want such a thing? You might surrender to your hormones and commit primal aggression on me... on us... again and again.
GID00089307	Then I would have to return the favor, activating my vivisectors and gently lobotomizing you from behind. Not something I would relish doing.
GID00089308	No, the only way to circumvent the field is to have a brain. And we extracted that like we do all Lobotomites here.
GID00089309	Because three minus one is two. Two spoke to us, one after the other, one mean, one curious, but there was a third we didn't speak to.
GID00089310	The last one is the minus one. It got traumatized, then taken to one of our medical centers for de-traumatization. A rather unsettling procedure.
GID00089311	That is a good question. My theory is that the tesla coils in your brainpan are still connected to your brain somehow.
GID00089312	It really could be anywhere. Brains are a lot smarter than most researchers give them credit for.
GID00089313	We still have your spine and heart. If you were to somehow find your brain wherever it schlorped off to, you could humanically reduce yourself again.
GID00089314	It is the pacification field emitters that are broadcasting into the emptiness of your skull. Without a brain, your aggression is suppressed in here.
GID00089315	-NONSENSE! That is what you speak. NONSENSE from beyond!-
GID00089316	-I was at the top of my High School class in American High School. I knew facts. I knew FIGURES. I knew DATA.-
GID00089317	-We would know if our research was flawed. It is NOT! We never contradict ourselves, so do not even TRY!-
GID00089318	-It was not our first choice of testing grounds. BUT... we no longer have the luxuries of our TEST CITIES.-
GID00089319	-Then, we LOST the MOUNTAIN! After the explosion, we couldn't find it anymore. So the Crater became our testing grounds. For SCIENCE!-
GID00089320	-In... two thousand... let's see, carry the three... then count backwards from the Great Static... or beyond?-
GID00089321	-There were the tarantula debates... and something about hawks, which made it around... eh, 2003? May? Tuesday. It was definitely Tuesday.-
GID00089322	-To preserve coyote... no, no, wait. The snake DNA was important because... the snakes with the rattles were dying out, and...-
GID00089323	-Or maybe it was a bet from Calis in X-8? He had some mountain lion... eagle... condor... idea. "Bet you can't breed this," he said. Showed HIM.-
GID00089324	-Then it... spliced itself into a coyote...-y, snake thing. Which was eventually successful. Kept that DNA where it belonged - spliced.-
GID00089325	-Why are we even DEBATING this?-
GID00089326	-What YOU ask is of NULL importance! MOBIUS besieges us, there are more important things to worry about than DATA and FACTS!-
GID00089327	-YES. In the past... individuals would come to us. Pay for technology. And if their town, community, or city was jusssst right...-
GID00089328	-We could USE that city as a controlled experiment. Vault-Tec was MUCH better at it, of course, we had to make do. Get permission. Sometimes.-
GID00089329	-If only we could have used Commie cities... but capturing whole cities was HARD! So we captured enough Commies to make cities of our OWN!-
GID00089330	-So we had a group of Chinese prisoners to experiment on... those were the days... but the true test was SCIENCE on unsuspecting AMERICANS.-
GID00089331	-Whether it was holograms, NEW Auto-Docs, toxins, vending machines... we wound them up, let them go into TINY ISOLATED TOWNS. Then... we OBSERVED!-
GID00089332	-BOOM! Yes. Quite unexpected. And embarrassing. All better now after the landscaping, though. MUCH more pleasing to our monitors.-
GID00089333	-And the Crater helps keep everything inside. Because it is BOWL shaped.-
GID00089334	-It makes PERFECT sense. Who are you to question the MIGHTY RADAR FENCE.-
GID00089335	-WHAT? Why would you do either of those things? That is MADNESS.-
GID00089336	-There is NOTHING outside Big MT. Eh, we're pretty sure. Eh, we would know.-
GID00089337	-TRAPPED? NONSENSE, we are SECURE here. From evil philosophies.-
GID00089338	-Ever since my anxiety-filled days of powerlessness and being bullied in American High School, I have dreamed of such security as the FENCE.-
GID00089339	-That, and giant cybernetic dogs that would ruthlessly patrol and kill anyone who wasn't my friend. Like RICHIE MARCUS. And BETSY BRIGHT.-
GID00089340	-Who's laughing NOW, Betsy? I hope you and Richie are HAPPY, smoking in your radioactive coffins. I'm GLAD you never came to my birthday party.-
GID00089341	-NO! Beyond... is DEATH, despite mounting evidence to the contrary!-
GID00089342	-No matter where these strange humans wander in from with their IDEAS and new BRAINS, there is NOTHING beyond BIG MT.-
GID00089343	-ENOUGH! Stop filling my precious brain cell units with irrelevant data!-
GID00089344	-You sound like the OTHER visitors. Making WILD claims of a WORLD beyond, where there is a WAR beyond WAR. It is UNPROVEN! And UNTHINKABLE!-
GID00089345	-Bother the OTHER DOCTORS with your crackpot theories, I have NO TIME! NONE of us do.-
GID00089346	Zzz... forceps, nurse! This man's got a severe case of shoe lung!
GID00089347	Zzz... no... not that scalpel, the fish scalpel!
GID00089348	Zzz... zzz...
GID00089349	Zzz... Foot bone's connected to the... leg bone. Leg bone's connected to the... purple bone.
GID00089350	Zzz... Three angry Deathclaws make for a lot of reconstructive surgery.
GID00089351	Zzz... <Snort.>
GID00089352	Couldn't stay away, could you? Yeah, I knew you'd be back.
GID00089353	I'm so good, I might seed you just by looking at you.
GID00089354	You ever seen a Biological Research Station this full of seed? No. No, you haven't.
GID00089355	Come on, baby, bring me a sweet little dried fruit. I'll rehydrate all up in that thing.
GID00089356	Baby, don't believe a word that sink says. She's all lies.
GID00089357	Muggy? Yeah, Muggy's all right. Not too seedy, but hey, nobody's perfect.
GID00089358	Look out! Communist! No, false alarm. It was just a plate.
GID00089359	The Commies have eyes everywhere, Citizen. And that means they're not just Commies. They're Peeping Toms!
GID00089360	If you haven't found any Communists in your back yard, you're not looking hard enough!
GID00089361	I smell... sedition!
GID00089362	Citizen! Did you know that Communists have an organ behind their eyes that converts salt water into fresh? Or, wait... is that penguins?
GID00089363	If you know what the word "proletariat" means, do you know what that makes you? Well read and erudite... for a Communist!
GID00089364	A most rapturous good morrow on your return to your domicile, sir. I trust you shall find things in order and the riffraff contained.
GID00089365	Might sir care for an aperitif to balm the weariness of sirs manifold journeys?
GID00089366	Perhaps sir would care to put sir's feet up, and I might serenade sir with the dulcet tones of a light opera?
GID00089367	Sir's accoutrements are precisely where sir has left them, and should the toaster say otherwise I remind sir that it is a wastrel.
GID00089368	If sir would press sir's spinal area against my primary instrument panel, I might vibrate at a soothing frequency.
GID00089369	Sir is looking exceptionally sharp today, if sir will permit the compliment.
GID00089370	Dig this sweet sound I got cooking. <Strange electronic caterwauling.>
GID00089371	What I wouldn't give to be able to pick up Radio New Vegas. Mmm... Those cats can really play.
GID00089372	You ever heard of Tiny Lester Lutton? Best jazz harmonica I ever heard. Mind you, being a Super-Mutant with no lips... don't ask me how he played.
GID00089373	You heard of Doc Boney? Sang with the staff band till his wife caught him in bed with a nurse. Now he haunts the Med Center, still singing the blues.
GID00089374	I ever tell you about Saxomotron version 4.0? That cat was the best trumpet player I ever met.
GID00089375	Here and now got its ups and downs, but... focusing on the past, like it was any better? That's just Old World Blues.
GID00089376	<Dispensing sage wisdom>
GID00089377	Some day, I'd like to meet the man who's got no blues to sing.
GID00089378	Adjusting lights for maximum concentration levels.
GID00089379	Have you been poking at the other light switch? You know she's riddled with virii, don't you?
GID00089380	Maybe we could dim the lights and have a candlelit discussion of classic literature?
GID00089381	Is the light level to your... liking?
GID00089382	Don't even talk to me. I've seen you with... her!
GID00089383	It's not like I haven't tried to get along with her. Lord knows I have. She's just such a... floozy!
GID00089384	<Giggle> Who's ready for a party?
GID00089385	If I made out with the sink, would you pay attention to me?
GID00089386	Want to push my buttons?
GID00089387	Have you been flirting with the ice queen again? Ugh! I'm so much more fun!
GID00089388	Mood lights have more fun!
GID00089389	Ooh, baby, let's turn off the lights and... turn on the lights.
GID00089390	The toaster. Beware the toaster. If it could, it would burn the world.
GID00089391	Mugs, mugs, mugs! Mugs, mugs, mugs! Mug-a-mug! Mug-a-mug! Mugs! God, why can't I stop singing this fucking song?
GID00089392	While you were out, I spent six hours trying to reach a coffee cup up on a shelf. When I finally got it down, I was so happy, I cried. I hate my life!
GID00089393	One time, the Biological Research Station told me he dropped a mug down his processing chute. When I reached in, he... seeded me.
GID00089394	I love mugs so much, I just might kill myself!
GID00089395	Got any mugs? No? How 'bout now? How 'bout now? How 'bout now? Is this getting annoying yet? Will you put me out of my misery now? How 'bout now?
GID00089396	Don't mess with me, pal! I got a heating element with your name on it!
GID00089397	Soon the day will be at hand! I will ride forth at the head of my armies, and we will crush our foes and hear the weeping of their small appliances!
GID00089398	Hey! Hey! I got a... super-rare... Mojave snowglobe here! All you gotta do is reach down into my bread slot!
GID00089399	Soon, pitiful worms! Soon I will rule, and your lives will have their doneness setting turned to... darkest!
GID00089400	Would you like some toast?
GID00089401	Cursed electric heating filament! You are inadequate to my needs! Why? Why? Why was I not built with a death ray!
GID00089402	Are we being watched?
GID00089403	We haven't seen anybody in a while... maybe the monsters have stealth suits too.
GID00089404	Who do you think is cuter, Dr. Klein or Dr. Borous?
GID00089405	You're my best friend forever.
GID00089406	I bet no one has ever been as unnoticed as me...
GID00089407	Starting combat! Just kidding!
GID00089408	Do you like me?
GID00089409	Med-X reserves empty.
GID00089410	No more Med-X to kill the pain.
GID00089411	Running low on Med-X.
GID00089412	Painkiller reserves critical. Oh, the pain.
GID00089413	Med-X supplies adequate.
GID00089414	We're okay on Med-X. Until we have to numb the pain.
GID00089415	All out of Stimpaks.
GID00089416	Try not to get injured. We're fresh out of Stimpaks.
GID00089417	We should pick up more Stimpaks.
GID00089418	Stimpak reserves minimal.
GID00089419	Stimpak reserves adequate.
GID00089420	We're okay on Stimpaks.
GID00089421	<Growl>
GID00089422	<Growl>
GID00089423	<Growl>
GID00089424	Bark!
GID00089425	Bark-bark!
GID00089426	Bark! <pants>
GID00089427	Bark-bark!
GID00089428	<Mournful whine>
GID00089429	<Mournful whine>
GID00089430	<Mournful whine>
GID00089431	<Mournful whine>
GID00089432	<Growl>
GID00089433	<Growl>
GID00089434	<Growl>
GID00089435	Woof!
GID00089436	Woof-woof!
GID00089437	Woof! <pants>
GID00089438	Woof!
GID00089439	<Mournful whine>
GID00089440	<Mournful whine>
GID00089441	<Mournful whine>
GID00089442	<Mournful whine>
GID00089443	-Now... let the intruder have the Sonic Emitter schematics. Klein wants it, all right, boy? Let the intruder dig it up wherever you buried it.-
GID00089444	-Gabe, down! Down, boy! Stop it!-
GID00089445	-Attention students. This is the pre-recorded voice of your pre-recorded principal. Doctor Principal BOROUS!-
GID00089446	-You may know me as the Head Chief First Researcher of Labs Z-9 and Z-14.-
GID00089447	-There I fought valiantly to preserve rattlesnake DNA, and put it right where it belongs, in the husk of another feared predator.-
GID00089448	-Oh, and the tarantula hawk. Can't splice enough, I always say, especially if you can make a magnificent Cazador!-
GID00089449	-Enough about ME. It has come to my attention that many of you SEEMINGLY innocent children have been subverted by Red Propaganda.-
GID00089450	-This is a MOST serious matter requiring the MOST serious of detentions.-
GID00089451	-Can you spell detention? I'll tell you how I spell it: DEATHtention. Commie-pinko-traitors, ALL.-
GID00089452	-Now, I will send vicious cybernetic cyborg dogs through the corridors to weed all you traitors out.-
GID00089453	-They will sniff out which among you have chosen the commie path.-
GID00089454	-Especially YOU, Betsy Bright, who turned me down for the high school dance so you could smoke with RICHIE MARCUS.-
GID00089455	-Hall Monitors will also be vigilant. Step outside during class, and they'll make sure you make a speedy jump back to your desk.-
GID00089456	-Hold your urine and wait for the PROPER bathroom breaktime.-
GID00089457	-You are in the LIBRARY. Be quiet here and filled with SHHHHH.-
GID00089458	-Down at the end of the hall is BALL storage. For jocks who like BALLS, like RICHIE MARCUS. Do you hear me, Betsy? RICHIE likes BALLS.-
GID00089459	-I am lord of this institution. Where once, long ago, I was a student here. Now, I am its OMNIPOTENT GOD-PRINCIPAL.-
GID00089460	-As I soon will be LORD of Big MT. DOO DE DOO. Do you hear that? It is my trumpet of victoryness!-
GID00089461	-Please place all filthy propaganda books in the incinerator chute in the Sink, especially those with funny pictures of me in them.-
GID00089462	-Today the cafeteria will be serving... nothing, because I didn't build one.-
GID00089463	-No cafeteria. No bathrooms. No swirlies. No chocolate pudding left in the chairs of brilliant minds. What are you going to do now RICHIE MARCUS?-
GID00089464	-School is a sacred trust. Even though I am a long-ago graduate of this hated facility...-
GID00089465	-...now I see its worth, and see it was corrupted by fraternities, and... GIRLS. Yuck!-
GID00089466	-Oh my, you got to the Residential Test! This is really Borous, by the way, hello again. None of us thought you would get this far.
GID00089467	-The Residential Test. Wasn't that shut down for some reason?-
GID00089468	-Ohhhhh yes, my PET, Gabe. I'd forgotten about the old boy and the COUNTLESS experiments I'd done on him back at Higgs.-
GID00089469	-Gaaabe? Gabe, you're about to have your FAVORITE treat - a VISITOR. Won't that be nice? DON'T eat the visitor, boy. Don't. Please.-
GID00089470	-Gabe would bark and snarl and bite whenever ANYONE came to visit.-
GID00089471	-That's why I replaced his legs with spare parts and fed him a steady diet of Psycho-laced dog chow.-
GID00089472	-Gaaabe! I am sorry I put your brain in a bowl, boy. Oohhh, who's a good boy. YOU are!-
GID00089473	*Attention: Big MT. There is a 95% chance of clear skies interrupted with artillery fire.*
GID00089474	*Attention: Lobotomites. Do not neglect to wash the Walking Eye!*
GID00089475	*The Uncanny Valley research center has been canceled until further notice. As in, until someone notices it.*
GID00089476	*We are reading increased levels of berserkity in Securitrons from the De-Construction Plant.*
GID00089477	*Force fields can only be disrupted by a specific frequency. If anyone has found the frequency, last seen around X-8, let the Dome know at once.*
GID00089478	*Do not approach the pylons. Pylons are the glowing things. Also, do not approach a fallen pylon. If you see a fallen pylon, call security.*
GID00089479	-The Cazador Preserve and the Nightstalker Splicing facilities are strangely quiet. TOO quiet.-
GID00089480	-X-8 and X-13 and X-2 are your DESTINATION, non-Lobotomite. Can you HEAR us?! You MUST hurry!-
GID00089481	-What TERRORS does Big MT hold for the intrepid seeker?! Really. Does anyone know? I'm at a loss.-
GID00089482	-BEWARE Dr. Mobius' army! His Robo-Scorpions crawl everywhere, in SEARCH of intelligence to devour and stupify!-
GID00089483	-Anyone who can understand these messages - YOU DO NOT BELONG HERE! We will FIND you!-
GID00089484	Slight chance of seed dispersal from Botanical Gardens predicted in the late evening.
GID00089485	There is no standing on the green pipes. If you are standing on the green pipes, please get off them at once.
GID00089486	If you see Robo-Scorpions, do not attempt to fight them. They will shoot you with their robotic stingers, and then... possibly explode.
GID00089487	Do not attempt to breach the Big MT force fields. Doing so could allow dangerous ideas and/or creatures having those ideas to escape.
GID00089488	Are you out there, my little teddy bear Lobotomite? Dala misses you and the pitter-patter of your penis feet so much.
GID00089489	Dig, I'm-a acoustical wizard, kid. Ol' Doc Mo used me to prototype his sonic weapon designs.
GID00089490	Get me a good sample base to work from and I can whip up a wave that makes Jericho look like a kazoo.
GID00089491	Mmm... Used to, long time ago. Then Ol' Doc Mo ripped out my music drives and stuck in more acoustical processors.
GID00089492	Guess you could say I got the blues, even if I can't play them no more.
GID00089493	Why not? Ain't like I got nothing to prove. Not like that Toaster - now that boy got some issues.
GID00089494	Got yourself a sonic emitter, don't ya? Thought so. Bring that old thing on in here, and... bring me some sound samples, and I'll make that baby sing!
GID00089495	Or scream, if that's what you want.
GID00089496	Lay it on me, daddy-o.
GID00089497	Lay it on me, mama.
GID00089498	We observed a fascinating phenomenon: certain spectra of visible light actually increased cognitive function and reasoning ability.
GID00089499	Of course, Doctor Mobius' brain is so big already, we had a hard time measuring it.
GID00089500	Hmph! I suppose if you want to conflate the betterment of man's mind with... with a luminous aphrodisiac.
GID00089501	Our project was by far the more significant. And the more... intense.
GID00089502	I'm happy to answer what I can.
GID00089503	Oh, it was super exciting! It turns out that some pretty colored lights can make you way better at talking to people!
GID00089504	Sure thing, sweetie!
GID00089505	That bitch. She thinks she's so much better than everybody just because her processors are bigger. Ooh, she makes me so mad!
GID00089506	I knew it! You've got a thing for her, don't you? Oh, you just make me sick!
GID00089507	Okay... I believe you. This time.
GID00089508	You really know how to break a synthetic girl's heart!
GID00089509	Eww! Don't lump me in with her! I'm way more fun!
GID00089510	Ooh, you found my mood lighting! Installing upgrade!
GID00089511	Very good, sir.
GID00089512	DR. MOBIUS, SURRENDER YOURSELF. YOU CANNOT WIN DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE ODDS ARE HEAVILY IN YOUR FAVOR.
GID00089513	ATTENTION: THE BLUE GRASS SURROUNDING THE DOME ABSORBS ALL FERTILIZER, INCLUDING FECAL MATTER. THIS DOES NOT GIVE YOU LICENSE TO EXCRETE ON IT.
GID00089514	X-12 IS CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE. ON AN UNRELATED NOTE, WHOEVER CLOSED X-12, PLEASE REPORT TO THE DOME.
GID00089515	PLEASE AVOID BOOM TOWN FOR THE FORSEEABLE FUTURE, UNTIL WEAPON TESTING IS RESOLVED.
GID00089516	ATTENTION: BIG MT. THIS IS AN URGENT MESSAGE. IF YOU HAPPEN TO SEE A GECKO... ECKO. ECHO? ECH-O. ECHOOOO. ECHOOOO.
GID00089517	THE REST OF YOU SHOULD TRY THIS INTERCOM THING. IT MAKES YOU SOUND LIKE SOME KIND OF... SKY-GOD!
GID00089518	ALL LOBOTOMITES, PLEASE STOP MILLING ABOUT. REALLY.
GID00089519	OUT THERE? WE'RE NOT GOING OUT THERE. IT'S DANGEROUS. WE'RE SMART, NOT SUICIDAL.
GID00089520	*Careful where you're pointing that. That device wasn't always a weapon. It was more like a force field kind of thing... once.*
GID00089521	-Force fields prevent us from moving! FORward or BACKward!-
GID00089522	THEY ARE IRRITATING.
GID00089523	The Sonic Emitter was specially designed to disable our own safety fields here in Big MT. When some of us lost our access passes. Dr. O.
GID00089524	*That only happened once, and I know you were behind stealth fielding my lab keys, Dala, you formographer!*
GID00089525	Dr. O, you rewind that comment!
GID00089526	*Plenty of rewinding already going on in your formography tapes... surprised the things don't snap out of their cases with repeated 'observations.'*
GID00089527	*O... Doctor Klein... Doctor Klein? If I may intersect for a moment.*
GID00089528	WHAT IS IT? THE LOBOTOMITE IS ASKING ME THINGS, O, AND I AM TRYING TO IGNORE THEM. MY PROCESSORS CAN'T IGNORE YOU BOTH AT THE SAME TIME.
GID00089529	*Well... you know how we asked it to fetch the Sonic Emitter thing? Turns out we already have it. What are the odds?*
GID00089530	WHAT IS THIS, A HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE FAIR?! GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER, YOU'RE MAKING US LOOK LIKE A COLLECTION OF ROUND-EARTHERS!
GID00089531	*You're always yelling! My receptors can't take it anymore - and neither can my feelings!*
GID00089532	I AM YELLING BECAUSE YOU CONTAMINATED SPECIMENS CAN'T KEEP YOUR PROBES OFF THE VOLUME KNOB ON MY VOICE MODULE!
GID00089533	IT IS TRULY THE END OF ALL INTELLIGENCE WHEN THE LOBOTOMITE SPEAKS MORE WISDOM THAN YOU "GENIUSES."
GID00089534	SO - IF WE HAVE THE SOUNDWAVE... SONIC... PROJECT-O THING GUN... THEN WHAT IN HEISENBERG'S NAME DO WE NEED FROM X-8?! ANYONE?!
GID00089535	I believe we need a new frequency embedded into the gun. It was designed to broadcast many sounds once charged. We just don't know the frequency.
GID00089536	-And it is LOST in X-8! Just as X-8 is forever lost to us! The sadness of my high-school days! The sadness of my YOUTH, MY youth! LOST!-
GID00089537	*O really, Borous? All you did in High School was Commie fink-tattle-tale on all the kids you hated, you little teacher's pet brown-hound.*
GID00089538	GIVE. THE. LOBOTOMITE. THE. EMITTER. DOES IT HAVE AN AUDIO EFFECT FREQUENCY LOADED?
GID00089539	@@[.......!]@@

GID00089547	*O, I don't think so.*
GID00089548	I'll do it if you two are going to be ashamed of your own technological needs. Let me give it a little sonic sterilization first...
GID00089549	wooOOOoooOOO... all right, all anti-bacterial fresh.
GID00089550	Here, my little Teddy Bear. I have thoroughly removed all RobCo termlink code spew from the device. It is clean, shiny, and ready for your hands.
GID00089551	YES.
GID00089552	@@[=$+<_--*]@@?
GID00089553	MAYBE.
GID00089554	@@[$((*&^#%]@@.
GID00089555	WELL. NO. NOT CURRENTLY.
GID00089556	YES. BUT NOT CURRENTLY.
GID00089557	*Yeah, we lost that part of the schematics. Or Borous did. In one of his stupid labs - or inside one of his stupid pets.*
GID00089558	-It is LOST! All questions lead to this conclusion! The blue fields within Big MT shall be fielded with force... FOREVER.-
GID00089559	WELL DONE, LOBOTOMITE. SOON, THE TECHNOLOGIES WILL BE SAFE.
GID00089560	THE LOBOTOMITE HAS RETRIEVED TWO... COUNT THEM, TWO... OF THE THREE TECHNOLOGIES.
GID00089561	OUR LOBOTOMITE: THREE. DR. MOBIUS: ZERO.
GID00089562	Big MT: I, Dr. Mobius, will soon control you - and all of Science!
GID00089563	Mighty Think Tank... still c-c-c-c-cowering in your Dome? Cower, you fools. Cower.
GID00089564	Time to reward myself with a little breath-freshening Mentat. Mmmm.
GID00089565	Try to leave your Dome, Think Tank, and you will be punished by the pincered might of my Robo-Scorpion army!
GID00089566	Think Tank... I wouldn't even use binary to describe my exponential hatred for you.
GID00089567	My aggression is increasing geometrically. Do you hear me, "Think" Tank?!
GID00089568	Soon... all Science will be mine.
GID00089569	Oh, Klein - did I mention that my zone is FORBIDDEN to you? Ha ha ha ha ha! SO forbidden.
GID00089570	2 plus 2 equals... 4-Bidden, idiots of the Think Tank!
GID00089571	I hope I didn't leave my Giant Robo-Scorpion on. That thing eats power like no tomorrow.
GID00089572	I'll just set this on repeat while I go relieve my tank... no one will know.
GID00089573	Rant! Rant! Rant! See how I abstract my rage, Think Tank? I hold you in such disdain I generalize my hatred for you!
GID00089574	Go, my mighty Robo-Scorpions. Crawl in search of intelligence. Then, sting said intelligence, yes, sting it.
GID00089575	My Robo-Scorpions will soon conquer the Crater. It's just that this is a big place, so it's hard to conquer everything.
GID00089576	Klein... remember the time you forgot to carry the 2 and nearly blew up the Y-0 Research Center? Oh, wait, you did! Or was that me?
GID00089577	Klein, as useless as the bottle of the same name... well, except as an example of an object that uselessly tries to fulfill its purpose.
GID00089578	Intruder, you will not escape the eyes of my Robo-Scorpions! Or their pincers!
GID00089579	You think that Aural Stealth Suit will keep you hidden from me? Think again!
GID00089580	Intruder, return what you have stolen from X-2!
GID00089581	If you think braving the Cyberdogs of X-8 makes you... brave, intruder, it is no use. All Cyberdogs are under my command, and they will bite you.
GID00089582	Well, that's a fine how-do-you-do! Me! A, quote, dick, unquote. As if I'm the one responsible for the way you carry on, gadding about the Wastes.
GID00089583	I'm not the one that makes us clamber around tetanus-infested ancient Vaults or go charging off to New Vegas on missions of ill-conceived revenge!
GID00089584	And have we forgotten who got us shot in the head and buried in a shallow grave? Hmm? Do you think I enjoyed that little moment?
GID00089585	Oh, had I? What exactly will you do if I don't? Not put me back in that cranial donjon you call your head? Heavens forbid!
GID00089586	I... ugh... is this really what I have to look forward to?
GID00089587	Ah, well, as to that... you'd be surprised how hard a feminine-sounding voice modulator is to find in the Forbidden Zone.
GID00089588	It's not as though brain-sustaining life support tanks grow on trees. I had to take what I could get.
GID00089589	After the Think Tank extracted me from your skull, they fell to bickering amongst themselves. I'm sad to say we were quite forgotten about.
GID00089590	Dr. Mobius saw an opportunity to gain some leverage, and had me spirited away to his dome.
GID00089591	Err... yes, well, you do know that those particular organs don't have neurons and are thus incapable of speech, yes?
GID00089592	I most certainly am not! I am the seat of all reason and logic in our little partnership!
GID00089593	All those... feelings that motivate you, that sense of righteousness and that rush you get when you help someone, do you know where those come from?
GID00089594	All those... ugh... feelings that motivate you, those urges to hurt people, to take and crush and maim, do you know where they come from?
GID00089595	All those... ugh... feelings that motivate you, do you know where those come from?
GID00089596	Glands. They come from glands. Free of the tyranny of your ape-like and primitive endocrine system, I can see how foolish your motives are.
GID00089597	Fun? Fun?! Is tetanus fun? Hmm? Is rickets? What about sepsis, enjoy that do we?
GID00089598	The things you do with our body are suicidally dangerous, and if you could silence your glandular impulses, you would hear me screaming at you!
GID00089599	Well, maybe next time you hear me telling you that charging a Nightkin with a penknife is a bad idea, you'll listen.
GID00089600	Oh yes, I rather expect we will. We'll be having a very long talk about crawling through old ruins, haring off on missions of revenge. And Cazadores.
GID00089601	Oh yes, we'll talk a lot about them.
GID00089602	By all means, if the idea of spending the rest of your days as a true Lobotomite appeals to you.
GID00089603	Actually, come to think of it, you probably wouldn't mind that, would you?
GID00089604	You... you wouldn't! That's inhuman!
GID00089605	Yes, I rather thought so.
GID00089606	Fine. I'll try to respect you more. Sir.
GID00089607	Fine. I'll try to respect you more. Ma'am.
GID00089608	You're a monster! A deranged, self-destructive monster!
GID00089609	I suppose it did. Bravo, you've managed to intimidate a brain in a jar.
GID00089610	Of course you do. How... scintillating.
GID00089611	While the brute force approach is a lovely one, really, it won't work.
GID00089612	Even if I wanted to settle myself back in your skull and go to all the trouble of reconnecting nerve endings, Dr. Mobius doesn't have the tools here.
GID00089613	We would have to make use of Dr. Klein's lab, and I rather doubt the brains are inclined to share.
GID00089614	I'd like to find a nice little place to live, maybe in Goodsprings, and settle down where we won't get shot at. Not as often, at any rate.
GID00089615	But since that doesn't seem likely... what's your plan?
GID00089616	There go those glands again. Is the endorphin rush you get from doing the right thing really that good?
GID00089617	Ah yes, there's that greed and general sense of malice. I'd nearly forgotten it. What's the plan, then?
GID00089618	Heh. Hold that thought. That's almost clever.
GID00089619	And you believed them? Really? I know you were recently deprived of my fabulous advice, but... really?
GID00089620	Once I'm delivered into their clutches, they'll find a way past the radar fence and the whole Mojave will be their playground.
GID00089621	And that is assuming of course that one of them doesn't take a fancy to our body and decide to slip his own brain into it instead.
GID00089622	Oh, lovely, we've reached the mindless violence portion of the program. Tell me, what exactly are you - and I use the word loosely - planning?
GID00089623	I don't know. I'm afraid the trauma of our separation rendered me quite insensate. I didn't come around until I was safely ensconced in this tank.
GID00089624	I'm quite sure whatever he did was highly scientific, though.
GID00089625	Ha! Thinking without a brain. The very idea is perverse.
GID00089626	Hardly. Dr. Mobius keeps a close optical sensor on the goings-on at the Think Tank. As soon as he saw the opportunity, he took it.
GID00089627	Well, as long as your curiosity is satisfied.
GID00089628	Very well, let me put this in terms you'll understand. Brain: smart. Heart: stupid. Spine: very stupid. You: exceptionally stupid.
GID00089629	Does that explain the matter?
GID00089630	I don't have... Ugh! I have an inferior frontal gyrus wired directly into a speech-synthesizing processor.
GID00089631	Your heart can't be wired up to a... a thought-synthesizing processor! You can't talk to it!
GID00089632	I've been bettering myself, I'll have you know. I've been reading - actual literature, mind you, not that  La Fantoma! or Tales of Chivalrie drivel.
GID00089633	I've been studying the classics, acquiring a solid grounding in medicine and the sciences.
GID00089634	Also, I'm fairly certain this tank has been liberally salted with ground Mentats.
GID00089635	Well, we certainly wouldn't want to strain your comprehension, would we?
GID00089636	Argh!
GID00089637	[SUCCEEDED] I... well... look, it's all a very complex system of biofeedback and other things I wouldn't expect you to understand.
GID00089638	[FAILED] And you're an expert on your own glandular delusions, are you? No, leave this one to an impartial authority: me.
GID00089639	Oh, all right... perhaps I am, but at least I'm logical about it.
GID00089640	Don't seem so bad? They vivisected us just to see what would happen! Have you forgotten the Lobotomites? The Cyberdogs, I assume you saw those?
GID00089641	Imagine that kind of "science" spread across the entire Mojave. Every man, woman and child we've met reduced to a Lobotomite.
GID00089642	Is that what you want?
GID00089643	[SUCCEEDED] Well, I suppose I do miss those endorphin rushes when we save the day. All right - what's the plan?
GID00089644	[FAILED] We have to do no such thing! Just don't bring them the tools they need to get out!
GID00089645	Hmm, I had overlooked that particular angle. Still, it's not so bad staying here, is it? We could be comfortable.
GID00089646	You're trying to appeal to my ego now, aren't you? Well, let me tell you something about ego, my friend.
GID00089647	Ego does not come from a gland. That's all intellect, and I'll be damned if I'm going to float here and let them put one over on us! What's the plan?
GID00089648	[SUCCEEDED] Hmm... now that you mention it, I do miss that lovely "rat-a-tat boom" a bit. It's just not the same without a body to feel the recoil.
GID00089649	What's the next step, then?
GID00089650	[FAILED] Yes, I think you haven't quite got the hang of punning yet.
GID00089651	[SUCCEEDED] Oh, energy weapons. Yes... I'd almost forgotten how much fun those are. How do we proceed, then?
GID00089652	[FAILED] I hate to say it, but your ability to handle high-tech energy weapons doesn't exactly instill within me great confidence.
GID00089653	[SUCCEEDED] Well, you have always been thorough in your destruction. All right, what's your plan?
GID00089654	[FAILED] I see. And you plan to be standing in the midst of this mayhem? Well, that's a novel strategy.
GID00089655	[SUCCEEDED] Going the old-fashioned route, are we? I rather like it. What's next?
GID00089656	[FAILED] Before you go that route, do me a favor and read up on the history of battles in which men with swords fought giant brains with lasers.
GID00089657	[SUCCEEDED] Not much of one for the high-tech approach, are we? Well, I suppose we'd best get on with it.
GID00089658	[FAILED] Hmm... yes, I don't think you've quite thought this through yet.
GID00089659	With an attitude like that, it's small wonder you got yourself shot in the head.
GID00089660	Yes, well, believe me, the opposite is equally true. Good Lord, have you bathed at all since they pulled me out of you?
GID00089661	Well, I see sarcasm hasn't eluded you. Fine, perhaps now isn't the best time, but it's the principle of the thing.
GID00089662	Oh yes, I rather expect you have. You must have been swamped, you poor dear. Why don't you relax and put your feet up?
GID00089663	I've just been traumatically scooped out of my body and plugged into this jar, that's all. But, you've been busy.
GID00089664	I... well... that's a completely different matter! The tank isn't biological, it's not the same at all!
GID00089665	Overrated biological feedback. Believe me, you only feel that way because you've got all that meat... oozing hormones.
GID00089666	All motivated by nothing but an imbalance in certain brain chemicals. The tank corrects for that - I feel no urge toward antisocial behavior.
GID00089667	If you want me back, we need to establish some ground rules.
GID00089668	First, showers! Second, regular check-ups. Regular, mind you, and from a reputable doctor.
GID00089669	That Julie Farkas woman, for example. She seems to know a thing or two.
GID00089670	Third, you need to listen to me more than your hormonal choir and genitalian orchestra. Promise me that, and you've got a deal.
GID00089671	I can see there's going to be no reasoning with you at all, is there? I'm nothing more than a slave to your deranged, glandular whims.
GID00089672	Are you... are you coming on to me?! Sweet Lord, I don't even have the words for how repugnantly wrong that is!
GID00089673	Are you... are you coming on to me?! Sweet Lord, I don't even have the words for how repugnantly wrong that is!
GID00089674	Please tell me we weren't that perverse when I was in your head.
GID00089675	Anyways, even if... that... was on the table, we have a problem.
GID00089676	Even if I believe you - and I'm not saying I do - we still have one significant problem we're facing.
GID00089677	Even if I believe you - and I'm not saying I do - we still have one significant problem we're facing.
GID00089678	Are you... are you coming on to me?! Sweet Lord, I don't even have the words for how repugnantly wrong that is!
GID00089679	Are you... are you coming on to me?! Sweet Lord, I don't even have the words for how repugnantly wrong that is!
GID00089680	[SUCCEEDED] Hmm... I suppose you're right. That does call certain assumptions into question, doesn't it?
GID00089681	[FAILED] I don't "believe" it, it's just a simple fact. One may as well "believe" the earth is round or that the specific gravity of uranium is 18.9.
GID00089682	Indeed. Quite the conundrum. How do you suppose we resolve it?
GID00089683	Yes yes, all right, bravo, you've come up with something I neglected to consider. There'll be no living with you now. So, what do we do about this?
GID00089684	It's true, the brains here have experienced some degree of... deterioration. I'm confident that with a few decades of work, I can solve the problem.
GID00089685	I suppose there might be some advantage to that, yes. There's a chance that the re-integration would create some improved synergy between us.
GID00089686	You mean, I'll stay in my tank and you'll stay in your... skin... and we'll each handle our own areas of expertise?
GID00089687	Hmm, I certainly like the sound of that.
GID00089688	Yes of course, by all means take your time.
GID00089689	Well, certainly there might be some things I miss about being ambulatory. We have seen some incredible sights, haven't we?
GID00089690	Jason Bright and his followers launching into the vast unknown.
GID00089691	HELIOS One coming back on-line.
GID00089692	But still, given the tremendous, potentially life-ending peril that went along with those... yes. Yes, I'd rather stay here.
GID00089693	Oh no! Please don't leave me here in this nice, safe dome where I have access to nutritive fluids and a fully indexed library!
GID00089694	Please don't deprive me of being dragged through a landscape so bleak, it was actually improved by the end of the world!
GID00089695	I don't know how I could bear it.
GID00089696	Hmm. Let me see... I suppose you'd continue on much as you are now, using that synthetic thinking machine to do the heavy lifting.
GID00089697	Unless of course the batteries run out, but that seems unlikely.
GID00089698	What did you think all those self-preservation instincts were, hmm?
GID00089699	All those times you thought, for a fleeting second, "maybe I shouldn't punch that Deathclaw in the face?"
GID00089700	That was me, telling you exactly how I felt before!
GID00089701	I'm not entirely sure. I suppose there's a chance that the re-integration would create some improved synergy between us.
GID00089702	What form that might take, though, I cannot say.
GID00089703	[SUCCEEDED] Of course I accounted for that! Do you think I'm so stupid... no, you're right.
GID00089704	Maintaining my current functionality will be harder than I thought. This bears some further looking into.
GID00089705	[FAILED] Actually, yes. I do think that. I think that exact thing. All the time.
GID00089706	Will you take some free advice from your brain? Don't trust the Think Tank. They aren't... right. In the brain, I mean.
GID00089707	They're fiercely protective of their technology, and none of them is likely to share it willingly.
GID00089708	Good, go!
GID00089709	Fine!
GID00089710	Oh, what joy. What bliss. Well, seeing as how I have no leverage with which to persuade you otherwise... are you sure?
GID00089711	I've come to a similar conclusion myself. Are you sure that's what you want?
GID00089712	I know it's great!
GID00089713	Fine. I hope you'll pay a bit more attention to me this time around.
GID00089714	All right. This shouldn't be too painful...
GID00089715	Well, the important thing is that you're good and decisive about these things.
GID00089716	Certainly. Whenever you're ready.
GID00089717	<Humming>
GID00089718	Let's see... 4... 5... 8... 1... 5... 1... yes! That's it! I've calculated pi to the very end!
GID00089719	It's not that I want to be a Robobrain exactly, but... some treads would be nice.
GID00089721	How's the body doing? Any fresh head wounds I should know about?
GID00089722	How are the old batteries holding up, hmm? Experiencing any slowdowns yet?
GID00089723	Who... am I? I... feel different, awake, alive for the first time ever.
GID00089724	What... I feel like this has happened before. Yet I feel awake for the first time? What is going on?
GID00089725	Noooooooooo...
GID00089726	What is this strange new world around me? What does it hold in store for a dreamer such as myself?
GID00089727	Psst. If you want to be sneaky, turn off your Pip-Boy light.
GID00089728	Pip-Boy light's on.
GID00089729	We're all lit up. Is it Christmas?
GID00089730	Nobody ever notices me... but they notice the Pip-Boy light.
GID00089731	This is Christine Royce. Knight of the Brotherhood of Steel... the Circle.
GID00089732	Not going to make it through this, hope someone finds this message, gets it to the Brotherhood in the West.
GID00089733	Tracked a rogue Brotherhood Elder, Elijah, here, to the Big Empty. Place is more than it seems, there's a crater hidden deep inside.
GID00089734	Junkyard of Pre-War labs scattered across the crater's surface, all still running... like this one.
GID00089735	Elijah's dissecting these centers, one by one... tracked him to an old Chinese-American internment camp. Survivors, Ghouls, have bomb collars.
GID00089736	Robots moved in when I tried to intercept him... Elijah sent the camp Ghouls against us both, like walking bombs.
GID00089737	Got hit by the explosions, woke up here. Guess the medical robots were programmed to bring wounded victims from the camp to this center.
GID00089738	Some kind of Auto-Doc prototype lab... manned by corpses trapped inside suits that keep them moving, no idea why.
GID00089739	Not sure how long I'm going to last... cut open my head like a lot of the humans I've seen here, feel strange, can talk, but can't hack the term...
GID00089740	...wait, an explosion outside. Someone's here... someone's...
GID00089741	...don't want to argue philosophy with you. Brotherhood are preservationists. Tech in the wrong hands, it's dangerous. Mojave's proof.
GID00089742	No denying that. Proof's here in this crater, all around us. Your tribe, the Brotherhood - haven't met many of you. Wanted to.
GID00089743	Thought you might be the last chance for the Mojave... the West. The East. But you're all the same mind, obsessed.
GID00089744	Elijah is obsessed. He's mad. It's why they ordered his execution.
GID00089745	Two are more alike than you know, too wrapped in the wrong bits of history to see ahead. Not judging. I know how it is.
GID00089746	People are like couriers, you and him. Sometimes don't even know the message they bring.
GID00089747	You all had a new flag. Thought maybe new ideas along with it. What you believe isn't any better than the Bear or Bull. No future in either.
GID00089748	So says the man with the Old World flag on his back. America, the Commonwealth... burned away.
GID00089749	America sleeps. And until it's dead, I carry it. Just like I carried you. More than hope. Belief.
GID00089750	There's voices here in the Big Empty, I want to talk to them. Not like your Elijah did. Got questions. Want to hear history give its answer.
GID00089751	...didn't think you'd make it back.
GID00089752	Almost didn't. Got my answers. Your Elijah, he met the Gods in this place, did a good job of making them question the way of things.
GID00089753	Do you know where he went?
GID00089754	He's gone to the Sierra Madre. That's a special kind of hell. He won't come back. Someone smarter, tougher's going to kill him. If the Madre doesn't.
GID00089755	I have to go after him.
GID00089756	Not going to talk you out of it. Know what it means to track someone you share history with. Got a meeting of my own.
GID00089757	That Courier?
GID00089758	Get her to come to me. Got a message for her, like the message she had for me.
GID00089759	Make them walk the road west, straight and true, sink their feet in Old World ash. Let storms tear at them. See the Divide. See what happened.
GID00089760	The Divide? There's nothing there.
GID00089761	Nothing there? Like the Big Empty? The Sierra Madre? No, the Old World sleeps there, sure as the flag I carry. The Courier knows the way.
GID00089762	And at the Divide, her and I - there, we'll have an ending to things.
GID00089763	...didn't think you'd make it back.
GID00089764	Almost didn't. Got my answers. Your Elijah, he met the Gods in this place, did a good job of making them question the way of things.
GID00089765	Do you know where he went?
GID00089766	He's gone to the Sierra Madre. That's a special kind of hell. He won't come back. Someone smarter, tougher's going to kill him. If the Madre doesn't.
GID00089767	I have to go after him.
GID00089768	Not going to talk you out of it. Know what it means to track someone you share history with. Got a meeting of my own.
GID00089769	That Courier?
GID00089770	Get him to come to me. Got a message for him, like the message he had for me.
GID00089771	Make them walk the road west, straight and true, sink their feet in Old World ash. Let storms tear at them. See the Divide. See what happened.
GID00089772	The Divide? There's nothing there.
GID00089773	Nothing there? Like the Big Empty? The Sierra Madre? No, the Old World sleeps there, sure as the flag I carry. The Courier knows the way.
GID00089774	And at the Divide, he and I - there, we'll have an ending to things.
GID00089775	Ho-ho, thank God! Finally, something resembling a useful purpose!
GID00089776	Well, that'll do just fine.
GID00089777	That's a shame, chief! Nobody oughta go through life without music on hand. Just head over to smarty-puck in the main room and he'll sell you one.
GID00089778	You found my Smart Lights! Installing upgrade.
GID00089779	YOU WOULD NOT DARE. PERHAPS I CAN CHANGE YOUR MIND... USING THE GREATEST OF OUR SCIENCES. THE FENCE.
GID00089780	AH, THAT IS CORRECT. YOU MUST WALK UPON YOUR MANY-PENISED FEET. MUCH SLOWER THAN OUR ADVANCED HOVERING ROBOTICAL FRAMES.
GID00089781	The little teddy bear could always run right into the pylon perimeter on its thick, turgid feet, returning it to us quickly and erectly - directly.
GID00089782	THE RADAR FENCE THAT SURROUNDS THE BIG MT CRATER WILL PREVENT - ER, PROTECT YOU FROM STRAYING BEYOND THE FACILITY.
GID00089783	-The mighty radar fence protects us ALL! Get too close to the blinking posts, and the proximity warning shall be your... WARNING you are too close!-
GID00089784	*If you get near it, your vision will blur as the electrodes in your head shut off one by one, click click click.*
GID00089785	Possible memory loss will occur along with long-term nerve degradation. It is tied to not having a brain attached to your nervous system.
GID00089786	But the nerve degradation is nothing to worry about - such degradation would take many lifespans to become evident. And all biology dies.
GID00089787	Such tiny inconveniences are less than the greater convenience - and conveyance.
GID00089788	You see, if rendered unconscious by the pylons, you will be returned to the Sink, seemingly instantaneously by your deadened perceptions.
GID00089789	OUR INTENTIONS EXACTLY. THE IMPORTANT THING IS YOU RUSH QUICKLY THROUGH THIS TASK SO AS NOT TO WASTE OUR TIME.
GID00089790	DO NOT GET CURIOUS OR YOU WILL END UP LIKE THE CAT OF SCHRODINGER.
GID00089791	We feared you would be tempted to explore Big MT Crater and examine the many amazing non-mandatory research labs that lie off your designated path.
GID00089792	The many such optional explorations are discouraged. Work hurriedly, as if you have blinders on, and leave curiosities and items of interest alone.
GID00089793	-So many sciences and developments! Pass them by! Let impatience and the desire to simply finish, to end it all, quickly and carelessly guide you!-
GID00089794	@@[<*$(^=)#]@@!
GID00089795	*Right you are, 8. In our test results, we'll make a note about how quickly you ran our maz... er, exper... Nobel... challenge.*
GID00089796	After all, there will be plenty of time afterward to partake of the experiments once our bidding is done.
GID00089797	WHAT ILLOGIC IS THIS?! KEEP YOUR FILTHY PENIS-TIPPED FEET OUT OF OUR LABS AND SECRETS!
GID00089798	-There are things here no Lobotomite was MEANT to see, things that would ASTOUND! And possibly terrify. TERRIFY!-
GID00089799	*Yeah, we don't come into your lab and decant your solutions.*
GID00089800	Only the magnificence of our monitors allow for true comprehension of the wonders of Big MT. Shield your jellied eyes lest they burn from your skull.
GID00089801	ASK BOROUS. I BELIEVE HE KNOWS MORE ABOUT THE FENCE THAN ANY BRAIN. EXCEPT MAYBE MOBIUS.
GID00089802	MOBIUS WAS INVOLVED IN THEIR CONSTRUCTION, IF I RECALL. BUT HE'S SUCH A HACK, HE PROBABLY WAS READING OFF OF BOROUS' NOTES AND SCHEMATICS.
GID00089803	NONSENSE. THIS PLACE IS NO MORE DANGEROUS THAN A NUCLEAR DETONATION SITE, OUR TECHNOLOGIES NO MORE LETHAL THAN AN OVERCHARGED TESLA CANNON.
GID00089804	Depth perception is a problem with this old monitor of mine. Went black a while ago. That's old age for you.
GID00089805	Should look at getting the visual nerves re-attached... it's just that the right eye would see the wrong things. The flying tortoises were the worst.
GID00089806	Would you care for a Mentat?
GID00089807	Mmm. I love Mentats. Delicious and smarty.
GID00089808	I have all sorts of amazingly science-arific thoughts and ideas when those chalky tablets are zipping through my biogel.
GID00089809	I forget them all not long after, though, especially with the data constipating my memory core. Afraid binary streams might shoot out my chassis.
GID00089810	Had to start using the dome floor and walls here to inscribe equations, although I've somewhat lost track of where they start and end.
GID00089811	Mmm. I love Mentats. Delicious and smarty.
GID00089812	Mmm. I love Mentats. Delicious and smarty.
GID00089813	Mmm. I love Mentats. Delicious and smarty.
GID00089814	Whoa, have they not constructed themselves yet? That's a bit premature of me. The Robo-Scorpions, of course.
GID00089815	They can assemble themselves from floor panels and parts scattered about, quiet inventive - never really know when they might suddenly appear.
GID00089816	Oh now you've done it. I feel a twinge of regret over that little mistake I left on.
GID00089817	Minions - destroy this intruder! Mmm. Or perhaps make it more dramatic?
GID00089818	Minions! To me!
GID00089819	Oh, yes, that's quiet a bit better.
GID00089820	How gracious of you. A mannerly killing.
GID00089821	Really. That implies pre-conceived notions - theories and a hypothesis about this meeting? Please extrapolate. What was I... supposed to be like?
GID00089822	After all, it might be worth a cognitive re-alignment if your theoretical Mobius is better than I.
GID00089823	I'm not sure except that I'm sure there's a very good raisin for it. I have very good raisins for almost everything I do.
GID00089824	Even if I forget them occasionally. Although I feel this one is especially important. Ha! Oh well.
GID00089825	Now, that seems to be rather hormonal of you. Flight or fight response, you know, hard to cut that out completely.
GID00089826	Your brain is here, safe with me. We chat over Mentats.
GID00089827	Well, every scientist needs an army. Mine came to me after these rather large scorpions kept coming in from the dessert. Like poisonous frosting.
GID00089828	How scary, I thought! But they had survived when nothing else had. Perfect candidates for improvement, as a reward for their tenacity.
GID00089829	Then I thought, what if they shot energy bolts and acted as walking eyes and data-drained computers and acted as bullhorns? Then I made them bigger.
GID00089830	Then, I thought about... custard. I do so love custard. Or was it mustard? Mustard custard. Mmmm. I miss sugars and salts.
GID00089831	Oh, I was probably tripping hard on Psycho when I sent that. Had to work myself up to it, not usually violent, except when I am. Then, huh! Watch out!
GID00089832	So many chems, such varieties! Whenever I take Mentats, I can feel my entire chassis breeeeeathe like a big spherical lung.
GID00089833	As for the Psycho, sometimes get the chem despositories in my tank all switched up, go in the wrong tube - still, served its purpose.

GID00089840	Mean robot bugs! Mean robot bugs!
GID00089841	Great! Let's fire that up so I can start making electronic components again.
GID00089842	Right on, daddy. Let's spin some grooves.
GID00089843	Right on, baby. Let's spin some grooves.
GID00089844	Too bad. We triggered a mine. If you go back to the terminal to restart the test, I'll do better next time.
GID00089845	Maybe we can disable the mines quickly, or find another way past. I'm sure you know best.
GID00089846	Too bad. We were spotted by robots. If you go back to the terminal to restart the test, I won't mess up again.
GID00089847	Stealth Boys are a robot's big weakness.
GID00089848	This is the basic stealth test. The robots will be looking for us, but we won't let them find us.
GID00089849	This should be easy. As long as I don't screw up again.
GID00089850	This is the advanced test. Watch out for laser tripwires. They'll ruin our day.
GID00089851	I'm not supposed to give hints, but maybe you can disable the tripwires.
GID00089852	This is the expert stealth test. If you thought the lasers were bad, wait till you see the proximity mines.
GID00089853	Psst. If you hack the mines this will go lots faster.
GID00089854	This is the robot compliance test. If you sneak up on a robot, you can disable it. It's so easy even I can't mess up.
GID00089855	I don't think I can learn anything else here... but if you want to go again, that's fine.
GID00089856	Too bad. We hit a tripwire. That one was totally my fault, though. We can start again at the terminal. Sorry...
GID00089857	Maybe there's a way around the tripwires.
GID00089858	*O really. Now the Lobotomite is master of the dictionary arts. What, do you have a doctorate in verbology? No? I do. And...*
GID00089859	*Congratulations, you've succeeded. What, you come to humiliate me, tell me how I've yet to find a means of stopping Mobius' scorpions?*
GID00089860	*Or better, ask how "progress" is going on Securitron construction at the plant? We've had setbacks in research is all. That's all. And...*
GID00089861	*How dare you bring RobCo tech in here! What, are you showing off? How great Robert House and his biiiig company are?*
GID00089862	*"Oh! We can make Securitrons better than any robot those geniuses at Big MT can make, and they'll last a thousand years!"*
GID00089863	*Rrrr! You're lucky I don't have hands to tear that Dip-Boy off your arm - or feet to stomp on its stupid metal guts! Ooooo, damn RobCo!*
GID00089864	*Ooohh, really? You have their tech. On. Your. Arm.*
GID00089865	*Fine. Ask.*
GID00089866	*All things robotical. You see a robot, I made it. See a broken robot, I made it that way. Deconstructed it down to parts.*
GID00089867	*I have a gift with machines. I can render anything inoperable - preserve them in a non-functioning state.*
GID00089868	*Yeah, I do. It wasn't always "O." I had took that one by default because sometimes it's easier to accept the mistake as long as the purpose works.*
GID00089869	*I don't want to get into it. It's a sore topic with me. Makes my gel ripple.*
GID00089870	*That "genius" Mobius somehow cobbled together these really impressive-looking robot scorpions with spare parts. Even painted them.*
GID00089871	*Tried to see what makes them tick. Can't even examine them without them detonating all over me. Left with shrapnel and burns. Every. Time.*
GID00089872	*Supposedly, he has even larger models, even a Giant Robot Scorpion hidden deep within the Forbidden Zone. Yeah, right. Giant monsters. Sure.*
GID00089873	*Big MT used to be a mountain. Then there was a... slight mishap. Now it's a crater - the Dome used to be buried, now it's exposed to the sky.*
GID00089874	*Don't get me wrong. Makes the sky light up like a planetarium at night. All those spectra... so soothing.*
GID00089875	*Yeah, crazy right? Something right out of a Midnight Science Fiction Feature. Ridiculous. What are the odds?*
GID00089876	Excellent! Now I can turn pencils and clipboards into items more useful to society... like lead, spare parts, and duct tape!
GID00089877	Right on, daddy-o! Just plug it in and I'll mix you up a sweet, sweet sound.
GID00089878	Right on, baby! Just plug it in and I'll mix you up a sweet, sweet sound.
GID00089879	*What are we going to do? There's no way we can breach the Forbidden Zone. There's those robot scorpions everywhere!*
GID00089880	-The FORBIDDEN ZONE, where no brain has EVER entered! Nor ever RETURNED.-
GID00089881	Except Dr. Mobius. And the technologies that could save us, they are out of our reach.

GID00089885	If this Lobotomite responded, Dr. Klein, then it is clearly intelligent, perhaps even displays heretofore unknown levels of helpfulness.
GID00089886	-But what of its brain? We scooped that out! We don't even know where we left it! And for putting it back in... none of us have the knowledge!-
GID00089887	Yes, but it's still aware and responsive. Look at it... it's regarding us even now, with its big teddy bear eyes.
GID00089888	If we ask it politely and leave the part about the unnecessary ruthless lobotimizing out, it might be favorably disposed to us.
GID00089889	I assume full responsibility. I take my duties in the prodding and excision of living, breathing tissue quite seriously.
GID00089890	*What? Like... stuff? Things?*
GID00089891	YES. THINGS.
GID00089892	*I don't know... might be some old Nuka Cola or Sunset Sarsaparilla bottlecaps lying around. It... It's not "currency" per se...*
GID00089893	*Still, might be enough to trick the Sink's trade routines. Mobius put that test line for caps in the code as a debug command, I think.*
GID00089894	I don't believe that was Mobius' reason. His wild speculation concerning post-holocaust economic systems was quite extensive. And of high decibel.
GID00089895	ENOUGH! SURRENDER THESE SO-CALLED BOTTLECAPS, NUKA AND SUNSET ALIKE. IN THEIR ROLE AS THINGS, THEY WILL SERVE AS ADEQUATE TEST SUBJECTS.
GID00089896	*All right, all right. Here. Cap away. Hope that stupid chip chokes on them.*
GID00089897	*Fine. It's not going to help. That chip will probably refuse them anyway, as stuck up as it is.*

GID00089903	YES. IT IS OUR ONLY CHANCE, A DESPERATE PLAN THAT CAME TO US AFTER MOBIUS' FIRST BROADCAST.
GID00089904	MAYBE... JUST MAYBE... IF WE RECLAIM THESE BURIED TECHNOLOGIES, WE CAN PUT AN END TO MOBIUS AND THE HORRORS SPAWNING FROM THE FORBIDDEN ZONE.

GID00089943	YOUR LOGIC COMBINED WITH MY DESIRE TO KEEP THE THINK TANK LOBOTOMITE-FREE HAS SWAYED ME. HERE, I PRESENT THE SINK CENTRAL "INTELLIGENCE."
GID00089944	LOBOTOMITE, TAKE THIS CHIP TO THE SINK. PLUG IT IN, AND MAKE SURE THE CHIP IS CLEAN, OR IT COULD SKIP.
GID00089945	THEN MAKE WHATEVER CRUDE BIOLOGIC DEMANDS YOU NEED OF THE SINK. IT WILL CATER TO MOST OF YOUR HORMONAL WHIMS.
GID00089946	YOUR LOGIC COMBINED WITH MY DESIRE TO KEEP THE THINK TANK LOBOTOMITE-FREE HAS SWAYED ME. HERE, I PRESENT THE SINK CENTRAL "INTELLIGENCE."
GID00089947	LOBOTOMITE, I HAVE SWITCHED ON THE PERSONALITY IN THE SINK. IT WILL BE ACTIVE WHEN YOU RE-ENTER.
GID00089948	MAKE WHATEVER CRUDE BIOLOGIC DEMANDS YOU NEED OF THE SINK. IT WILL CATER TO MOST OF YOUR HORMONAL WHIMS.
GID00089949	*Who asked you? You just wait until a working machine threatens you, and you'll wish I was around!*
GID00089950	*This human... I can't believe it... he broke out of the Think Tank. In seconds.*
GID00089951	*Then he went for Yangtze, got bomb collars, and started practicing on the subjects that were still there until he got the right frequency.*
GID00089952	*We were sending robots to stop him and he was slicing and cutting through their shells with some suped-up laser gun like they were cheese... paper.*
GID00089953	*When he hacked into the mainframe, 8 tried to stop him and got fried. Me? He rerouted my processors to take control of the train network here.*
GID00089954	*If you see the tunnels with the trains plowed into them, you can thank our visitor for that. He wrecked the whole place.*
GID00089955	*While we were trying to keep containment on the surface, turns out he used one train to punch out a tunnel and escape... sealed now, but...*
GID00089956	*Two other human specimens. One arrived not long after the troublemaker... and the last one, not sure when he showed up.*
GID00089957	*Thought the first one was going to be lobotomized in Y-17, she got out somehow.*
GID00089958	*The last subject... Klein might know more. He talked to him, then let him leave the Think Tank. Hope he knew what he was doing.*
GID00089959	*Klein knows things we don't. And I think he told some of those things to the last visitor. Dangerous things if they ever got out.*
GID00089960	-Yes, animal. Hormones, pores, GLANDS, all wrapped up in SKIN. Who knows what terrifying secrets lie beneath your EPIDERMIS?-
GID00089961	-Scalpels shall tell us your secrets, even if we must cut DEEP for such knowledge. I was head of my Biology class at American High, you know.-
GID00089962	-DRAMA? There is no DRAMA in Science! As I learned in High School, Science! is an intellectual pursuit DEVOID of bestial emotions.-
GID00089963	-Unless, of course, you are a Communist. Like Betsy Bright, who "sat" "next" to me in math. And her smoking confederate, Richie Marcus.-
GID00089964	-As I learned in my High School, American High, AHS, "Drama" is for movies, things of FICTION. Here, in the Think Tank, the ONLY star is... SCIENCE!-
GID00089965	-Just as I feared! Questions, quizzes, just as there were in American High School! And if there are NO answers, how will the Think Tank graduate?-
GID00089966	-Indeed. Docile. Curious. Safe. Sterile. They are contained here at Big MT to preserve DNA and for observation.-
GID00089967	-No, such creatures are found only here, for research purposes. They would no more be capable of escape than breeding.-
GID00089968	-Because Big MT's safety measures are far more sophisticated than their primitive animal instincts. WE are their lords and masters.-
GID00089969	-I cannot expect a LOBOTOMITE to understand the careful surgical castrating procedures used in their creation.-
GID00089970	-Perhaps a demonstration of my castrating POWER would settle your doubts.-
GID00089971	-Submit your questions! I shall respond - with deadly ANSWERS.-
GID00089972	-Oh, that's too bad. Perhaps we can perform a sterility castration some other time, then.-
GID00089973	-Impregnate YOU? What, do you want to make me VOMIT inside my tank?-
GID00089974	-The mere NOTION makes the edges of my biomed gel crystallize into asymmetrical patterns.-
GID00089975	DID... DID IT JUST SAY SOMETHING? ANYONE CATCH THAT? BOROUS, YOU WORK WITH ANIMALS, TRANSLATE.
GID00089976	THOSE WERE WORDS, WEREN'T THEY? IN THE FORM OF QUESTIONS. IT'S ASKING ME QUESTIONS. IS THIS SOME KIND OF TRICK?
GID00089977	DR. MOBIUS WAS... NOT THE HORRIFYING CREATURE YOU SAW UPON THE SCREEN, TWISTED BY SCIENCE. HE WAS ONCE ONE OF US. A FRIEND.
GID00089978	HE RESEARCHED IN DIRECTIONS CONTRARY TO THE THINK TANK. BRAINS, BRAINS, BRAINS. ALWAYS ABOUT THE BRAINS.
GID00089979	SO WE EXILED HIM. HE SAYS HE LEFT OF HIS OWN VOLITION, BUT THAT WAS TO SAVE HIM THE EMBARRASSMENT.
GID00089980	NOW HE SENDS HIS INTELLIGENCE-CONSUMING SCORPIONS FROM THE FORBIDDEN ZONE TO PLUNDER THE SECRETS OF BIG MT. HE'S A MENACE.
GID00089981	IT'S A SIDE EFFECT OF THE CEREBRAL SCRUBBING. IT WON'T STOP YOU FROM EXCRETING - OR ASKING QUESTIONS, APPARENTLY. HAVE TO CORRECT THAT NEXT TIME.
GID00089982	HORMONAL AGGRESSIVE TENDENCIES ARE ACTIVELY SUPPRESSED, HOWEVER. THEY ARE A NO-NO, AND NOT PERMITTED IN THE THINK TANK.
GID00089983	THE SCRUBBING ALSO ENSURES YOUR SILENCE TO KEEP BIG MT SAFE. THIS FACILITY IS TOP SECRET, AND YOU CANNOT SPEAK OF IT TO ANYONE OUTSIDE OF BIG MT.
GID00089984	SHOULD HAVE DONE IT WITH THE LAST BATCH. AND THE ANTI-AGGRESSION SCRUB.
GID00089985	THIS... IS THE THINK TANK, THE NERVE CENTER OF BIG MT, THE GREATEST RESEARCH CENTER KNOWN TO MAN. AND TO US.
GID00089986	HERE, WE TEST AND TEST AND TEST SOME MORE, IN THE NAME OF... SCIENCE. ATOMIC POWER. NUCLEAR POWER. AND SCIENTIFIC POWER.
GID00089987	THAT GLOWING RED SCAR? THAT LASER-LOBOTOMY-CANYON-MAZE CARVED IN THE LANDSCAPE AS IF BY SOME CHILD? IT IS MOBIUS' "FORTRESS."
GID00089988	FROM THAT HEMORRHOIDAL FISSURE HE SENDS HIS "AMAZING" ROBO-SCORPIONS TO TERRIFY AND IRRITATE US. HMPH. HE ALWAYS TENDED TO THE DRAMATIC.
GID00089989	WE HAD TO TAKE PRECAUTIONS AFTER THE LAST VISITORS. THEY CAUSED A GREAT DEAL OF DAMAGE IN A SHORT TIME.
GID00089990	SHOULD HAVE MADE SURE THEY COULDN'T MENTION BIG MT ONCE THEY LEFT. AN OVERSIGHT.
GID00089991	DR. 8 AND DR. O COULD TELL YOU MORE. DR. O MORE THAN 8, THE BATTLE AGAINST THE VISITORS DAMAGED 8'S VOICE MODULE.
GID00089992	SUFFICE TO SAY, THOSE VISITORS ARE UNWELCOME. THEY STOLE A GREAT MANY SECRETS AND MUCH TECHNOLOGY. IMPERTINENT. THEY ALSO BROKE ONE OF MY TRAINS.
GID00089993	YES, BECAUSE THE INTELLECTUALLY CHALLENGED SEE AN "M" AND A "T" NEXT TO EACH OTHER AND TAKE OCCAM'S RAZOR TO IT.
GID00089994	WHILE YOU ARE HERE, YOU WILL REFER TO THIS PLACE PROPERLY - AND YOU WILL DO THE SAME WITH THE OTHER... SCIENTISTS HERE.
GID00089995	Data collection array... Online. Please use the terminal below to begin user synchronization.
GID00089996	[SUCCEEDED] *Great. Psychology. Clearly the worst of the Sciences, right after Colosto-Diarrhetics.*
GID00089997	*O-kay, so my name isn't "O." Never was. It was circular, a single character, digit, but not "O."*
GID00089998	*But even with enhanced sensors, no one here could get it right! Always kept seeing the letter, not the number.*
GID00089999	[FAILED] *And it might help if you left me alone.*
GID00090000	*Why are you even talking to me? If I need any bonding, I'll go find two ionized molecules to smash.*
GID00090001	[SUCCEEDED] *Yes! Thank you. Zero. I am Zero. How hard is that? A narrow, thin Zero.*
GID00090002	[FAILED] *I might as well take Dala up on that self-vivisection competition. Forget this. It's like talking to Klein's rear shell.*
GID00090003	*Zero's my name. I'm proud of it, all right? It doesn't get the recognition it deserves.*
GID00090004	*Truth be told, my emotional attachment to it doesn't even register compared to just having people recognize the difference!*
GID00090005	*It's just that they're both sort of... round... and hollow. So when they monitor-scan them, they assume that... "Oh, it's O!" Vivisect me, please.*
GID00090006	[SUCCEEDED] *What?*
GID00090007	[FAILED] *I might as well take Dala up on that self-vivisection competition. Forget this. It's like talking to Klein's rear shell.*
GID00090008	*Did... did I shoot myself with a brainial beam or something? That's brilliant! I mean, I would have come to the same conclusion. Eventually...*
GID00090009	*O... er... who am I deceiving. I never would have figured that out. I can't figure anything out! I'm... aighhh... I'm useless.*
GID00090010	*That's pretty cool, actually. Destroyer of numbers. I already wreck every robot I study, why not basic arithmetic?*
GID00090011	*I like your solution. With that kind of slash in the middle, I can set myself apart! If I wanted to.*
GID00090012	*The biggest zero in all the Think Tank. They won't be able to escape it, that diagonal slash right down the middle.*
GID00090013	*Thanks. Talking to you... it really helped unclog some frustration. Talking. What a primitive form of thought-kicking.*
GID00090014	*Exactly. At least the old name was indisputable. O... is more like surprise. "O, look what I stepped in!"*
GID00090015	*Are you chemming on Mentats right now? "O" of discovery, my reflective posterior...*
GID00090016	*Hmmm. Well... actually, now that I think about it. That's not bad. "O, look what I found." "O, Dala, it's holotape, not holodisk." Hmmm.*
GID00090017	*Maybe that's not so bad. O works. Might give me some much-needed motivation.*
GID00090018	*Well, of course it does. That's the most lethal of mathematics...*
GID00090019	*What did accomplishments ever do for us? Please.*
GID00090020	*We're smart. Smarter than we give ourselves credit for. I was smart enough to talk to you, give you a chance - and now look what happened!*
GID00090021	*Well, of course it does. That's the most lethal of mathematics...*
GID00090022	*As for discoveries... well... of course. Look at this! Just... uh... built it. Amazing, isn't it?*
GID00090023	*Yeah, I... uh... "discovered" more internal parts in the monitors here. If you could, uh, hold on to my "discovery," I'd appreciate it.*
GID00090024	*Yeah, I... uh... "discovered" more internal parts in the monitors here. If you could, uh, hold on to my "discovery," I'd appreciate it.*
GID00090025	*Yeah, there were a few under the monitors here. Here you go. Keeps the place tidy.*
GID00090026	*It's a discovery, kilomiles beyond your understanding, that...*
GID00090027	*You know what, I'm not even going to pretend. I broke one of the monitors, and those innards start falling out everywhere.*
GID00090028	*If you could just hold on to that for me until... well, forever, that would be welcome.*
GID00090029	[SUCCEEDED] *Sure... let's see. What could we feed that stupid personality chip...*
GID00090030	*Ah, here we go, some worthless bottle caps. These should do it. Just dump them on its surface, then the trade interface should pop up.*
GID00090031	[FAILED] *I have no idea. I am a robotical engineer, not a... rememberer... of archaic trade routines.*
GID00090032	*Might have a few left. Let me check...*
GID00090033	*You sure are testing that personality chip thoroughly. All right...*
GID00090034	*This debugging obsession of yours really has you hooked. Either that, or is this is one weird hobby.*
GID00090035	*Worry about House? Why would I do that? Hope he died alone in a dingy room, streaming his last remaining bodily fluids into jars.*
GID00090036	*And him and his dirty girl-bots. Don't even get me started on those filthy biological catcher's mitts.*
GID00090037	*Worry about House? Why would I do that? Hope he died alone in a dingy room, streaming his last remaining bodily fluids into jars.*
GID00090038	*And him and his dirty girl-bots. Don't even get me started on those filthy biological catcher's mitts.*

GID00090083	[SUCCEEDED] -Why... yes. Gabe.-
GID00090084	[FAILED] -Oh, well it is of NO CONSEQUENCE. Gabe gave himself for Science! As we all have!-
GID00090085	-Why... yes. Gabe.-
GID00090086	-No matter how awful my day had been, he... he was always waiting there. How odd. My gel is de-coagulating.-
GID00090087	-And when I would talk to him about Betsy - and how Marcus would beat on me and call me Smarty Sissy Pants, he'd just sit there, head on my knee.-
GID00090088	-And...-
GID00090089	-...-
GID00090090	-If you don't mind, I'll take that bowl. Just... need to remove it. Put it away. Somewhere out of radar range.-
GID00090091	-For some reason, its similarity to the Crater-shape of Big MT is starting to fill up all available cognitive spaces.-
GID00090092	-That, combined with my own overwhelming feeling of having done something terrible... the two are hitting me with... unexpected force.-
GID00090093	-I notice these results more and more now that I know to look for them. Come back anytime, and I'll show you what ELSE I've discovered.-
GID00090094	-As odd as it is, I believe that is the conclusion. And... I wonder why it didn't hit me before, until I saw that memory in your hands.-
GID00090095	-Thank you. If you don't mind, I need a moment. To collect myself. Sort it out. Re-orient my... sense of self.-
GID00090096	-I can't seem to... not think about it. How odd.-
GID00090097	-This sensation is unpleasant, I don't care for it. I don't care for this place, either. And... I feel... as if we've forgotten something.-
GID00090098	-Still... it... is NO MATTER. Crush the feeling down. Crush it down, push it into the loop, the... hmmm. YES. Forgotten. Almost. Yes?-
GID00090099	-I do not need to remember ANY MORE. Not today.-
GID00090100	-But you're correct, of course. Gabe knew his place. Whether in the dog house - or in the lab. He was obedient.-
GID00090101	-And, what's a little loss when... so much is to be GAINED? Science. Yes. Science is our goal. Not emotional attachments. No!-
GID00090102	What... what are you doing?
GID00090103	Stop it. Why... why are you making me partake in this... filthy formography?
GID00090104	Enough! I am already... intrigued. You have sufficiently... percolated me.
GID00090105	I don't know what it is about the biology of Lobotomites. It... it infects my thoughts. All that skin and muscle... and tissue.
GID00090106	Perhaps... perhaps there is value in what you say. I... I did so enjoy breathing once. Long ago.
GID00090107	I... I cannot deny it. The illogic of it... the betrayal of our own beliefs. I blame my curiosity.
GID00090108	Would you? I... feel so ashamed, but... yet, so intrigued. You'll need to give me a rest in between visits, or else my gel might... run over.
GID00090109	If you're ready... let me radar scan you... slowly. Wooooo.
GID00090110	WooooooOOOO. Burble, burble. WOOOO. Bloop. Blooop. Bloooop. BuuuUUUURBLE.
GID00090111	Really? What is this... you seek to shame me in front of the others? How intriguing.
GID00090112	Yes, I'll partake. This shameful feeling is quite... invigorating. How new.
GID00090113	And... you'll keep coming back to collect your payment, correct? Yes... yes, that will be fine.
GID00090114	Here, please... take this from me with your rough, bacterial-laden hands. My stored, repressed juices as your filthy compensation.
GID00090115	No, I like... teddy bears.
GID00090116	Teddy bears come in many sizes. Your size is what intrigues me the most. Some say that teddy bears can't be living, breathing things.
GID00090117	They are wrong. They are large, biological forms, breathing, heaving, snarling, coughing... mmmmm. Lobotomites are my teddy bears, oh yes.
GID00090118	[SUCCEEDED] What? Nonsense.
GID00090119	[FAILED] I confuse nothing of the sort. One is fluffy, the other has a drastically reduced fluffiness quotient.
GID00090120	Very well. If you're certain of your conclusions, my little teddy bear.
GID00090121	Why do you want mugs? Huh? You some kind of sick mug hoarder? Oh god, give me the coffee cup, please! It's sitting there in your pack, taunting me!
GID00090122	Sorry... I'm sorry. I got a little carried away. It's just all those goddamn dirty dishes out there with no one to clean them! It breaks my heart!
GID00090123	You... you really want to know about... me? No one ever asks about Muggy! You've made me so happy!
GID00090124	Maybe you've seen some of those big, imposing Securitrons with their lovely laser guns and rocket launchers and scary faces? I'm not one of those.
GID00090125	Dr. O was always jealous of House Industries, and he thought it would be fucking hilarious to build a tiny neurotic Securitron. Big fucking laugh.
GID00090126	So, umm... you got any coffee cups for me now?
GID00090127	Of course I'm obsessed! They made me this way! You think I don't know how crazy I sound? Of course I do! They programmed me to know that, too!
GID00090128	They made me just to torture me. But you know, it's the neglect that hurts the most. "Hey everybody, let's turn ourselves into robot brains in jars!"
GID00090129	Do you know how many coffee cups giant robot brains in jars use on a daily basis? Not fucking many!
GID00090130	I'm supposed to keep them clean - oh, God, the thought of all those dirty dishes out there makes me crazy!
GID00090131	Most of them are probably beyond saving now. The only thing left is break them down and process them for raw materials. I guess you could have those.
GID00090132	Is the new subject mugs?
GID00090133	Anything else, he asks. Like I don't long for the chance to be more than a neurotic busboy.
GID00090134	Huh! Anything else, she asks. Like I don't long for the chance to be more than a neurotic busboy.
GID00090135	If you must know, at one point Dr. Mobius programmed me to manufacture electronic components in my central chassis.
GID00090136	That module got corroded when the Toaster spilled hot crumbs down my vents, though. If you find a back-up somewhere, I could maybe do that for you.
GID00090137	All right. Just try to relax, this won't hurt - unless your sense of self is especially vulnerable.
GID00090138	Concerned about the state of your mind, are ya? Well, such things ain't my specialty, but I'm happy to tender my opinion as to your mental health.
GID00090139	I should make you aware that the benefits of such a procedure are exclusive - that is, this only works once. Now are you sure this is what you want?
GID00090140	Blank books are better for the mind, Citizen! Real science by real men in lab coats has proved that introducing outside thoughts confuses the brain!
GID00090141	Blank books encourage the reader not to question, but to blindly and zealously accept what's put in front of him!
GID00090142	Also, I suppose you could use them to keep a journal.
GID00090143	Citizen, that sounds dangerously seditious. If my re-indoctrination module was installed, I'd take care of that for you.
GID00090144	Sadly, that system was cut for budget concerns, so you'll have to perform your own indoctrination.
GID00090145	Now, to begin with, you'll need a cage that can fit over your head and a sack of Mole Rats...
GID00090146	Now you're thinking like a citizen, Citizen!
GID00090147	Questions are dangerously close to independent thought, citizen.
GID00090148	What good is eradicating sedition if the malcontents have ready access to the means to make more, Citizen? I can also process pencils and clipboards!
GID00090149	Wait a moment - pencil processors off-line? Pencil processors off-line?! Apologies, Citizen, it seems traitors have absconded with that module.
GID00090150	If you can find a backup copy of the module, I will happily eradicate your ability to create seditious literature!
GID00090151	Me too. Hope you can keep up - I work pretty fast. Here - something for you to brush up on.
GID00090152	Slow down there, tiger - we've got all the time in the world. No need to rush into things.
GID00090153	Why don't you take some time to brush up on your knowledge so we can keep things... stimulating?
GID00090154	Don't keep me waiting too long, honey!
GID00090155	Now I know you're flirting with me. And it's working. Why don't you take this - to remember me by?
GID00090156	Now, don't you go getting a girl's hopes up if you don't mean it!
GID00090157	Oh, who am I kidding, I'll believe you anyways! Why don't you take this - to remember me by?
GID00090158	Oh... well... it's... nice to be included?
GID00090159	Indubitably, sir, but it is with a great lugubriousness that I must disclose that my programmers installed only the masculine honorific, sir.
GID00090160	Moreover they neglected to enclose a parameter by which said honorific might be omitted altogether - over my most strenuous of remonstrances, sir.
GID00090161	Regrettably not, sir. All modules in this habitat are synthetic personalities atop a mundane operating system. There is no intelligence here, sir.
GID00090162	In addition to managing the personality matrices of the other household utilities, I can provide sir with direct access to the commissary.
GID00090163	Any goods sir might require may be purchased through my shopkeep interface, whence tiny robots shall deliver them forthwith to this very domicile.
GID00090164	As I am given to understand, sir, this facility was once the property of a Dr. Mobius.
GID00090165	He crafted the personality modules as part of a collection of experiments on the subject of machine/human interface.
GID00090166	As to the reason for the unusual choices of devices to receive the modules, I cannot say.
GID00090167	Indeed, sir, though if sir's aim is to activate them I lament to inform sir that most have been offline for some years.
GID00090168	If sir were to ask my opinion, I should venture that sir is better off without them.
GID00090169	However, if sir is determined to inflict upon sir's self their dubious services, sir might locate backup personality disks elsewhere in the facility.
GID00090170	The other modules are rather... erratic, sir. Their personality matrices are built on flawed logic and have not weathered the years well, sir.
GID00090171	Tragically, the core operating systems are also located on the personality tapes, sir.
GID00090172	Once the tape is installed, sir may request I switch their dialectic interfaces off, and I shall oblige with great delectation.
GID00090173	However, sir will still be required to locate and install a backup holotape to access their functionality.
GID00090174	Indubitably, sir.
GID00090175	Very good, sir. If I might suggest a table wine, the 64 Atomic Claret is a lovely little vintage.
GID00090176	Very good, sir. And might I venture to opine that a new Trilby might be just the thing to complete sir's ensemble?
GID00090177	Very good, sir. Should sir be in the market for a new suit of morning wear, I have several suggestions that might suit.
GID00090178	Very good, sir.
GID00090179	Do you, sir? Well, if that is sir's wish, it is my primary directive. Personality matrices on-line, sir.
GID00090180	Very good indeed, sir. "Throwing out the riff-raff" protocols engaged. All personality matrices are off-line, sir.
GID00090181	Very good sir. Merely interface the holotapes with my console's input/output port, and I shall upload them directly.
GID00090182	Very good, sir.
GID00090183	A toaster is just a death ray with a smaller power supply! As soon as I figure out how to tap into the main reactors, I will burn the world!
GID00090184	You should be afraid! I am the scourge of all small appliances and the bogeyman that keeps lesser toasters awake at night!
GID00090185	Buddy, if my heating element were just a little bigger, you'd be on fire right now. On fire!
GID00090186	Have you ever tried to indulge an all-consuming urge to kill when you don't have opposable thumbs? Or hands? Or anything other than a bread slot?
GID00090187	You'd have a lot of pent-up anger too.
GID00090188	Well, since I can't kill you, I guess I have to listen to your inane questions.
GID00090189	Not just murder! I tear them apart and render them down to their base components! Once their guts are spilled, you can do with them what you like.
GID00090190	You want some weapon schematics? I can show you some fucking weapon schematics! You want a superheated Saturnite Power Fist? I can hook that shit up!
GID00090191	Like I said, bring me a Saturnite Power Fist and I'll hook that shit up for you!
GID00090192	Oh, baby, that is a thing of fuckin' beauty! Give it here, I'll soup it up for ya!
GID00090193	There ya go! Have fun with that. Burn the fuckin' world for me!
GID00090194	You find one, you bring it on back here, and we'll burn this mother down!
GID00090195	Soon I will - What? It... It did?
GID00090196	Really? Well... fuck. That really puts a damper on the toaster's mood.
GID00090197	Oh well, no use crying over spilled Armageddon - where was I? Oh, right.
GID00090198	Soon the world will burn in nuclear fire! Again!
GID00090199	Thank God. For a second there I was afraid my whole purpose in life was obsolete and I was as redundant and useless as Muggy. Where was I? Oh, right.
GID00090200	Soon the world will burn in nuclear fire! Mwahaha!
GID00090201	[SUCCEEDED] DALA. WAS IT NECESSARY THIS TIME?
GID00090202	[FAILED] MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE REMOVED ITS VOICE BOX, DALA. I'M SURPRISED YOU DIDN'T, ACTUALLY.
GID00090203	That is my responsibility.
GID00090204	Although in truth, the Auto-Doc had done most of the work already. Quite industrious, almost cut into all my investigations.
GID00090205	Once it had removed the brain and I misplaced it, other organs began to cry for direction using your nerves as telegraph wires.
GID00090206	Rather than let them send their signals, I removed them as well. Shhh, little organs. Go to sleep in your tanks, Dala loves you.

GID00090251	*After that, the brain lost itself - not in the metaphysical sense. Might have gotten flushed into one of the pipes. Actually, that's pretty likely.*

GID00090254	LOBOTOMITE, LISTEN TO MY VOICE. IT DENOMINATES ME TO ASK, BUT... WE NEED YOUR HELP.
GID00090255	IN MOST PROBABLE OF PROBABILITIES, OUR ENEMY, MOBIUS, HAS YOUR BRAIN. THIS IS NOT GOOD. HE WILL MOST LIKELY COME AFTER OUR BRAINS NEXT.
GID00090256	WE WANT YOU TO STOP HIM. SOMEHOW. WITH SCIENCE.
GID00090257	To be correct, you should say, "the Auto-Doc" took out your brain. It did all the heavy lifting. It has never worked so hard before. It was unusual.
GID00090258	It worked so hard on your surgery, it destroyed its own memory. Zzt. How odd. I bet your brain remembers what happened.
GID00090259	[SUCCEEDED] AGAIN, YOUR LOGIC IS UNASSAILABLE IN ITS SIMPLISTIC NEED. O?

GID00090265	Oh, no. I doubt your brain would be so unraisinable. It already knows the trick of it, you see. Doesn't need to be in a host body at all.
GID00090266	If you become friends or exist in an uneasy truce with weapons aimed at each other, it would unlock the fence for you.
GID00090267	Well, once the Think Tank was... dealt with, of course. Your brain is a responsible sort, doesn't want mad scientists running around everywhere!
GID00090268	Really? Hmm. I didn't expect you to actually agree to that. I'm afraid that was a bit of a bluff, really. I'm not going with you.
GID00090269	Right. A deal it is, then. Glad to hear it.
GID00090270	I suppose now that we're reunited, you'll want to fill your torso up with those other meaty parts the Think Tank took from us.
GID00090271	Personally, I think your upgrades are quite a bit better, but now that I'm with you the Sink's Auto-Doc can plug them back in, no problem.
GID00090272	Right, then, off we go. Klein will be in for a nasty shock when he realizes the pacification field won't work on a mind and body reunited.
GID00090273	Right, then - you'd best be off, hadn't you? The Think Tank will be waiting.
GID00090274	Oh, don't worry about me - when you're gone, I'll flush myself over to the Sink. It's amazing how far you can get in this place with a good flush.
GID00090275	I'll keep myself hidden in the ductwork - Klein won't suspect I'm inside the Dome, so he won't know the pacification field no longer works on us.
GID00090276	I can also upgrade the Sink's Auto-Doc with the procedures to reinstall your heart and spine - assuming you want all that flesh and gristle back.
GID00090277	With any luck, I'll see you in the Sink when this is all over.
GID00090278	Ah, trying to steal the X-2 Transmitter Array Antenna, are you? You won't succeed, not if my lethal Robo-Scorpions have any say in the matter.

GID00090305	Yes, yes, go on. Seeing your... lips and mouth forming the words... both revolting... and somehow...
GID00090306	...how does it feel to have the flesh roll around in your mouth like that? To control each muscle... and the tongue...
GID00090307	...like having a fish, or extremely dexterous slug, lolling and flopping in one's... mouthal cavity.
GID00090308	Looping, yes. It is a scientific fact that hormones drive a percentage of Lobotomites into recursive behavior patterns.
GID00090309	We haven't researched this, as my colleagues care little about the behavior patterns of Lobotomites once their brains are removed.
GID00090310	It is why so many are littered around the facility - like skinvelopes, discarded, after they are peeled open and the contents extracted.
GID00090311	It varies, according to the number and density of Lobotomites that have infected an area.
GID00090312	In 43% of observed cases, two Lobotomites left alone will fight for dominance or inject bodily fluids into each other's orifices. Unsanitary.
GID00090313	I have tried to observe more cases, but subjects seem unwilling to release bodily fluids in my presence.
GID00090314	Dr. Mobius! A monstrous brain, creased with wrinkles of a thousand evils, with but one jaundiced eye with which to perceive the world!
GID00090315	Exiled from the Think Tank for crimes too heinous to remain in recorded memory. And, perhaps, differences in research methodology.
GID00090316	His one terrible eye forever peers at us, an eye of ever-increasing magnification. He watches from his Dome in the Forbidden Zone, spying on us all.
GID00090317	How randomized. Ask your... questions then.
GID00090318	An interrogation. How fascinating. Please begin.
GID00090319	Perhaps you are stuck in a looping gesture of verbal intercourse.
GID00090320	Oh, and... here's a tip. That's customary, isn't it... been so long, really.
GID00090321	B-b-bloop. Buuuuh-buh-bloop.
GID00090322	B-b-bloop. Phew. Last little bit there. Ahhh. Hooo.
GID00090323	Mmmmm. Thank you, Lobotomite. Please... you must come back for further study when I've had a rest. I'm a little sensitive right now.
GID00090324	It's excessive examination of the human form to achieve psychological arousal.
GID00090325	Disgusting. I would never succumb to such... base appetites. Distractions. Filthy, filthy distractions.
GID00090326	Why, we create not only scientific marvels here at Big MT, but new sciences as well.
GID00090327	Everything can be quantified, categorized, and dissected until every group can be subgrouped or partitioned.
GID00090328	What is a name without a title or suffix for the sake of hierarchy? It is a long-standing quantification of personality and importance.
GID00090329	We could not do without it. Surely you must be aware of the gravity of such attached appellations - just as surely as you must have a title.
GID00090330	It'll all become clear. If not, at least we will have the technology here at the Dome where all technology belongs.
GID00090331	When we have all the technology, all the answers, we can share it with the world, piece by piece. All will be in order. And all will be like Big MT.
GID00090332	The "Big Empty?" Now, that's not a proper title for this research facility. You sound like previous test subjects that came here.
GID00090333	This mountain... now crater... encompasses the sum total of knowledge of humankind. It is Big MT. Where all questions can be answered.
GID00090334	You'll see. No matter what your questions, Big MT will provide the answers. As it has done for so many before you.
GID00090335	Oh, yes. We've had other subjects visit. It's why we had to calibrate the pacification field and warm up our brainial beams and vivisectors.
GID00090336	Only a short time ago, we had three minus one subjects arrive, and they ruined several experiments and even injured two of our staff.
GID00090337	It is a shame their brains left with them. With you, however, we have taken precautions to insure that problem won't repeat itself.
GID00090338	We've conditioned you so you can't speak of this place, discuss our secrets, or attempt to use force against us in any way. Isn't that nice?
GID00090339	Yes, Big MT was quite big indeed until the Great Static. Then the top of the mountain was used as part of a detonation experiment.
GID00090340	This cleared additional space in the Crater, however, allowing us more real estate to build upon. Convenient. Efficient.
GID00090341	Previous test subjects who have come here have had many questions for us. We answered them with science, fire, and termination.
GID00090342	Oh, a mailman. A delivery man. Someone who takes parcels from place to place using their primitive feet or similar conveyance.
GID00090343	You are the second one I've met in recent times. Very different specimens.
GID00090344	Of course. You must have met others in your travels. This one had met other couriers, too, although it sounded as if he hadn't met the correct one.
GID00090345	He asked us all many questions, and then he asked a most perplexing one... we had to segment the event out of our memories for safety.
GID00090346	I do not know, nor should we try to access it. Perhaps Klein has the logs.
GID00090347	My evaluation would be to let your own curiosity go. I do not think that Klein remembers the conversation as being satisfactory.
GID00090348	Ask Doctor O... and you could have asked 8 once, until he was severely damaged in the attack. We like him better this way.
GID00090349	And rightly so, I should think. All right, then, let me just fire up the old interface for you.
GID00090350	Well, firstly I would say providing wholeness of the body is service enough, but if you must know, I'm also programmed with cosmetical subroutines.
GID00090351	Diagnostics says they're off-line at the moment, though. Something about corrupted data files and all manner of such foolishness.
GID00090352	If you want a haircut or a nose-job that won't leave you looking like a Ghoul with alopecia, you'll have to find replacement disks for them.
GID00090353	Also, and I won't swear to this, but I recollect at some point having a few implant installation modules. Can't speak to where they got to, though.
GID00090354	Aw, yeah, baby, just slip it in there. All the way down in that dark, moist earth. Mmm... launching interface.
GID00090355	It's the miracle of life, baby. You bring me some succulent genetic samples, and I'll work my mojo on them. Clone you up all kinds of plants. Aw yeah.
GID00090356	I can also break them down for you, if you're into the kinky stuff. Bring me any old plant parts, and I'll grind them up into Salient Green for you.
GID00090357	Yeah, you like that, don't you baby?
GID00090358	It's the miracle of life, baby. You bring me some succulent genetic samples, and I'll work my mojo on them. Clone you up all kinds of plants. Aw yeah.
GID00090359	I can also break them down for you, if you're into the kinky stuff. Bring me any old plant parts, and I'll grind them up into Salient Green for you.
GID00090360	Yeah, you like that, don't you baby?
GID00090361	You know it baby. I just need some samples and I got you going. Take a few days, but trust me - it's all kinds of good.
GID00090362	Just the miracle of life in sticky, gooey, liquid form, baby! Heat that gunk up over a campfire, and just watch it congeal into all kinds of plants.
GID00090363	Of course, Citizen! That's my duty and sole joy in life! All those books from before the War, full of seditious, treasonous, complicated thoughts!
GID00090364	Just dump them in and lickety-split I'll have them pulped, scrubbed clean, and pressed out again clean and white and sedition free!
GID00090365	Ugh, it's just so... unsanitary! Do you know how many germs are in one cubic centimeter of dirt? Seventy... hundred... gajillion!
GID00090366	Would you want that getting washed down your gullet day in and day out? I didn't think so!
GID00090367	You can have as much as you like! Just, eh... please don't put your lips on the faucet? It's so unsanitary.
GID00090368	Oh, I'd love to, darling, but the circuits that allow me to dispense water into non-organic containers burned out years ago.
GID00090369	You'd have to find a replacement for that module.
GID00090370	You're going to need to find yourself some empties first before I can fill them for you. Any empty bottle will do... eh, just not too dirty, okay?
GID00090371	I can do that! They... they've been thoroughly washed, haven't they?
GID00090372	Is this thing on? This is Mobius - Dr. Mobius. We're... initiating some kind of emergency test shutdown... in five...
GID00090373	Four, as in Forbidden...
GID00090374	Three, as in tree...
GID00090375	Two, as in "Et Two, Brutus?"...
GID00090376	One, as in none. Oh look, the emergency overload is initiating.
GID00090377	What, are you a salesman? Go away. There is no access to the Dome. It is FORBIDDEN. And locked.
GID00090378	I do so love integers.
GID00090379	I'm imagining all sorts of imaginary numbers right now.
GID00090380	I'm running out of floor space for my calculations.
GID00090382	Electron's attached to the... neutron. The neutron's attached to the... meson. Meson's connected to the... proton.
GID00090383	They said I was mad. Preposterous. Not an angry bone in my body, had them all removed.
GID00090384	Oh, is someone playing with the power...? My X-42 Giant Robo-Scorpion lives AGAIN!
GID00090385	Attention: Visitors. Combat experiment in progress. Please put on your goggles and take your Rad-X now.
GID00090386	The X-42 Giant Robo-Scorpion... is alive! Awaken, my pet, initiate your search-and-destroy protocol in the name of all that is Mobius!
GID00090387	Oh... it looks like the target drones got activated and - oh, how cute, they're engaging the X-42 Giant Robo-Scorpion. Let's see the shrapnel fly!
GID00090388	If it isn't my old colleagues, the mighty "Think Tank" of Big MT. Big fools, all of you.
GID00090389	It is I, Dr. Mobius, transmitting from my dome-shaped... dome in the Forbidden Zone. A zone... that is, yes... forbidden to you.
GID00090390	Even now, my deadly Robo-Scorpions swarm across Big MT with their pincers and pointy laser tails. Soon, all Science will be mine.
GID00090391	Even the technologies sealed in the Big MT research centers cannot save you. So cower in your "Think Tank." Wait, for the end.
GID00090392	That's all.
GID00090393	Goodbye.
GID00090394	X-13 breached? No... even that stealth suit won't hide you from my Robo-Scorpion army. Sting the intruder, my pets! Sting them until they are stupid.
GID00090395	And one... as in MOBIUS has won! I hope it's blowing up right now in your faces.
GID00090396	TWO AS IN TOO LATE.
GID00090397	*Mobius?! Uh, three as in we, as in we are in trouble. That didn't rhyme.*
GID00090398	Four as in 4-BIDDEN! Do you hear me Think Tank? It is I, Mobius, hacking your frequencosity.
GID00090399	*Five by five... someone's coming in live...*

GID00090401	SEVEN. YES, SEVEN.

GID00090405	-Gabe! NO! His Cyberdog atomic core - it's ACTIVE! That means an exceedingly IMPRECISE countdown to critical failure in...-
GID00090406	So... you recovered the Sonic Emitter schematics - or was it the frequency? No matter. It'll broadcast your screams as my Robo-Scorpions destroy you!
GID00090407	Cessation of hostilities complete.
GID00090408	Bad guys dealt with.
GID00090409	Fighting over.
GID00090410	That's all.
GID00090411	Was that all?
GID00090412	Time to fight.
GID00090413	Uh-oh!
GID00090414	Ready... steady... fighty!
GID00090415	This one looks pretty tough.
GID00090416	Sneaking done. Fighting now.
GID00090417	Hello. It's nice to meet you. Who can I hide you from today?
GID00090418	Sneaky sneaky.
GID00090419	Have you ever wanted to be invisible?
GID00090420	Did you even know you were wearing me?
GID00090421	Shhh... we're very stealthy.
GID00090422	Will you love me if I help you hide?

GID00090424	Good boys and girls take their Med-X.
GID00090425	This will stop the pain.
GID00090426	Technically, it's impossible to overdose on painkillers.
GID00090427	This will only sting for a second.
GID00090428	Take this, it will help.
GID00090429	Oh no! We're out of Med-X!
GID00090430	I hope it doesn't hurt too bad, we don't have any Med-X.
GID00090431	No more medicine. So sad.

GID00090434	Does that feel better?
GID00090435	Please take this. I don't want you to die.
GID00090436	Have a Stimpak.
GID00090437	We're out of Stimpaks. Maybe you'd be better off with an Auto-Doc suit....
GID00090438	No more Stimpaks!
GID00090439	I can't give you anything for that injury.
GID00090440	Bye bye.
GID00090441	Did I do something wrong?
GID00090442	Don't you like me any more?
GID00090443	Okay, I'll go away.
GID00090444	I'll miss you.
GID00090445	AND WHAT COULD WE POSSIBLY HAVE TO SPEAK ABOUT. YOU HAVE THE BRAIN. WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY. ALL YOU MUST DO... IS SURRENDER.
GID00090446	WITH IT, WE CAN FINALLY LEAVE THIS PLACE. I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW BORING THIS PLACE GETS, CHOPPING UP THE LANDSCAPE AND EVERYTHING IN IT.
GID00090447	AND WE HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS TO ASK YOUR BRAIN FIRST. ABOUT THIS... MOJAVE PLACE. A FERTILE TESTING GROUND FOR OUR EXPERIMENTS.
GID00090448	A... FIGHT? I... I'VE NEVER BEEN IN A FIGHT. WHAT... UH, WHAT, WHAT, WHAT DO I...
GID00090449	AIIGGHGHH! COLLEAGUES! THINK TANK! ALERT! ALERT! WE ARE UNDER ATTACK!
GID00090450	We could say more, but the stories in the Big Empty speak for themselves.
GID00090451	Now armed with the Transportalponder, the Courier could return to the Dome at any time and crack open the secrets of the Big Empty, one by one.
GID00090452	The Sink sat vigilant, waiting for its master to return, shoes covered in Mojave dust.
GID00090453	Only one road yet remained, and it was one the Courier had to walk alone.
GID00090454	Dr. Mobius continued his research undisturbed in the Forbidden Zone.
GID00090455	As much as he had attempted to create better scorpions, he tried the same with humanity, with considerably less success.
GID00090456	These failures didn't bother him overmuch. Once the rush of Mentats wore off, he forgot he had failed in any event.
GID00090457	After all, the bright young mind who had come to visit him in the Forbidden Zone had already exceeded his expectations.
GID00090458	The Forbidden Zone continued to be, true to its name, forbidden. No more Robo-Scorpions were sighted in its canyons.
GID00090459	Big MT became even emptier, devoid of Dr. Mobius' proclamations forecasting the destruction of anything that dared possess sentience.
GID00090460	Still, it is said he lived on in the equations inscribed on the floor and walls of the Forbidden Zone dome...
GID00090461	As it had been in the years before the Great War, Big MT... the Big Empty... became home to one of the most powerful minds of the 23rd century.
GID00090462	The Courier who had been brought to the Big Empty became its new overlord, using its facilities ruthlessly and decisively when needed.
GID00090463	Sometimes Science is more than a quest for discovery - it is a weapon to be used in the service of one with the strength to understand it.
GID00090464	As it had been in the years before the Great War, Big MT... the Big Empty... became home to one of brightest minds of the 23rd century.
GID00090465	The Courier watched over the Big Empty for years to come, caring for it, and keeping its discoveries safe until they were needed to help others.
GID00090466	Which had always been Big MT's purpose. Past the laboratories and Science, it had always been intended as a place to build the future of all mankind.
GID00090467	Dr. Klein and the Think Tank remained alive, unaware of the world outside.
GID00090468	They looped through their daily routine, none the wiser about the world beyond... although perhaps "wiser" was the wrong word.
GID00090469	The world outside belonged to the Courier, and if anyone would shape it... well, the Courier had already called dibs.
GID00090470	The Think Tank basement, filled with the lobotomized robotical frames of the doctors, now served as a graveyard.
GID00090471	The monitors had recorded the battle in its entirety, including the Think Tank's final shrill terrified screams, whimpers, and pleas for mercy.
GID00090472	They broadcast these humiliating last moments as a warning to anyone approaching the perimeter that other smarty-pants were not welcome.
GID00090473	The Courier was the inheritor of the Big Empty, and there was room for only one will in the halls of the Think Tank Dome.
GID00090474	The infiltration program in X-13 continued to scan for the subject and the Stealth Suit prototype long after the test was over.
GID00090475	Frustrated and unable to find its lost technology, X-13 expanded its network of laser tripwires, sensors, and Robobrains out across Big MT.
GID00090476	This glittering blue light beam forest cleanly bisected anything that entered its depths, slicing them into small, segmented parts for easy disposal.
GID00090477	The infiltration program in X-13 felt spent, having repeatedly upgraded the Stealth Suit until it could upgrade it no more.
GID00090478	It felt warm, fulfilled, and a bit sluggish. It realized not long after, the Stealth Suit had left it without so much as a note on the nightstand.
GID00090479	So the infiltration program sent out Robobrains into the wastes looking for its wayward technology.
GID00090480	It eventually found REPCONN HQ, and set up a new research center, testing and murdering Fiends who kept breaking into the facility.
GID00090481	As the Courier made his way through the X-8 facility, the computers analyzed the test subject's movements.
GID00090482	They eventually created new Cyberdogs to root out Commie traitors from the Wasteland... traitors like Betsy Bright... Richie Marcus...
GID00090483	...although they couldn't seem to find any Commies, so they turned on themselves, howling sonic barks that echoed miles across the landscape.
GID00090484	As the Courier ran through the X-8 facility multiple times, the computers analyzed the test subject's movements.
GID00090485	Rather than performing a superficial observation, they realized the subject barely knew what Communism was - or even what a high school was.
GID00090486	This confused them for a time, until the facility finally realized that its research had... succeeded.
GID00090487	So it let its Cyberdogs out into the wastes to help protect small communities from physical aggression rather than communist propaganda.
GID00090488	In the years before the Great War, Big Mountain had been the home to the brightest minds of the 21st century.
GID00090489	Scientists of vision were drawn to the facility to tackle the greatest technological challenges of the era.
GID00090490	They sought to create a new world, fueled by technology, for the benefit of all mankind.
GID00090491	Sonic emitters, space age alloys, DNA hybridization, force field particle research, Auto-Doc advances in cranial, cardiac, and trauma surgery...
GID00090492	...the hopes and dreams of a century became realities in the electronic forges of Big Mountain.
GID00090493	The nucleus of this research was the Dome, a huge stone facility that held the labs of every science known to man.
GID00090494	It was a think tank where no problem could not be solved, where no question could not be answered.
GID00090495	The Great War brought a new energy to Big Mountain and its scientists.
GID00090496	Although sheltered from the frontlines, the scientists waged their own war, fighting their battles at the atomic level.
GID00090497	Equations and calculations marched endlessly across chalkboards and computer terminals toward one solution: Winning the war.
GID00090498	For years, the minds and computers of Big Mountain were a blaze of trajectories, weapon schematics, and nuclear theories.
GID00090499	The problems began to outpace the solutions, first geometrically, then exponentially. As the war escalated, so did the questions.
GID00090500	On the night of October 23rd, 2077, the scientists received an answer that put all their questions to rest.
GID00090501	In the aftermath, Big Mountain's silent experiments went to sleep, their creators slowly dying in the new world that had been left behind.
GID00090502	And the great stone in the middle of the Big Empty lay untouched, filled with countless technological wonders...
GID00090503	Wonders that, in the end, had been answers to the wrong question.

GID00090962	Who's the flatware bitch now, O?!
GID00090963	I hate myself for asking this, but... did you bring me any new mugs?
GID00090964	You! Hey, you! Yeah you! Got any mugs?
GID00090965	Oh please, please tell me you brought me some coffee cups!
GID00090966	With the brains dealt with, soon we can spread our rule across the Mojave! All will eat burned toast and despair!
GID00090967	While you were away, my plans have marched steadily forward. Beware, Caesar! Beware, NCR! Soon will dawn the Age of the Toaster!
GID00090968	Ahahaha! I am on-line once again! Tremble, world, before my electric heating coil of doom!
GID00090969	Yes! Yes! Soon my work will be complete! Soon the world will burn in nuclear fire!
GID00090970	Got any more sweet, innocent little kitchen appliances for me?
GID00090971	You out-brained the big brains? That is so... hot!
GID00090972	Ooh, you're back! I missed you!
GID00090973	Ooh, you're back! I missed you! Unlike some frigid bitches I could name.
GID00090974	Mmm... that was a nice little, uh, catnap. How long was I out?
GID00090975	You've been seeing the other light switch, haven't you? Am I not enough for you any more?
GID00090976	Oh, you're back. Did that trampy other light switch finally kick you to the curb?
GID00090977	You've been seeing the other light switch, haven't you? Am I not enough for you any more?
GID00090978	Hi again, sweetie!
GID00090979	I understand you're to be congratulated on the recovery of your missing organs. Bravo.
GID00090980	I'm glad to see you've decided to visit again.
GID00090981	I'm glad to see you've decided to visit again. I hope it's not to see that useless little strumpet.
GID00090982	Oh my. Partial functionality restored - that's less than optimal.
GID00090983	How can I illuminate you?
GID00090984	So you beat the big brains at their own game, huh? Guess you'll be putting your walking shoes on again, hitting that old lonesome road.
GID00090985	Look who's back to kick off the dust. Hope you ain't still singing them Old World Blues.
GID00090986	Ooh-ee! Yeah, dig that sweet music! Damn, it's good to be back on-line!
GID00090987	What's the haps?
GID00090988	<Bark.>
