GID00093429	Have you made any electronic components?
GID00093430	I'd like to process some plants.
GID00093431	I have some seditious material for you to process.
GID00093432	Can you turn those lights on for me?
GID00093433	It's not often I meet a light switch with brains and beauty. I think I'm going to like it here.
GID00093434	Can you turn those lights on for me?
GID00093435	A light switch that turns me on? I must be dreaming.
GID00093436	I've got some toasters for you.
GID00093437	I found my brain, now you and I are going to settle things.
GID00093438	I've recovered all the technological information.
GID00093439	Surrender, Mobius, I don't want to fight you.
GID00093440	I've defeated your Giant Robo-Scorpion, you're next.
GID00093441	Are you... my brain?
GID00093442	Come on, let's go. We're getting out of here.
GID00093443	So... what do you say, brain? Join me for some more wild adventures?
GID00093444	If the Think Tank won't hold up their bargain, we'll make them. Let's go.
GID00093445	Don't you want to be reunited? I thought you'd be happy to get back into my head!
GID00093446	Here, take whatever you want.
GID00093447	Sorry, I don't have any.
GID00093448	What function do you serve?
GID00093449	What are you, some kind of novelty talking light switch?
GID00093450	I'll handle the brains. You stay here - you'll be more useful outside my head.
GID00093451	Fine, you can stay here. Not like I need this hassle.
GID00093452	Maybe I have been a little unfair. If you want to stay here, I'll let you.
GID00093453	I saw another light switch in the other room. Do you control that one too?
GID00093454	The more you speak... something's... technical about the way you're squawking at me.
GID00093455	Wait, after listening a bit - that's RobCo termlink protocol you're broadcasting, right?
GID00093456	There's a... pattern to your speech or something.
GID00093457	You're emitting characters in patterns of 8, bracketed, with tone adjustment at the end.
GID00093458	Calm down. I don't plan on hacking your voice module this time.
GID00093459	Good to see you, too, 8. Any new discoveries today?
GID00093460	Blindly operate on any poor animals recently?
GID00093461	Helped any animals discover their genetic potential recently?
GID00093462	I encountered your "pet" in X-8.
GID00093463	I encountered your "pet" in X-8 and had to kill it.
GID00093464	It seems to me you have more... biological needs than your counterparts.
GID00093465	It seems to me you have more... biological needs than your counterparts.
GID00093466	You seem... to... be looking at me a lot.
GID00093467	I can't help but notice your... fascination with the human body.
GID00093468	What did you just say?
GID00093469	My seed? I think you've got your biology mixed up.
GID00093470	My brain told me the Think Tank needs to be stopped. Can you help?
GID00093471	I need my brain back.
GID00093472	I have a real teddy bear, if you want it.
GID00093473	Do you know how I can stop the Think Tank?
GID00093474	Can I have a Mentat?
GID00093475	A good hit with a hammer might fix your monitor.
GID00093476	I can't fix your monitor, but if you're getting ghost reception, I can fix that.
GID00093477	I heard you and 8 were attacked by previous visitors.
GID00093478	Who are you?
GID00093479	Your voice module got damaged, I heard. In an attack.
GID00093480	Uh... if you're speaking that code stuff, I can hack you, right?
GID00093481	If that's RobCo termlink protocol, doesn't that mean it can be hacked?
GID00093482	Is this Gabe's bowl? Your dog from X-8, Gabe?
GID00093483	Does this dog bowl look familiar?
GID00093484	<Display middle finger.>
GID00093485	<Hold up one finger, point at self. Point at them, hold up five fingers.>
GID00093486	So... "O," got any amazing discoveries to share?
GID00093487	I want to talk to you about your name.
GID00093488	So... "Zero," got any amazing discoveries to share?
GID00093489	Your damaged voice module... can you tell me about the attack?
GID00093490	Who are you - what do you do here?
GID00093491	Dr. Mobius' message - can you replay it?
GID00093492	I want to know more about Mobius and the Forbidden Zone.
GID00093493	I have other questions for you.
GID00093494	<Blink slowly with a blank expression.>
GID00093495	<Wave hands and nod.>
GID00093496	Tell me about this "Radar Fence" around the Crater.
GID00093497	Why does Klein want these particular technologies?
GID00093498	Listen, I want to know how I got here... and how I get home.
GID00093499	If you lobotomized the Think Tank, why terrorize them?
GID00093500	I don't understand why you sent the threats - and the Robo-Scorpion army - against the Think Tank.
GID00093501	Wait... sounds like you built the Robo-Scorpions, issued threats to keep the Think Tank occupied.
GID00093502	Can you tell me about the Big Empty?
GID00093503	Can you tell me about the Big Em... uh, Big Mountain?
GID00093504	Who are you? What do you do here?
GID00093505	Why did you steal my brain?
GID00093506	Why did you remove my brain? And... how?
GID00093507	I'm seconds away from smashing your monitors.
GID00093508	I was curious about some things.
GID00093509	I heard one of the previous visitors to the Dome spoke to you, asked you some questions.
GID00093510	I was interested in hearing more about the... science... the others... do. Here.
GID00093511	I'd be honored if I could hear any knowledge the Think Tank had to share on the sciences.
GID00093512	I found a backup copy of your... pencil processor.
GID00093513	I wanted to know more about the Think Tank.
GID00093514	You all seem knowledgeable in your fields. No doubt there's much you can share with me.
GID00093515	Go wait by the entrance. Good dog.
GID00093516	You seem like the one in charge. You are...?
GID00093517	I'm okay. Talk to you later.
GID00093518	Nice. This should be enough.
GID00093519	So these will work in the Sonic Emitter?
GID00093520	Uh... these have been sterilized, too, right?
GID00093521	I'd rather have a good old-fashioned gun.
GID00093522	This sonic gun looks like an energy projectile. Got anything that spits lead?
GID00093523	I could use some more... energy... stuff.
GID00093524	Energy Cells have a high expenditure rate. Some extra reserve cells could offset that.
GID00093525	So genius, what now?
GID00093526	Do these technologies have the information you need?
GID00093527	All right, glad that you received the schematics.
GID00093528	Your answer isn't filling me with confidence.
GID00093529	Something wrong?
GID00093530	"Yes..." what?
GID00093531	Do you even know what these technologies do?
GID00093532	Why did you have me get them if you don't know how they would help?
GID00093533	I'm going to advance my boot into your voice module if you don't give me some solid data.
GID00093534	Maybe the new frequency for the Sonic Emitter can blast open the Forbidden Zone door lock, or...?
GID00093535	Maybe the frequency in the Sonic Emitter's a sonic key of sorts? Like an electronic lockpick?
GID00093536	Think the X-13 sneaky suit can slip in and get to Mobius?
GID00093537	Would the suit's dampening abilities allow me to sneak into the Forbidden Zone?
GID00093538	The antenna looks like it could break things beyond repair. Maybe it could break in?
GID00093539	The antenna, any chance it was damaged, or broke the X-2 array once removed?
GID00093540	I'll let you think it over, then.
GID00093541	These devices all seem very scientific. Very.
GID00093542	Look, the antenna focuses brainwave patterns, right?
GID00093543	And the suit's a cardiac regulator, and the sonic frequency is a spinal vibrator?
GID00093544	Yes?
GID00093545	...I'm waiting for you to draw a conclusion.
GID00093546	Do you remember what other biological effects the other items had?
GID00093547	You may have noticed the pacification field is down. Guess what happens now?
GID00093548	Do you think I killed Mobius?
GID00093549	Mobius and I talked it over, reached an understanding.
GID00093550	I can't let you dissect the Mojave. Or let you leave.
GID00093551	Mobius and I... we... formed an alliance. Sort of.
GID00093552	<Lie> You think I am the Lobotomite...? No, for my skull houses the BRAIN OF MOBIUS!
GID00093553	There's plenty of medical ways to pull off that... stunt.
GID00093554	COUNTLESS brain extraction surgeries exist... but only one IMPLANTATION one - from MOBIUS!
GID00093555	Science provided a way, Klein.
GID00093556	Nothing is unpossible for SCIENCE! Mesons, lasers, atoms, brainwaves... all are at MY command!
GID00093557	<Lie> Do you think I killed Mobius? No, he lives.
GID00093558	He offers a deal - stay here, stay put, and he'll let you live.
GID00093559	Are you willing to risk it?
GID00093560	You FOOLS had best listen. Or MOBIUS will bring his army here, to sting you STUPID.
GID00093561	You can still do that... here, quietly, for me.
GID00093562	I can bring the Mojave, this world to you. You'll be safe, and you'll still be able to experiment.
GID00093564	Is this gun all? Uh, can't have enough guns, really.
GID00093565	Um, this gun looks really hungry. I'd like to make sure it gets fed lots of bullets.
GID00093566	I'm listening, let's hear it.
GID00093567	Just spit it out before you bore me to death.
GID00093568	So just plug it into the circular map-thing in the Sink upstairs?
GID00093569	All right, having a store available would be helpful... it has a store connection right?
GID00093570	Just one of these chips, huh? Guess they're rare.
GID00093571	This chip looks like it was mass-produced. Are there other chips?
GID00093572	So I just go back upstairs and to the main circular console?
GID00093573	I have some questions about this "brain extraction" you all performed.
GID00093574	You said before that Mobius might have my brain?
GID00093575	Why would Mobius want my brain?
GID00093577	So I go after him, then?
GID00093578	Then there's no time to waste.
GID00093579	That's actually not the conclusion I would have drawn.
GID00093580	Don't these items seem more... biologically-focused than that, though?
GID00093581	These technologies seem more useful... medically, somehow.
GID00093582	The cardiac, spinal, and brainwave aspects of this tech... couldn't they heal me?
GID00093583	What was the plan you had?
GID00093584	Well, I don't want to keep them out of trouble, I want to kill them.
GID00093585	Any tactics I could use to attack the Think Tank?
GID00093586	Everything you've told me doesn't add up... your plan, even your name, "Mobius."
GID00093587	Sounds like you forgot your master plan - surprised you remember your own name.
GID00093588	So... you reprogrammed yourself?
GID00093589	You reprogrammed their names as part of recursion loop? What, to trap their processors?
GID00093590	Why did you trap them?
GID00093591	So all this insanity is because of you?
GID00093592	A recursion loop is designed to prevent the flow of information. So...
GID00093593	So that's why they have all those stupid names?
GID00093594	Klein... Mobius... O's a circle... 8's an infinity symbol... they're all loops, I get it.
GID00093595	Keep going, I want to hear the rest of this.
GID00093596	Anything I could do to stop them that doesn't require violence?
GID00093597	I'd really, really like to kill them.
GID00093598	Any suggestions for how to make them change their minds?
GID00093599	I'd like to make the effort.
GID00093600	Scare them? How?
GID00093602	That's kind of an asshole thing to do to your friends.
GID00093603	"Ouro-bor-ous?" What the hell does that mean?
GID00093604	Minor detail, but a snake devouring its own tail is "Ouro-borus," not "Ouro-borous."
GID00093605	But there must have been other signs of a larger world.
GID00093606	There were other visitors, though. Why am I different?
GID00093607	Are you blaming me for this?
GID00093608	Huh? What are you talking about?
GID00093609	The bullet that went into my brain? Doc Mitchell tried to patch me up, but...
GID00093610	What, some kind of medical condition?
GID00093611	A cranial injury. From the attack outside Goodsprings.
GID00093612	So you set your threats on a loop to keep them occupied?
GID00093613	Do you know anything about the other visitors?
GID00093614	What do you mean?
GID00093615	I don't understand why they wanted me to gather the technologies.
GID00093616	Klein said they had the idea to get the three technologies after your broadcast. Coincidence?
GID00093617	What is the purpose of the technologies?
GID00093618	But the Think Tank downloaded the schematics, not the items. They can rebuild them.
GID00093619	Was there any other data transmitted in your threat broadcast?
GID00093620	If you don't get to the point, I'm going to start shooting.
GID00093621	The only "wrinkle" is the one that bullet made going into my brainpan.
GID00093624	I see. Well, I have questions for you.
GID00093658	Is there any way to remove the pacification field in here?
GID00093659	Why did you say "three minus one" subjects before?
GID00093660	But how am I still talking and walking around?
GID00093661	This makes no sense. How is this even possible?
GID00093662	I feel strange in here, peaceful, but on edge.
GID00093663	Is there any way to shut it off?
GID00093664	You don't seem to have a grasp on your own research.
GID00093665	Why have you leveled this place?
GID00093666	All right... when did you create Cazadores?
GID00093667	So Nightstalkers were created for what purpose, then?
GID00093668	Give me a single, concrete fact. One. Fact.
GID00093669	I saw the expanse from the balcony - you've made a mess of this landscape.
GID00093670	This crater looks like it's been tag-teamed by giant fuckbots.
GID00093671	Test cities?
GID00093672	What was this explosion?
GID00093673	That fence doesn't make much sense to me.
GID00093674	So I get my brain back, I can leave.
GID00093675	Wait a minute - that means you're trapped here?
GID00093676	Don't you want to leave here?
GID00093677	But there's a whole world beyond this place.
GID00093678	Evidence to the contrary?
GID00093679	Doesn't that prove you're wrong?
GID00093714	What's your purpose here?
GID00093715	Do you play music?
GID00093716	You seem pretty laid-back for an engine of destruction.
GID00093717	Can you do anything like that for me?
GID00093718	I'd like to talk about something else.
GID00093719	What were the results?
GID00093720	Is that anything like what the other light switch is working on?
GID00093721	I had some more questions.
GID00093722	And what did you find out?
GID00093723	I had other questions.
GID00093724	Sounds like there's some bad blood between you. Or, um, circuits.
GID00093725	I don't know, smart lights could be useful.
GID00093726	Okay then. Forget I said anything.
GID00093727	Calm down, I don't have a thing for the light switch.
GID00093728	What can I say, she and I just... click.
GID00093729	That sounds like what the other light switch was working on.
GID00093730	I found a holotape to upgrade you.
GID00093731	I need my equipment repaired.
GID00093733	If there's nothing more, I need to stop Mobius.
GID00093734	So I can't leave?
GID00093735	There's a perimeter?
GID00093736	That sounds suspiciously like I can't leave.
GID00093737	Why can't you go out there and shut them down?
GID00093738	Uh... thanks.
GID00093739	This thing is pretty cool. It's got a little soundwave thing on the back!
GID00093740	What were you saying about force field disruption?
GID00093741	Oh, I'll be sure not to tamper with anything, I promise.
GID00093742	I'll go get these technological wonders and see how much damage I can do.
GID00093744	If you have the gun already, I don't understand what you need.
GID00093745	If there's a weapon you can give me, hand it over, I'll put it to good use.
GID00093746	For the love of... Please. Stop. Fighting.
GID00093747	Wait... so this gun you gave me can disable Force Fields?
GID00093748	This can only work on fields here in the crater?
GID00093749	I could care less about all of this. Can I go?
GID00093756	Why are you such a dick?
GID00093757	Listen, you're my brain, so you'd better be more respectful!
GID00093758	Actually, yes. I would love a cookie.
GID00093759	Why does my brain sound so... masculine?
GID00093760	How the hell did Mobius get hold of my brain?
GID00093761	Cool! I can talk to my own brain! Can my heart and spine talk, too?
GID00093762	Of course you're responsible! You're my brain!
GID00093763	Oh come on, that stuff's fun!
GID00093764	I didn't realize it caused you so much distress.
GID00093765	We'll revisit this topic later.
GID00093766	I could smash this tank you're in. How about that?
GID00093767	Once you're back in my head, I'll watch television. Lots. And lots. Of television.
GID00093768	Fine, never mind.
GID00093769	Don't tempt me, brain.
GID00093770	I would. And I'd follow it up with an alcohol-and-ant-nectar cocktail every night.
GID00093771	Maybe not, but it got your attention, didn't it?
GID00093772	Never mind. I want to talk about something else.
GID00093773	I don't recall giving you a choice. Let's go.
GID00093774	What's it going to take to convince you?
GID00093775	Come on, we have a duty to the Wasteland, we have to get out of here!
GID00093776	I'm not spending the rest of my life here when there's a whole world to loot.
GID00093777	Hold that thought, we'll come back to it.
GID00093778	Why? They promised to put us back together once I did what they wanted.
GID00093779	Then let's go make them share. Come on, brain, it's stomping time!
GID00093780	How did he manage that?
GID00093781	Hmm. Let me think about this.
GID00093782	That seems like a pretty unlikely coincidence.
GID00093783	Well, that answers that. On to something else.
GID00093784	You talk a lot of science, brain, but you don't make a lot of sense.
GID00093785	Well, you don't have a mouth, but you can talk. Explain that, smarty-pants!
GID00093786	Uh, brain? You seem... awful smart all of a sudden.
GID00093787	All this smart-talk is hurting my head. Please stop it.
GID00093788	What about my spine?
GID00093789	But you're the source of most of those glands. Unless you're arguing that my thyroid is to blame.
GID00093790	That doesn't seem quite right...
GID00093791	Admit it. You're just as glandular as I am.
GID00093792	What's so bad about letting the brains get out? They don't seem that terrible.
GID00093793	You're part of me. I know you don't want to let that happen any more than I do.
GID00093794	Come on! We have to stop them! And stuff!
GID00093795	That's going to be a problem. Until they fix me, I can't leave Big Mountain either.
GID00093796	Are you really saying you'd let the Think Tank outwit us?
GID00093797	I'm going to give them a demonstration of the physics behind small, fast-moving chunks of lead.
GID00093798	I'm going to introduce them to a world of pain. Bullet pain.
GID00093799	I'm going to show them what's really the brightest thing in the room.
GID00093800	We've got lasers, right? I thought we'd use lasers.
GID00093801	Ever had a squirrel brain omelet? That, but on a bigger scale. And with bombs.
GID00093802	I think bombs? Yeah, maybe bombs.
GID00093803	The brains have forgotten the little things. Things like sharp blades and heavy chunks of steel.
GID00093804	I thought since they like lasers so much, I'd surprise them. With a club or something.
GID00093805	I'm going to show them even a video screen can get a black eye.
GID00093806	I sort of thought I'd just start punching things and see where that gets me.
GID00093807	Let's just say violence is the last resort of the civilized man, and I'm feeling mighty uncivilized.
GID00093808	There's no need to be sarcastic. Meeting your own brain is a slightly odd event.
GID00093809	Yes. Because running around a crater full of bizarre science experiments, hygiene is a top priority.
GID00093810	I've been busy.
GID00093811	What about you? That tank isn't exactly looking springtime fresh.
GID00093812	But what about the good things? What about a cool breeze on your cheek, the smell of food... love?
GID00093813	But what about the good things? What about crushing those who oppose you, the smell of fire... loot?
GID00093814	I can see your point. What can I do to make this a fair compromise?
GID00093815	Too bad. I've got arms, you don't. You're coming with me.
GID00093816	Come on, you're my brain and I'm your body. This is meant to be, baby!
GID00093817	Come on, you're my brain and I'm your body. This is meant to be, baby!
GID00093818	I promise I'll take better care of myself.
GID00093819	<Lie> I promise I'll take better care of myself.
GID00093820	Come on, you're my brain and I'm your body. This is meant to be, baby!
GID00093821	Come on, you're my brain and I'm your body. This is meant to be, baby!
GID00093822	Isn't it just as true that you only feel this way because you're lacking those hormones?
GID00093823	You can't really believe that.
GID00093824	So, we're at an impasse. You can't feel what I feel, and I can't think the way you think.
GID00093825	Yeah, bet you didn't think of that, huh?
GID00093826	Look what happened to the Think Tank. Do you want to end up like them after a few hundred years?
GID00093827	I think we have to trust each other and acknowledge that we aren't complete if we're separated.
GID00093828	Well... maybe we could keep going like this. What do you think?
GID00093829	I don't know. I have to think about this some more.
GID00093830	So, what, you'd rather just stay here? Never leaving that tank of... whatever that stuff is?
GID00093831	Well, if you like being stuck in there so much, maybe I'll just leave you.
GID00093832	What would happen to me if I left you here?
GID00093833	Why did you never say anything about how you felt before?
GID00093834	And if I put you back?
GID00093835	Then surely you've taken into account the corrosive effects of long-term exposure to biogel.
GID00093836	You really think you're smarter than the Think Tank and Dr. Mobius combined?
GID00093837	I suppose I'll go back to the Think Tank and get them to let me out. They promised to do that much.
GID00093838	Maybe I'll explore the Big Mountain more before I go back to the Think Tank.
GID00093839	Okay, then. I'm going.
GID00093840	I will!
GID00093841	I've changed my mind. I want you back in my skull after all.
GID00093842	I've thought it over, and I want you back in my head. We're both stronger together.
GID00093843	Great!
GID00093844	This is ridiculous. I can't leave my brain here to rot.
GID00093845	Well... so long, then. I'm going back to the Think Tank. They promised to let me out.
GID00093846	I'm sure. In you go.
GID00093847	On second thought, never mind.
GID00093848	I think I need to think about it some more.
GID00093858	I found that upgrade disk you were looking for.
GID00093859	I found you some upgrade disks.
GID00093860	I lost my Sonic Emitter. Can you make me a new one?
GID00093861	I found a holotape to upgrade you. <REMOVE>
GID00093862	I found a holotape to upgrade you.
GID00093863	Guess I better get walking, then.
GID00093864	Doesn't sound like my style. Maybe I'll do a little exploring.
GID00093865	Then can you help me get this done as quickly as possible? Sounds like a lot of walking.
GID00093866	Pylons? What pylons?
GID00093867	Uh... great. I don't want to hear anymore about that.
GID00093868	Can you please hurry? I've got a schedule.
GID00093869	Forget this. Where's the exit?
GID00093870	The faster I can get through this, the better.
GID00093871	Trust me, I want to get this over with as quickly as possible.
GID00093872	What if I take my time, explore the crater?
GID00093873	Can you tell me more about these pylons?
GID00093874	This whole place sounds dangerous. These devices sound dangerous.
GID00093875	Is that better?
GID00093876	Uh... thanks.
GID00093877	I'll save it for later.
GID00093878	I don't know, I'm tripping pretty hard right now.
GID00093879	I'll save it, don't want to mix it with alcohol if I can help it.
GID00093880	What minions?
GID00093881	I'll trash them like I did your giant piece of junk downstairs.
GID00093882	Whichever way you want to be killed is fine with me.
GID00093883	You aren't exactly what I was expecting.
GID00093884	Exactly. I want my brain so I can leave.
GID00093885	Why is that a problem?
GID00093886	But I want to leave.
GID00093887	Can you tell me about your Robo-Scorpions?
GID00093888	You don't seem aggressive. Why broadcast threats to the Think Tank?
GID00093890	Hi there, puppy.
GID00093891	Come with me, girl.
GID00093892	Why the hell are you just standing there?
GID00093893	So move.
GID00093894	I made you. You stick with me. Got it?
GID00093895	What are you doing, dog?
GID00093896	Go wait somewhere else.
GID00093897	Okay. Heel.
GID00093898	Goodbye.
GID00093900	I found a backup file for your corroded module.
GID00093901	I want to recalibrate the Sonic Emitter.
GID00093910	I think you mean "impossible."
GID00093911	I wanted to talk to you.
GID00093912	What, my Pip-Boy?
GID00093913	Some problem with RobCo?
GID00093914	Agenda? I don't have any agenda, not with RobCo, anyway.
GID00093915	Calm down. Just wanted to ask some questions.
GID00093916	What do you do here?
GID00093917	Do you have another name?
GID00093918	Tell me about Mobius and these monsters of his.
GID00093919	Can you tell me about this facility?
GID00093920	A Giant Robot Scorpion?
GID00093921	I found a backup copy of your... pencil processor.
GID00093922	I found a soundwave file for you.
GID00093924	You said something about needing technologies to stop Mobius?
GID00093925	First, you scoop out my brain, now you want me to save you?!
GID00093926	No, I'm not going to help you.
GID00093927	Why me? Can't you do it?
GID00093928	I'll help. What do you need me to do?
GID00093929	"No?" Why not?
GID00093930	Forget this, I'm not going to help you.
GID00093931	I can say "no," and I'll do it again. I'm leaving.
GID00093932	What makes you so sure Mobius has my brain?
GID00093933	How the hell am I even talking to you right now?
GID00093934	That does it, forget this. I'm not helping you until I get my brain back.
GID00093935	What are these technologies?
GID00093936	I'll head out, then, and be back with these... things.
GID00093937	I had other questions.
GID00093938	That doesn't sound impressive - breaking machines, that is.
GID00093939	Tell me what happened.
GID00093940	Who were the others?
GID00093941	Why is that?
GID00093942	Animal? Did you just call me an animal?
GID00093943	Do you always get this dramatic?
GID00093944	Calm down. I just had some questions.
GID00093945	You are responsible for Cazadores?
GID00093946	Nightstalkers? Those crazy coyote-snake... things?
GID00093947	Contained at Big Mountain? Those things are all over the Mojave!
GID00093948	What makes you think they haven't escaped?
GID00093949	I don't think they're sterile, they breed, all right.
GID00093950	I had other questions.
GID00093951	No, that's all right, trust me.
GID00093952	Go ahead, you might make me more fertile or impregnate me.
GID00093953	How are you all speaking through that one voice box?
GID00093954	I... was at a theater, then... I was here. What is this place?
GID00093955	Are you the ones who performed this surgery on me?
GID00093956	What are you talking about?
GID00093957	I wake up here, all cut apart, and I want some answers.
GID00093958	Lobotomite?
GID00093959	Yes. I'm guessing that crashed satellite was yours?
GID00093960	Who are you all, and what is this place?
GID00093961	Why do I feel... passive? I should be angry - real angry, and I'm not.
GID00093962	Who is Dr. Mobius?
GID00093963	Why do I have this strange... passive sensation in here?
GID00093964	What is this place?
GID00093965	I'd like to know about the Forbidden Zone.
GID00093966	Why the anti-aggression programming?
GID00093967	But I like to fight.
GID00093968	Who were these visitors?
GID00093969	I've heard this place called the "Big Empty."
GID00093971	Talking about things bothering you, well, might help or something.
GID00093972	Are you sure? I'm a good listener. Got the ears for it.
GID00093973	I don't get it. What, they thought your letter was a number?
GID00093974	If they kept confusing the letter with a number, your name is Dr. 0... Dr. Zero?
GID00093975	I don't know. "O" sounds more impressive.
GID00093976	That's... not much of an improvement.
GID00093977	All right, so you want me to call you Zero, or...?
GID00093978	Well, Zero and "O" do look a lot alike, there's no way to tell a difference.
GID00093979	If you wanted to differentiate the "0" and "O," just put a slash through the zero.
GID00093980	"Zero." Draw a slash through it.
GID00093981	It's standard termlink code to distinguish the two.
GID00093982	Are you seriously confused by this, or are you messing with me?
GID00093983	And that's what makes you truly a zero.
GID00093984	So is that what you want to be?
GID00093985	Or you may want to stick with "O." As in, the "Oh!" of discovery.
GID00093986	Well, there's power in zero. It reduces anything multiplied against it - to zero.
GID00093987	Maybe you should dispense with the names and focus on the accomplishments.
GID00093988	I have no idea how you incompetents survived this long.
GID00093989	Well, there's power in zero. It reduces anything multiplied against it - to zero.
GID00093991	It looks like junk.
GID00093992	This scrap metal is supposed to be something?
GID00093993	It certainly is... interesting. Whatever it once was.
GID00093994	What did you and Klein say before about the Central Intelligence Unit barter functions?
GID00093995	I'm going to need something to debug the Central Intelligence barter routines.
GID00093996	I need more of those worthless caps to test the CIU barter functions upstairs.
GID00093997	Well, you don't need to worry about Mr. House anymore.
GID00093998	I don't think I'll worry you by telling you what House and his robots have been up to since.
GID00093999	Heh-heh, nice pun on the header file ref.
GID00094000	Well, the code's got some problems, I'm not arguing that.
GID00094001	Uh... I just realized I'm understanding you.
GID00094002	Well, all life is patterns, you just got to let the unconscious process them.
GID00094003	Not to brag, but I was always more perceptive than everyone else.
GID00094004	So your broadcast pattern is RobCo termlink, but not by choice.
GID00094005	No, no, I understand it's hard to learn a new language.
GID00094006	I agree. If someone would take the time, you're more than just sound effects in a tank.
GID00094007	Um, about when I first arrived. Tell me you didn't sonjaculate into the... my... Sonic Emitter.
GID00094008	How did you fire up the Sonic Emitter when I arrived again?
GID00094009	Well, there had to be some other way to fire it up. Can we at least talk it over next time?
GID00094010	Nothing to be embarrassed about, it's just that it's best to keep that stuff private, you know?
GID00094011	I usually just take a fusion cell and oscillate its charge, vibrates for like, an hour.
GID00094012	Usually, I can find some Cram lying around. Put some duct tape around the lid, good to go.
GID00094013	The less said about it, the better. Let's move on and forget about it.
GID00094014	If that's termlink code, don't worry, I'm not going to take advantage of your exposed code.
GID00094015	It'll only take a second to violate your rights and make your voice mine.
GID00094016	Not a problem. I know what it's like to be experimented on.
GID00094017	All right, all right, quit your grinning, you idiot.
GID00094018	Look, don't make me regret this.
GID00094019	All right. Let's see what you have. I'll take these Energy Cells...
GID00094020	And some Microfusion Cells...
GID00094021	Now, unlock your room, I want what's in there.
GID00094022	And lastly, if I ever need you to blindly agree with me, you will. Understood?
GID00094023	I know it won't work on attack protocols. Still, I may need someone on my side in a debate.
GID00094024	You don't really have a choice. And thanks for the gear.
GID00094025	I didn't catch that. Maybe part of the damage?
GID00094026	Not... sure. What you meant.
GID00094027	This is a waste of time, forget it.
GID00094028	So one of the visitors didn't damage it - he reprogrammed it.
GID00094029	And that took control of the trains? Before you all shut it down.
GID00094030	No wonder you're all skittish.
GID00094031	Like, uh, I would ever hurt you.
GID00094032	I know what it means to be attacked without warning, trust me, 8.
GID00094033	Now that we know each other better, can you tell me about the Sonic Emitter?
GID00094034	Really? Huh.
GID00094035	All right, all right. Don't get all sympathetic and mushy.
GID00094036	Fine, fine. Can we move on?
GID00094037	Um... all right.
GID00094038	You didn't sound too convinced there.
GID00094039	Yeah, I understood that part already.
GID00094040	Well "projecto" is kind of evident. "Emitter" works better.
GID00094041	Higgs' Village? Can you point it out on my Pip-Boy?
GID00094042	No, I've been there. Higgs Village, right? Your house is there?
GID00094043	That sounds interesting. Sure, directions would be nice.
GID00094044	Well, I didn't rob your place, but it's this big hangar in the middle of the Crater, so...
GID00094045	So your house is there?
GID00094046	Well, what - you want me to rob your place?
GID00094047	So there's an emitter code in your house in Higgs?
GID00094048	Oh, two codes. One for the jukebox, and one for the opera. Nice. I'll keep an eye out.
GID00094049	You know... sonjaculate.
GID00094050	Wait, how many? One... or...?
GID00094051	Fan of the opera, huh? All right - the jukebox is installed in the Sink, got it.
GID00094052	No, I got it all down, thanks.
GID00094053	I may have already picked up both, I grab almost anything that's not nailed down.
GID00094054	I got the Emitter fully upgraded.
GID00094055	I'm happy, too. Can't let this thing gather dust.
GID00094056	It's a little slow to fire, but the force field disabling frequency is handy.
GID00094057	Too bad the force field disruption only works here.
GID00094058	Are you okay? You look... really happy.
GID00094059	You're kind of creeping me out.
GID00094060	Something wrong? Your monitors are getting all fuzzy.
GID00094061	You should be proud. It's a nice device.
GID00094062	All right, all right, don't get too pleased to see it working at full capacity.
GID00094063	Please don't make me spell it out.
GID00094064	Oh... hey, thanks. Don't want it to run out, you're right.
GID00094065	Great. More energy cells. Just what I need.
GID00094066	I mean, literally, got anything to help pass the time?
GID00094067	Um... maybe it's like a memory or something?
GID00094068	Sounds like Gabe really loved you.
GID00094069	Well, it seems to me it belongs to a friend of yours.
GID00094071	It sounds to me like you hurt someone who loved you very much.
GID00094072	It's nothing to be ashamed of. Gabe knew his place - as a specimen.
GID00094073	Hope you think on what you've done.
GID00094074	<Close eyelids, breathe deeply, then stretch languidly.>
GID00094075	<Turn and cough roughly, then slowly scratch nose.>
GID00094076	<Run your hands along the sides of your face, then exhale rapidly.>
GID00094077	Why don't you just give in? There's nothing wrong with looking at the human body.
GID00094078	You all are a bunch of hypocrites. Claiming superiority, but you miss being human, admit it.
GID00094079	I could come back any time and just breathe, if you want.
GID00094080	I'll tell the others if you don't make it worth my while.
GID00094081	I'm actually here for a... breather.
GID00094082	A looping gesture of extortion, maybe. Hand over the goods.
GID00094083	Well, I thought you liked them. You keep referring to them.
GID00094084	Are you sure your words aren't jumbled?
GID00094085	You are totally confusing me right now.
GID00094086	Um... so you confuse toy bears with... humans?
GID00094087	Oh, I get it - you like "playing" with humans, do you? Watching them move? Blink?
GID00094088	You know, we've been down this road already. Moving on.
GID00094089	Mugs? Why do you want mugs?
GID00094090	Who are you?
GID00094091	You seem really obsessed with mugs.
GID00094092	What do you do with the mugs?
GID00094093	Let's change the subject.
GID00094094	Can you do anything else?
GID00094095	I'm ready, let's do it.
GID00094096	I'm feeling a little unwell in the head. Can you perform a psychiatric evaluation on me?
GID00094097	On second thought, not now.
GID00094098	So you make blank books? What's the point of that?
GID00094099	But those books are our last legacy of the time before! You can't destroy them!
GID00094100	Blank books, huh? Yeah, I think I can find a use for those.
GID00094101	I had some other questions.
GID00094102	Can you do anything besides processing books?
GID00094103	I'd enjoy that.
GID00094104	Why wait? I can talk about theorems right now.
GID00094105	Maybe. I'll let you know.
GID00094106	Only the sexy ones.
GID00094107	Never. I'm all yours, baby.
GID00094108	You're right. I do.
GID00094109	"Sir?" You are aware that I'm a woman, right?
GID00094110	Are you some kind of Artificial Intelligence?
GID00094111	What services do you provide?
GID00094112	Why are there so many personality modules?
GID00094113	You mean there are other... personality modules here?
GID00094114	Why is that?
GID00094115	So I can access their functions without loading the personality holotapes?
GID00094116	Never mind, let me ask you something else.
GID00094117	I'd like to buy some things.
GID00094118	Switch on the Sink's personality matrices.
GID00094119	Switch off the Sink's personality matrices.
GID00094120	I have some personality holotapes to install.
GID00094121	I don't need anything else. Goodbye.
GID00094122	Tremble? You're a toaster. How fearsome can you be?
GID00094123	I'm almost afraid to ask what your function is.
GID00094124	Well, I for one am quaking in my boots.
GID00094125	Why all the rage?
GID00094126	I'd like to change the subject.
GID00094127	So you murder toasters?
GID00094128	What else do you do?
GID00094129	About that Superheated Saturnite Power Fist...
GID00094130	You mean like this one?
GID00094131	I'll keep an eye out for any Saturnite Power Fists then.
GID00094132	You know the world already burned in nuclear fire, right?
GID00094133	Give it up. I have more important things to ask you about.
GID00094134	Yes. A couple centuries ago, in fact.
GID00094135	<Lie> No, I'm just kidding. Keep living the dream.
GID00094136	But I hurt all over!
GID00094137	That doesn't explain the laser-sutures on my chest... and on my spine.
GID00094138	Why am I all cut up? I feel like some kid was playing with my insides.
GID00094139	How much surgery did you do on me? I feel like a badly-put-together jigsaw puzzle.
GID00094140	You removed my brain?
GID00094141	Lobtomizing? You lobotomized me?
GID00094142	Is that why I feel so odd - and heavy?
GID00094143	He... er, I, offer a DEAL. Stay HERE. Stay PUT, and he'll... I'll let you LIVE.
GID00094144	If you don't tell me what I need to find, I can't help you, all right?
GID00094146	Um... before I go "reclaim" this tech, are you sure your plan will work?
GID00094147	What exactly is the plan? You're losing me in the generalities, I need specifics.
GID00094148	Did you say "barter?"
GID00094149	I can trade with the Sink Intelligence? Then I'll need something to activate that function, won't I?
GID00094150	I have some questions for you first.
GID00094151	You said... "surge" code? You mean like computer stuff in the Doc?
GID00094152	What's this Auto-Doc surgery code you mentioned?
GID00094153	So the Comp-Doc does... what Mobius would do if he was here, chopping me up?
GID00094154	Mobius set up the Auto-Doc medical routines, so you think he's responsible for the post-organ-dump?
GID00094155	My brain would know?
GID00094156	What do you mean?
GID00094157	Come on. Brains can't talk... well, most brains.
GID00094158	Wait... the metal scorpions can sting you stupid?
GID00094159	These mechanical Robo-Scorpions "consume" intelligence? Are you certain of your findings?
GID00094160	I don't understand how poisons can dumbify you.
GID00094161	Robo-Scorpions drain intelligence from living creatures - how? Chems?
GID00094162	Sounds to me like your math is wrong - and the odds aren't good.
GID00094163	It's not a democracy, it's a research facility. And over half your colleagues dispute your findings.
GID00094164	I do. Here's the deal. I'm not going to surrender - you are.
GID00094165	Maybe you should confer with your colleagues first.
GID00094166	I will PERMIT you to do this. For ME.
GID00094167	You took out my brain, heart, and spine?
GID00094168	If you ripped out my brain, where the hell is it?
GID00094169	You extracted my brain... but what do you mean, "misplaced" it?
GID00094170	Um... excuse me, do you have any more?
GID00094171	This amount clearly represents a deficiency in the amount of caps needed.
GID00094172	Still feels a little light. Might need a little more.
GID00094173	I'd hate to come back and ask for more. A little extra would guarantee you're not disturbed.
GID00094174	The ton of things sounds good.
GID00094175	Hold on, let's be logical about this. I don't need a ton, just as much as I can carry in trade.
GID00094176	So if I don't get my brain back in my head, I can't leave, ever?
GID00094177	Fine, you've got a deal.
GID00094182	You're Doctor O, correct?
GID00094183	Uh... what was that?
GID00094184	Can you speak? Do you understand me?
GID00094185	I have no idea what you're saying right now.
GID00094186	Did something happen with your voice module?
GID00094187	Blasting me with static-y clicks isn't helpful.
GID00094188	That... uh... is too bad. Or good. Or something.
GID00094189	Can I ask you some questions?
GID00094190	Do you know anything about Dr. Mobius or the Forbidden Zone?
GID00094191	Is... that a yes? Or a no? Or... a yes-no?
GID00094192	You better not be cussing me out right now.
GID00094193	I'm pretty sure you can understand me, and I want some answers.
GID00094194	Can you tell me about these technologies Klein wants?
GID00094195	Tell me about the Big Empty.
GID00094196	Tell me about the Big Empty... uh, Big Mountain, that is.
GID00094197	All right, all right... just calm down. Didn't mean to alarm you.
GID00094198	You're going to pop a monitor shaft if you keep that up.
GID00094199	I got it already, those two names give you nightmares.
GID00094200	You sound a little down.
GID00094201	Are you all right? Kind of ran out of steam in the middle there.
GID00094202	If you just said, "this place seems like a scientific loony bin," I agree.
GID00094203	No need to get indignant, was just asking a question.
GID00094204	Whoa, easy there... whatever you are. Brain. Jar. Thing.
GID00094205	Would you rather I called it the Big Shithole?
GID00094206	You sound agitated. Or you're percolating. Or something.
GID00094207	I swear your brain... tank... thing just sparked.
GID00094208	Knew asking you would be useless.
GID00094209	Um... good to meet you... uh... double... circle... a... dash... whoever.
GID00094210	Sounds important. I think.
GID00094211	Maybe I should have asked who you used to be.
GID00094212	I have no idea what you just said. Moreso than usual.
GID00094213	Like I said, technical. Very technical.
GID00094214	Forget I brought it up. Until I bring it up again.
GID00094215	Um... yes, definitely a pattern.
GID00094216	We'll just move on, I need time to figure this out.
GID00094217	You really make me want to kick that voice box of yours.
GID00094218	I'm just full of surprises.
GID00094219	Well, I've hacked enough RobCo terminals to know.
GID00094220	Can't get away from their code, even with voice modules, huh?
GID00094221	Well, I just heard the rhythm in the sequence is all.
GID00094222	I have an ear for it, I suppose.
GID00094223	I know, I probably should put it to use counting cards.
GID00094224	Trust me, I'll get the technologies, all right?
GID00094225	No, haven't dealt with Mobius yet.
GID00094226	I'll talk to Klein in a second, quit pressuring me.
GID00094227	You're welcome, 8. It was my pleasure.
GID00094228	Enough. I had questions.
GID00094229	The quick Scribe jumped over the lazy Paladin?
GID00094230	"Looping gesture of greeting?"
GID00094231	What recursive behavior patterns are you talking about?
GID00094232	Can you tell me about Dr. Mobius?
GID00094233	Not exactly. I have questions I need answers to.
GID00094234	Not right now. I have questions instead.
GID00094235	What's "formography?"
GID00094236	211 doctorates? How is that even possible?
GID00094237	"First head chief researcher?" Lot of titles.
GID00094238	I don't understand how the tech Klein wants will help.
GID00094239	Can you tell me about the Big Empty?
GID00094240	Can you tell me about the Big Empty... uh, Big Mountain?
GID00094241	Previous test subjects?
GID00094242	This used to be a mountain?
GID00094243	Questions? Like what?
GID00094244	I'm sometimes called a "Courier."
GID00094245	There was another Courier?
GID00094246	I had other questions.
GID00094247	What was the question?
GID00094248	What happened with the visitors?
GID00094249	I'd like to engage your services.
GID00094250	Can you do anything beyond healing me?
GID00094251	I command you to open your port and receive my seed!
GID00094252	What does that mean?
GID00094253	Tell me again about what you do.
GID00094254	So if I bring you samples of dried plant life, you can clone them and grow them in these planters?
GID00094255	What's Salient Green?
GID00094256	Eradicate sedition?
GID00094257	You seem kind of worried about dirt. What's wrong?
GID00094258	I'd just like a drink, thanks.
GID00094259	I just came over to fill some of these empty bottles.
GID00094293	I'm not handing my brain over... there's some things we should discuss.
GID00094294	I think you're past due for your lobotomy, Klein.
GID00094316	I found a holotape to upgrade you.
GID00094337	Got anything for me? Let's see.
GID00094338	Um... got anything to help me "pass" the "time?"
GID00094339	It's me again. I wanted to ask some questions.
GID00094340	I wanted to ask you some @@[?-*##*-?]@@? questions.
GID00094341	Not to cut your speech off - is there something coming in on the big monitor?
GID00094342	I don't give a shit what you have to say. Tell me why you hauled me here. Now.
GID00094343	I think I'm going to kill you after all.
GID00094344	Enough. I'm here to kill you.
GID00094345	Got to go.
GID00094346	I don't need anything right now.
GID00094347	I have to go now.
GID00094348	Nothing right now. Goodbye.
GID00094349	I'll talk to you later.
GID00094350	I have to go. We'll talk later.
GID00094351	I have to go now.
GID00094352	I have to go now.
GID00094353	This is too weird. I'll be back later.
GID00094354	Goodbye.
GID00094355	That's all for now. Goodbye.
GID00094356	Time for me to go. Goodbye.
GID00094357	We've spoken enough.
GID00094358	Never mind, we've spoken enough.
GID00094359	I'll be going now.
GID00094360	I think we've spoken long enough.
