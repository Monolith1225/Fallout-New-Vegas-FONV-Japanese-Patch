GID00111088	Use a stimpak, you look a little beaten up.
GID00111089	Let's get going.
GID00111090	Wait here.
GID00111091	Let's get going.
GID00111092	Wait here.
GID00111093	Let's get going.
GID00111094	Wait here.
GID00111095	Let's get going.
GID00111096	Wait here.
GID00111097	Do you mind following me? I could use you.
GID00111098	Wait here for me, I'll be back.
GID00111099	Let's get going.
GID00111100	Wait here.
GID00111102	You killed my brothers and sister. You blew up my home... Prepare to die.
GID00111104	Where are you hit?
GID00111105	So, this Maria thing. It told me to go find some switches. Where the hell are they?
GID00111106	[Born Soldier I] Why did you decide to admit me, just like that?
GID00111107	Display System Status; use to access network server and fix programme faults.
GID00111108	No, I want to get more experience in science to work on this stuff. This shit is crazy hard.
GID00111109	Hey, Joe. Somebody told me I have a job in maintenance starting tomorrow?
GID00111111	What's that noise?
GID00111112	What's that noise?
GID00111114	Oh no! Dr. Rossman, are you okay?
GID00111115	Wow man, you're really upbeat. Most people I've seen tonight are total dicks.
GID00111116	What happened here?
GID00111117	[Group] Tell everyone to get going.
GID00111119	Hey, when you said you wanted to spend time together, what did you mean?
GID00111120	Hey, when you said you wanted to spend time together, what did you mean?
GID00111122	A standard 3000lb door with a digital lock, extra reinforcement...
GID00111123	A standard 3000lb door with a digital lock, extra reinforcement...
GID00111124	What kinds of training do I need to have to get access to the best weapons?
GID00111126	So. Jen told me that there is a special "list" good athletes can get on. Can I see your list?
GID00111127	Display Maintenance Menu; use this menu to manually repair nearby systems.
GID00111128	What happened to the external network connections on that old server?
GID00111129	Just exploring. What are you up to, Joe?
GID00111130	Wait here.
GID00111133	Sir, yes sir!
GID00111134	Colonel Bragg is dead.
GID00111135	Hey. About what you said earlier, about doing something. What'd you have in mind?
GID00111137	You got this, man! Just keep it together!
GID00111138	You got this man, just keep it together!
GID00111139	I... I can't stay. I have to get out of here!
GID00111140	Yeah, it would have been nice to have family there, but it's alright.
GID00111141	Yeah, not yet.
GID00111142	I... I... Just wanted to explore?
GID00111143	Joe said there is a pipe that's causing you problems?
GID00111145	Where did you come from, dude? What's with the spears?
GID00111146	Are there any other survivors in here?
GID00111147	[Group] Tell everyone to wait here.
GID00111148	We need to find a way out of these apartments. Will you follow me?
GID00111149	I was looking over your notes on the Exodites. Impressive study.
GID00111150	It's nothing. Just got a little roughed up is all.
GID00111151	Sir, with all due respect, you're staying here. Why?
GID00111153	I could try to talk him out...
GID00111154	I could try to talk him out...
GID00111155	Uughn...
GID00111156	What happened?
GID00111157	I just wanted to ask you some questions.
GID00111158	Is there a special permission or requirement to be a Wasteland Scout?
GID00111159	Um... um... yeah?
GID00111160	I haven't talked to him yet. Obviously.
GID00111161	Yeah, sure. I was about to make the play, the Johnny came right at me and--
GID00111163	StarPlayer: I'm in a vault in-- Wa8... isn't Brazil a country?
GID00111164	StarPlayer: I'm in a Vault in-- Wa8... isn't Brazil a country?
GID00111165	Log out.
GID00111166	Are there any other cool things I can work on? I'm done with computers.
GID00111167	I want a lotta shit. What you got, old man?
GID00111168	What can I do to help?
GID00111170	I made my own uniform, I was just eager to join the fight! ...Be right back!
GID00111171	I made my own uniform, I was just eager to join the fight! ...Be right back!
GID00111172	The vault reactors are set to melt down. We have to get out of here!
GID00111174	I was rendered unconscious in the lower apartments.
GID00111175	John, follow me.
GID00111176	What do you mean? Coach Bragg did this?
GID00111178	LET ME SEE YOUR WAR FACE!
GID00111179	LET ME SEE YOUR WAR FACE!
GID00111180	What's the situation?
GID00111182	You're still alive? I can fix that for you.
GID00111183	[Sweet Talker] Hey, do you know anything about Jen next door?
GID00111184	Oh... right. 'Night, Mandy.
GID00111186	I want to know your plans for keeping the vault open. What's the math on that?
GID00111187	I want to know your plans for keeping the vault open. What's the math on that?
GID00111188	Run fast and shit? Is that all you think I do?
GID00111192	Earnest told me the Overseer wants to see me?
GID00111194	Dude, where did you guys get all this ammo? It's like an armory in here.
GID00111196	Where do we go from here?
GID00111197	Where do we go from here?
GID00111199	I hate to bring it up... but are you sure you're fit to fight?
GID00111200	I hate to bring it up... but are you sure you're fit to fight?
GID00111201	I'm fine. Had a bit of a fight in the hallway, but I made it. What about you?
GID00111202	This area isn't safe, Jen. We need to go to the hydroponics lab.
GID00111206	I'm sure you didn't mean to break it. No hard feelings, then.
GID00111207	Look, Johnny, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to injure you like this.
GID00111214	I got this shit. Stand aside, mortals.
GID00111215	I got this shit. Stand aside, mortals.
GID00111216	[Intelligence] Dr.Rossman? The Robotics and Computer Analytics teacher?
GID00111217	Good talk, Coach.
GID00111219	Fuck's yea, white bread!
GID00111221	No. I'm busy, thanks.
GID00111225	You're a Wasteland Scout. What can you tell me about what's up there?
GID00111226	I couldn't find that stupid busted pipe. Where is it again?
GID00111228	Listen, old man, we'll get through this. The war may never change, but this one's over.
GID00111229	Listen old man, we'll get through this. The war may never change, but this one's over.
GID00111230	Listen old man, we'll get through this. The war may never change, but this one's over.
GID00111236	Okay, back up. What's the situation? From the beginning.
GID00111237	How do I get to the upper apartments?
GID00111238	So, what do we do?
GID00111240	[Born Soldier I] Have you ever talked with Chevy before, Mandy?
GID00111242	Tch tch tch, no-- Shoosh. Shawn, why did you miss my game?
GID00111243	Dude! Really? We've been working towards this for weeks! Where were you, bro?
GID00111245	It seems like the kids in Vault 18 really dislike adults. Why?
GID00111246	It seems like the kids in Vault 18 really dislike adults. Why?
GID00111248	Yes, sir, it has. I've been great! Added another win for the team today.
GID00111249	Yeah, sure! How do I get there?
GID00111252	Just exploring. Out to see the vault before bed.
GID00111260	What's the plan now?
GID00111261	Yeah, it totally rocked. Thank you.
GID00111262	So how's life, Eric?
GID00111264	I think you should wait here. I'll work ahead and let you know when it's safe to follow.
GID00111265	I don't really want to talk about it. Eric said I should see to you.
GID00111266	Yeah... Dr. Rossman said you carried me to the infirmary... Thanks, I guess.
GID00111267	Jen! Jen... It's me, &pcname;! Are you alright?
GID00111272	Hey! We survived, alright! Pull it together!
GID00111273	Wait here. I think you may be safe for a while.
GID00111274	Yeah, yeah, of course you're sorry. I really don't care.
GID00111275	Well, sorry about that. It's the sort of risk that comes with the sport. Tough luck.
GID00111276	I wanted to talk to you, see how you've been. Just thought you looked a little lonely.
GID00111280	I really don't know what to do, Colonel. I'm not as prepared for this as I thought I was.
GID00111281	Where is Dr. Bishop?
GID00111287	Yes, sir, I am. May I come in?
GID00111288	Yes, sir, I am. May I come in?
GID00111291	For you Jen, I've got hours.
GID00111292	For you Jen, I've got hours.
GID00111293	Wait... what!? No, no? Si, I mean, nein? Nein, Maria! Nein!
GID00111294	I fixed the first-tier networks!
GID00111295	[Lie] I found the pipe and decided it doesn't need fixing.
GID00111296	(lie) I found the pipe and decided it doesn't need fixing.
GID00111297	(lie) I found the pipe and decided it doesn't need fixing.
GID00111299	Pull it together! Just spell it out. Sorry for what? What did you do?
GID00111300	We're launching a final attack on the lab!
GID00111301	Lost?
GID00111303	This place could fall apart any moment, we have to get out of here!
GID00111304	How do I get to the hydroponics lab?
GID00111305	Thanks for talking.
GID00111306	Where are you hit?
GID00111307	Mandy, I lost. I even broke my leg. Thanks.
GID00111308	It's nothin', man, don't worry about it.
GID00111310	I want you to be honest, and tell me what you know about our parents.
GID00111311	I want you to be honest, and tell me what you know about our parents.
GID00111313	Yeah. I'm just playin' the game. Getting by. Working in the lab.
GID00111314	You know, you haven't had your customary post-game beat-down in a while...
GID00111315	Um... Nothing?
GID00111316	Not much. Good night.
GID00111323	Alpha: Initiate runtime, "B6:LineC001."
GID00111324	Alpha: Initiate runtime, "B6:LineC001."
GID00111328	Alright, enough talking.
GID00111329	Good to know you were supporting us.
GID00111330	What's up with you and Jamie? There are certain rumors around. You know...?
GID00111332	I think you should come with me. It's not safe in these apartments. We're going to the lab.
GID00111333	Yeah. Annihilated. In every way. You'll get yours later Jamie. Fuck, off.
GID00111335	Quit crying and start paying attention, now!
GID00111336	Quit crying and start paying attention, now!
GID00111346	Never mind, let's keep going.
GID00111347	Um, Johnny? You okay, pal?
GID00111348	Um, Johnny? Great to see you too, pal.
GID00111349	Get lost, Johnny, I don't give a shit about your phony apology.
GID00111350	Oh, piss off, Johnny, an asshole like you deserved that. You fuck with the bull, you get the horns.
GID00111352	What are you doing in here? This room looks kinda messy.
GID00111356	Why would Christianson set the self-destruct?
GID00111358	[Born Soldier II] Sergeant Chevy said you had some important information for me?
GID00111359	[Born Soldier II] Sergeant Chevy said you had some important information for me?
GID00111360	Right. Be right back.
GID00111361	I fixed the second-tier networks!
GID00111367	Wait wait wait... You have no reason to kill me. My Science skills could be useful.
GID00111368	Wait wait wait... You have no reason to kill me. My Science skills could be useful.
GID00111369	Wait wait wait... You have no reason to kill me. My Science skills could be useful.
GID00111372	Go ahead. Talk some more shit, dork, see what happens.
GID00111389	The Vault's reactor is set to self destruct! Comeon, we have to get out of here!
GID00111391	I'll explain later, lets go!
GID00111393	Wait here, I'll come back for you two in a minute! Don't move!
GID00111396	Listen. I need you to run to the Vault entrance! Go!
GID00111399	Ha, thanks Jamie.
GID00111436	I shot him. He set the self-destruct and doomed us all.
GID00111471	They didn't make it. Bragg's first attack killed them, and nearly killed me.
GID00111472	I don't like where this is going.
GID00111473	I don't believe this. You are supposed to be our leader! Why are you cowering here?
GID00111474	Shit! If it's an explosive charge, I can fix it. The reactor? I can reverse the overload!
GID00111475	Well, that was stupid. Look, I'll grab everyone I can and run. We will survive this. Without you.
GID00111476	Ooh. That's not good. Now what do we do?
GID00111481	What's that noise?
GID00111482	What's that noise?
GID00111486	Raaaaaaaaaaa!!!
GID00111488	What's that noise?
GID00111489	What's that noise?
GID00111490	Sir, yes sir!
GID00111491	No way in hell! Fuck you, Bragg!
GID00111499	Fuck no!
GID00111510	Wait wait wait... I'm sure we can work this out. Just give me a chance to prove it. Come on!
GID00111511	Wait wait wait... I'm sure we can work this out. Just give me a chance to prove it. Come on!
GID00111512	Wait wait wait... You have no reason to kill me, I could be useful!
GID00111513	Wait wait wait... You have no reason to kill me. I could be useful.
GID00111515	Like hell. Raaaaaaaa!
GID00111516	Like hell. Raaaaaaaa!
GID00111517	Like hell. Raaaaaaaa!
GID00111526	Right. Fantastic.
GID00111527	They're dead, John.
GID00111531	It doesn't matter. Just keep moving. Go!
GID00111533	Forget it. You heard the man. Let's move!
GID00111558	Do you hear that? Who's that crying?
GID00111559	Do you hear that? Who's that crying?
GID00111561	If they're after the Overseer, Bragg must be in the Admin Office. We have to fight back.
GID00111562	If they're overthrowing Christianson, where is he? Is he still alive?
GID00111563	Bragg killed my family... We have to fight back!
GID00111564	So, the hydroponics lab is locked? And the upper apartments are behind enemy lines...
GID00111566	Let's do this! Go, go, go!
GID00111567	LETS DO THIS! Go Go Go!
GID00111568	Whatever. I didn't want the albino pervert with the toy laser gun following me, anyway.
GID00111569	I think Bragg has the right idea. I'm just on the wrong side.
GID00111570	Relax, I was just joking. How do we fight these bastards?
GID00111571	It's the promise of a better tomorrow, under your president, John Henry Eden!
GID00111572	Me, motherfucker! Hahahaha!
GID00111575	What the hell is going on?
GID00111576	They're dead... I don't know what's going on.
GID00111591	Patriots? Why are they calling themselves that?
GID00111592	I want to know something else.
GID00111593	We need to find a way to talk to them. Calm their nerves. This is madness.
GID00111594	I don't know how the hell we're going to rebuild after this. Should we even take prisoners?
GID00111595	We can still win this. Push them hard and drive them out of the vault!
GID00111599	I know how to treat this. A couple stimpacks and compression, and you're good.
GID00111600	I know how to treat this. A couple stimpacks and compression, and you're good.
GID00111601	But... Where do I go from here?
GID00111602	Hey, hey! Stay with me, Doc! Don't you die on me yet!
GID00111603	Doc... Sleep easy, old man. See you on the other side.
GID00111606	The old Alpha Droid... is it active?
GID00111607	The old Alpha Droid... is it active?
GID00111608	But... Where do I go from here?
GID00111617	Terra? What the hell is going on?
GID00111624	Fine. Lead the way.
GID00111625	No. We end this, now.
GID00111632	Oh, yeah, totally. I was just on my way to... fall in line.
GID00111633	Oh, yeah, totally. I was just on my way to... Fall in line.
GID00111634	My brother and sister are dead. Terra, tell me you didn't have something to do with this.
GID00111636	Why? Why are you doing this? You were a nice girl, Terra!
GID00111637	Why? Why are you doing this? You were a nice girl, Terra!
GID00111640	I just want to leave. I hope you can live with it. Get out of my way, Terra.
GID00111641	Fine. Lead the way.
GID00111642	No. We end this, now.
GID00111643	You... Idiot! You'll pay for this! Raa!
GID00111646	I... I don't know. What the hell is going on?
GID00111647	Go fuck yourself, you psycho cunt!
GID00111649	You aren't going to talk about the game?
GID00111653	Alright. You take care. Enjoy your game.
GID00111670	Do you ever think about them? Our parents, I mean.
GID00111671	Hey, isn't that a little mean? Kira's had it rough.
GID00111672	Yeah. We may be from different dads, but I'm glad we're family.
GID00111678	Do you have anything that can help my leg?
GID00111679	It's okay, Mandy. I forgive you.
GID00111680	No. And I don't want you to. Fuck off.
GID00111681	Have you talked to Jason at all tonight?
GID00111699	Nuh-uh. Stop right there, dork. I had one chance to win that game. This could've waited.
GID00111700	Hey... I broke my leg tonight. Then I reprogrammed an entire computer network. Quit bitching.
GID00111701	Um, not really? Broken leg? I'm high on Med-X and still limping like a land fish.
GID00111702	I don't know, dude. Just... Part of Vault planning. All of us have to do it.
GID00111703	Nah, I'll just stick to my PC, thanks.
GID00111704	Sure! What are you playing?
GID00111709	Fine. It's nothin', "bro", don't worry about it.
GID00111710	Yup. *cracks knuckles*
GID00111711	No, I forgive you. Whatever you were up to must have been important.
GID00111712	Yeah, I am. White anger burns hotter than red. You'll get yours.
GID00111713	Nope. What game are you guys playing?
GID00111714	Wait, wait... So if there's all of this back story, how does it affect game play?
GID00111715	So... What's the point of having all that... Text?
GID00111716	Ugh. Dorks. Try to keep it down. I'm crashin' to bed, man.
GID00111717	Not... Really. It's just a game. I'm going to crash to bed, bro. Try to keep it down?
GID00111726	That's all I can think of. I should head to bed.
GID00111728	Shawn will be fine, sir. He just needs... A little encouragement.
GID00111729	Shawn will be fine, sir. He just needs... A little encouragement.
GID00111731	You have a problem with my brother?
GID00111732	You have a problem with my brother?
GID00111733	So, why did you call me in here?
GID00111739	I think it was just a gesture, but I didn't get the post.
GID00111741	Uuhhmm... No?
GID00111742	Uuhhmm... No?
GID00111743	Don't you want to... I don't know, look into that?
GID00111744	So, I can just go then?
GID00111745	Yeah... I kinda might have. But, hey! It wasn't my fault, I was just checking to see if it worked.
GID00111746	I was reconnecting an old server line, and its seems our vault is part of a holo-net.
GID00111747	I don't know, should I look into it?
GID00111748	Aw hell, man, you know. Winnin'. Beatin' pussy. Fuckin' up shit in this bitch. Good times.
GID00111753	Ha, you only know that because you like to watch.
GID00111754	Dude, just make your point.
GID00111757	Brute strength! Pow, right in the guts, and tossed 'im like a rag!
GID00111758	Brute Strength! Pow, right in the guts and tossed 'im like a rag!
GID00111760	Just the right application of torque to the calf at the right moment, and BAM!
GID00111761	Just the right application of torque to the calf at the right moment, and BAM!
GID00111763	Physics. Give me leverage and 9.82m/s and I'll crack the world!
GID00111764	Physics. Give me leverage and 9.82m/s and I'll crack the world!
GID00111768	Errr... Herp der... I hit hard. Go explore.
GID00111769	Errr.... herp der... I hit hard. Go explore.
GID00111794	Thanks! It was a really awesome night.
GID00111795	Ah, yeah. Now I'm just seeing what else I can find to do.
GID00111796	Um... Sure. I'll give it a look. It's just out this door, right? On the wall by the grate?
GID00111799	No. I just want to get past you and end this dream.
GID00111800	Who are you? Why are you here?
GID00111801	Alright. That was weird. Lets end this.
GID00111803	Try me.
GID00111804	Try me.
GID00111806	Maybe we can talk this out. What's your name?
GID00111807	Maybe we can talk this out. What's your name?
GID00111811	Uh... No.
GID00111812	That's all. Let's get going.
GID00111813	Let's talk about something else.
GID00111816	Ben?
GID00111817	Let me guess: You regained your memories.
GID00111818	Let me guess: you regained your memories.
GID00111819	Let me guess: you regained your memories.
GID00111829	Well... what the hell happened here?
GID00111830	Dude, I hate to break it to you, but I totally just double tapped Chevy for you. She wasn't dead.
GID00111831	Woah, chill out there, killer. Come on, lets get out of here before this place explodes.
GID00111832	So, if you don't mind my asking... what's with this ring of corpses and the body paint?
GID00111833	Nevermind.
GID00111871	Lets go.
GID00111874	Let's talk about your tactics.
GID00111875	I want you to change your combat style.
GID00111881	Switch to a melee weapon.
GID00111892	I managed to run through the pipeworks. Place was a mess.
GID00111893	Shut up and get of my way.
GID00111894	How did you manage to survive in here? The Patriots have been in control this whole time!
GID00111895	Tell me something else.
GID00111898	I wanted to ask you about something else.
GID00111899	Are you still trying out to be one of the Wasteland Scouts?
GID00111900	Dude, we were like, two. Dr. Rossman says starting a gunfight is what gets people killed, right?
GID00111901	You're very determined.
GID00111902	And you think you're going to be one of them?
GID00111903	I'm not so sure. People have been living down here for too many years.
GID00111904	Lets change the subject.
GID00111905	Easy, I just wanted to ask.
GID00111906	But isn't she... Your sister?
GID00111907	Any problems? Yeah, I do have a problem with that, you freak.
GID00111908	No, not at all. I'm just wondering how you get along with each other. Everybody always... you know.
GID00111909	You've probably been through hard times. All of us have.
GID00111911	Eric, I don't care what those pricks say. You're alright, and I'll stand up for you if needed.
GID00111912	Eric, I don't care what those pricks say. You're alright, and I'll stand up for you if needed.
GID00111913	Good luck with your relationship then. You'll probably need it.
GID00111914	You have a strong personality. I admire that. However, can it go on like this forever?
GID00111923	I don't care about stupid rumors. That's why I'm talking to you.
GID00111943	If you have any spare ammo, now's the time to hand it over.
GID00111944	You should go chill downstairs. If things go south... Run.
GID00111946	I know this is a hard thing to ask... But I need you to stand and fight.
GID00111947	I know this is a hard thing to ask... but I need you to stand and fight.
GID00111951	Never mind, let's keep going.
GID00111962	I kinda saw it coming. I was caught off guard, but it was pretty obviously going to happen.
GID00111963	Maybe. We'll figure it out as we go.
GID00111965	I'd rather try not to think about it. Let's just get ready to get out of here.
GID00111971	You know, I don't like the idea of keeping control of everyone at once.
GID00111972	I'll talk to him. Don't worry about it.
GID00111973	Do you think you could take care of Jen for a while? She's... Pretty shaken up.
GID00111974	She was asleep when the transformer exploded. I don't think she knows her family is gone.
GID00111975	No, they didn't make it.
GID00111979	Yeah, thanks! You're a member of the team too, thanks for having my back!
GID00111980	Yeah, thanks! You're a member of the team too. Thanks for having my back!
GID00111981	Woah! What was that for?
GID00111982	Yeah, no, I mean, thanks. I like you a lot too... Always have.
GID00111983	No, I don't know. I don't do drama. What's up?
GID00111991	Well, it's totally true. I've liked you ever since we were kids and I beat you up in kindergarten.
GID00111993	Yeah. I know the rumours. I don't give a shit. I think it's cool.
GID00111994	Yeah. I know the rumours. I don't give a shit. I think it's cool.
GID00111995	So, yeah, take care!
GID00111996	It was okay, I'll be fine. Take care out there.
GID00111997	I'd...prefer it if you didn't do that again without written permission from, like, the grim reaper.
GID00111999	Hey! Now that you've seen me without my armor, what'd you think?
GID00112000	Hey! Now that you've seen me without my armor, what'd you think?
GID00112002	I have a feeling if I wasn't gimped, you'd think different of me.
GID00112003	I have a feeling if I wasn't gimped, you'd think different of me.
GID00112004	Haha, ha, yeah, awesome. Bye Jamie.
GID00112024	Hey, I'm pretty scared too, but we've got to stick together, okay?
GID00112025	Hey, I'm pretty scared too, but we've got to stick together, okay?
GID00112026	This area isn't safe, Jen. We need to go to the hydroponics lab.
GID00112027	[Lie] Sure, honey. That's where they went. Let's go get them.
GID00112028	Jen... That's where the survivors are putting up their last defense.
GID00112030	I have no idea. I'm in the dark, just like you. Everyone I've seen is dead.
GID00112031	Alright. Do you think you can fight if you need to?
GID00112032	Just come with me. We'll figure it out as we go. Stay behind me.
GID00112033	It's not safe up there. You should stay here and wait. I'll be right back.
GID00112034	This area isn't safe, Jen. We need to go to the hydroponics lab.
GID00112036	Just... stay here. I'm going to go explore and try to find out what's going on.
GID00112037	I don't give a fuck. I just wanted to see if you had anything of value. Later.
GID00112038	I'm sorry... I just lost mine too. But now I have your attention, let's talk about what happened.
GID00112039	Hey! I came down here to try to help you!
GID00112040	Nope. You're obviously of no value. I don't see why you should still live.
GID00112043	Uuugh! This wing of the vault is on fire! Pull it together!
GID00112044	Duh, probably beneath that pile of rocks. Now do you want my help or not?
GID00112045	I don't know. We should go looking for them.
GID00112047	Hey, I know you won't want to hear this... But Bragg has a special mission for you.
GID00112050	Hey, I know you won't want to hear this... But Bragg has a special mission for you.
GID00112058	I'm sorry, Jen. Look, maybe you should go wait in Jamie's room for a while.
GID00112059	Hey, it's okay. We'll get through this. I have something I want to ask.
GID00112088	I'm in. You follow me, understood?
GID00112089	You've always been crazy, but this jumps the shark. We need to talk our way out, not fight.
GID00112090	No friends, huh? Alright. Fine. Lets just leave it at that.
GID00112091	Ruined you? Ha! Nope. The best part of you ran down your momma's ass. I just broke your knee.
GID00112092	Look, I don't have time for this. I need to find a way out of here.
GID00112093	Look, I don't have time for this. I need to find a way out of here.
GID00112094	Look, I don't have time for this.
GID00112095	Oh. Great job, Matheson. You're alive.
GID00112097	What the hell are you talking about, Johnny? I just saved your life!
GID00112098	I AM - have you not been listening to the insane firefight going on upstairs?
GID00112099	Wow! You are a total douchebag. There are over a hundred people dead, and you're acting like a dick.
GID00112100	I bet you won't talk so tough when I stuff your ass in that locker.
GID00112101	I bet you won't talk so tough when I stuff your ass in that locker.
GID00112102	I bet you won't talk so tough when I stuff your ass in that locker.
GID00112103	Are you on crack? You'd have to be, to think harassing your liberator is a good idea.
GID00112104	Are you on crack? You'd have to be, to think harassing your liberator is a good idea.
GID00112105	Are you on crack? You'd have to be, to think harassing your liberator is a good idea.
GID00112106	Look, just get out of my face, alright?
GID00112107	Oh. Great. Matheson.
GID00112111	Killed four of the bastards!
GID00112113	You managed to tackle me was because you're using chems, Johnny. I can tell from looking at you.
GID00112114	You managed to tackle me was because you're using chems, Johnny. I can tell from looking at you.
GID00112121	I know it doesn't help, but still, I want you to know I'm sorry.
GID00112122	Yeah, I guess so. That's too bad.
GID00112123	Well, short-sighted assholes who can't plan two steps ahead usually run into this sort of issue.
GID00112124	You could always switch over to something a bit more intellectual than sports, you know?
GID00112125	I'm sure you'll find something to do.
GID00112126	Well, it's not so bad, Johnny. It's not like you did jack shit before, anyway.
GID00112127	Sorry, I just thought you'd appreciate the joke. It wasn't supposed to be hurtful.
GID00112128	Eh, I'd like to hear you do better, Johnny.
GID00112129	Judging by how badly I crippled you with that one tackle, fuck yeah, asshole. More of one than you.
GID00112184	Probably not. I'll just... be over here... doing something.
GID00112185	Probably not. I'll just... be over here... doing something.
GID00112186	Damn girl, what a big bitch you have! I'm just sayin' fuckin' hello.
GID00112187	I... won the big game tonight? Does that count?
GID00112189	Yeah. I have my eye on hacking Maria over there. Just for fun.
GID00112190	Yeah. I have my eye on hacking Maria over there. Just for fun.
GID00112191	Probably not. I'll just... be over here... doing something.
GID00112192	Probably not. I'll just... be over here... doing something.
GID00112250	All right, you're good. Let's get out of here.
GID00112251	Stay close to me.
GID00112254	Enough about tactics.
GID00112255	Relax here for awhile.
GID00112289	I shot him. He was a threat to us all, and wasted my time.
GID00112300	The vault reactor is set to self-destruct! We have to get out of here, NOW!
GID00112302	Oh, you're one of them. What are you people doing out here?
GID00112303	Oh, you're one of them  what are you people doing out here?
GID00112305	Out for a walk? What do you think, douchebag!?
GID00112312	Christianson shot himself. He set the self-destruct.
GID00112313	But how do we activate the main vault door? Aren't we trapped?
GID00112316	Anything else I should know?
GID00112317	Did you see Bragg try to get back up after he died?
GID00112318	Got it. I'm on my way to see Christianson.
GID00112328	I followed Dr. Rossman's trail through the cistern. I heard you need help?
GID00112329	I'm sure. We secured the upper apartments before I left. What's going on here?
GID00112330	Where did Dr. Rossman go?
GID00112331	Where did Dr. Rossman Go?
GID00112332	Is Overseer Christianson alright?
GID00112333	I'll do what I can. You just make sure our backs are safe. No more of my friends die today.
GID00112334	Great. Sounds like a good old-fashioned fire fight. What should I do?
GID00112336	Well that's not good. These doors were built to melt under arc from those torches.
GID00112347	Did you mention Jane Kowalski? The Firearms and Marksmanship instructor?
GID00112348	You don't like being the vault medical doctor, do you?
GID00112349	This is all that stupid scoring computer's fault! I told Coach Bragg it was setting me up!
GID00112350	The Generalized Occupational Aptitude Test told me I should try?
GID00112351	I... I just wanted to be more popular. I hate being called a nerd.
GID00112352	Okay, so cut to the chase, Poindexter. When can I get back on my feet?
GID00112353	For god's sake, let me take a look at it.
GID00112354	You really don't like Coach Bragg, do you?
GID00112355	What am I supposed to do now that I can't be an athlete?
GID00112356	Oh fuck off, Rossman, just patch me up so I can go on with my miserable life.
GID00112357	I won't be gimped for long, old man.
GID00112360	Thank you, sir!
GID00112361	Um... Sorry, sir. I mean, right! Yes, Coach!
GID00112362	Right, Coach. Sorry to interrupt.
GID00112363	Whatever. Can I go now?
GID00112364	I'm proud to have done it. I enjoy making my vault proud!
GID00112365	You mean you don't concede your will to our benevolent and fair corporate Overseers from Vault-Tec?
GID00112366	Hell yeah! I've always wanted to be part of Vault Security.
GID00112367	I don't think so, Coach. I'm not really a fighter, I'm more of technical person.
GID00112368	Well, I've had better moments. Johnny's a puss. I'm surprised the gym lights didn't knock him over.
GID00112369	You mean, you don't concede your will to our benevolent and fair corporate Overseers from Vault-Tec?
GID00112370	Hell yeah! Vault Security is where I've always wanted to be.
GID00112371	I don't think so, Coach. I'm not really a fighter, I'm more of technical person.
GID00112372	I need to get going, Coach.
GID00112373	Not much to tell, honest. Lived in Vault 18 my whole life... I'm adopted, like everyone else...
GID00112374	Yeah, absolutely! What threat are you talking about?
GID00112375	Yes, Coach, I understand clearly. I'm ready for that responsibility.
GID00112376	I don't know if you've noticed, but 'Merika is dead for a reason, Sergeant Nasty.
GID00112377	Look, I'd rather not waste my time. I'm a jock, not a bullet sponge.
GID00112378	My country? You mean the vault? Sure. A few extra hours won't hurt.
GID00112379	Hell, what's this about, Bragg? I'm tired of this school bullshit.
GID00112380	I'm just your average athlete, Coach, just looking out for my home.
GID00112381	I don't need to make you my pal, Bragg. Fuck off.
GID00112383	I want to hear what you know about the Wasteland.
GID00112384	I want to hear what you know about the Wasteland.
GID00112385	I want to know what it's like. Out in the wastes.
GID00112386	I want to talk about America. What is your plan for it?
GID00112388	I have to go. Thanks for the talk, Coach.
GID00112390	Do you have any more books on fighting, Coach?
GID00112391	Do you have any more books on fighting, Coach?
GID00112393	I want to know if there is any "special" training you can give me.
GID00112394	I want to know if there is any "special" training you can give me.
GID00112398	Never mind, sir.
GID00112400	It says I'm a strong athlete, and have the ability to perform my duties!
GID00112401	It says I'm a strong athlete, and have the ability to perform my duties!
GID00112403	It says I'm right for leadership, and have a good mannerism.
GID00112404	It says I'm right for leadership, and have a good mannerism.
GID00112406	It says I have the endurance it takes to keep my head in the game!
GID00112407	It says I have the endurance it takes to keep my head in the game!
GID00112409	It says I can probably hack into any terminal in this vault.
GID00112410	It says I can probably hack into any terminal in this vault.
GID00112412	Yeah! Can I come in?
GID00112413	Hell yeah. I'm here to pick up a gun, king.
GID00112418	Understood.
GID00112419	But what's in it?
GID00112422	&pcname;, but everyone calls me Star.
GID00112423	&pcname;, but everyone calls me, Star
GID00112424	Yo, bitch, just call me Star.
GID00112425	Wait, what? That's it?
GID00112426	&pcname;, ma'am.
GID00112487	Uuuuuuum....
GID00112489	Was, that an invitation to bang your daughter, sir?
GID00112490	Was, that an invitation to bang your daughter, sir?
GID00112491	Um... I guess that could be fun, but... the whole girl thing is...
GID00112495	Sure. Where are we going?
GID00112496	Nah. Jen, I'm really sleepy. I should just crash to bed. Thanks though.
GID00112507	Yeah, when you mentioned your room, I wasn't expecting--
GID00112509	A list?
GID00112511	So... What do you want me to do?
GID00112513	Huh. Well, I'll check into it. I'll be right back.
GID00112515	Listen, I'm pretty proof-positive that Bragg hates me. I'm like on his Z list. Is there another way?
GID00112516	Sure. Where are we going?
GID00112517	Nah. Jen, I'm really sleepy. I should just crash to bed. Thanks though.
GID00112519	I'm not a really big fan of Coach Bragg, or his crazy sister.
GID00112523	So, you broke into one of Bragg's crates, and just took this?
GID00112526	What have you been using these Stealth Boys for, Jen?
GID00112527	What have you been using these Stealth Boys for, Jen?
GID00112528	What are we looking for when we get in there?
GID00112529	Well, I should probably switch into quieter clothes, but let's go.
GID00112530	Hey - I'm from the wasteland too. Am I not to be trusted?
GID00112532	Yeah. It's just a list of names. Not too exciting. I forwarded it to your computer.
GID00112533	Alright, see you there. I've got some stuff to take care of first, though.
GID00112534	Not likely. I think you're a little too blonde to say anything of value.
GID00112537	StarPlayer: Hello?
GID00112538	StarPlayer: Um... My name is &pcname;. Who are you?
GID00112539	[Science] StarPlayer: Um... Hello Annai. I'm kind of a computer nerd, I guess? What is this?
GID00112540	StarPlayer: Oh, that's cool. I just found it by plugging in some cables and stuff.
GID00112541	StarPlayer: How do you have a dating service when the whole computer network was blown to hell?
GID00112542	StarPlayer: Oh. So, the NCR is building a computer network along these old server lines?
GID00112543	StarPlayer: Then why did you choose to call it Brazil, if it's not in that country?
GID00112544	StarPlayer: Nooo000 \/\/hi are brazil if n0t BR@Z1L!!!!111?11!one
GID00112545	StarPlayer: BR@Z1LBlalhalhahalag!!!!111?11!one
GID00112547	StarPlayer: Ah, okay, I get it. Let's get back to important things - like me and u. ;)
GID00112548	StarPlayer: Ah, okay, i get it. Let's get back to important things - like me and u. ;)
GID00112550	StarPlayer: Ah, ok, I get it. Let's get back to important things, like learning about our cultures.
GID00112551	StarPlayer: Ah, ok, i get it. Let's get back to important things, like learning about our cultures.

GID00112633	He called himself "Enclave". What is that?
GID00112634	Well... now we know there's life on the moon base?
GID00112635	I found a ton of old history reports from the weeks after the Great War.
GID00112636	Nothing, just some old notes and letters. Ancient grocery lists, basically.
GID00112637	Just a bunch of security logs and data from a few years ago. Stuff about the Exodites.
GID00112638	Nothing, just a lot of pre-war news clippings and dime novels.
GID00112639	I fixed the third-tier networks!
GID00112640	Actually, I found parts of the old external network still working outside Vault 18.
GID00112641	Nothing, just a bunch of empty advertising bullshit from before the war.
GID00112642	I dunno. It was the only option they gave me. Democracy, right?
GID00112643	Eh. It's just some meaningless task. Why not.
GID00112644	I'll go have a look then.
GID00112645	Nah, I'd rather just go to bed.
GID00112646	Just, trying to learn the layout of things. Exploring is what I do.
GID00112647	Are there any, you know, secret passages I should know about?
GID00112648	Oh. Well, can you tell me why some parts of Vault 18 were never finished?
GID00112649	This is the filter room, right? Where do we get all of our water from?
GID00112650	Why is it so dark in here?
GID00112651	Okay. Cool. Later Joe!
GID00112652	Meh. I just want to wander.
GID00112653	Hey, what is that weird mess of radio parts and the jukebox in the storage cell for?
GID00112654	Later Joe!
GID00112664	Who are you?
GID00112667	I can deal with this. This is easy.
GID00112668	I can deal with this. This is easy.
GID00112670	I think I understand. This is a dream. Something is very wrong.
GID00112671	I think I understand. This is a dream. Something is very wrong.
GID00112673	I'm dreaming. I think I know you from my past... or my future.
GID00112674	I'm dreaming. I think I know you from my past... or my future.
GID00112676	I think you are testing me. I will perform this task adequately.
GID00112678	I must go.
GID00112686	I want you to attack enemies the moment you see them.
GID00112687	I don't want you to attack enemies unless I've already engaged them.
GID00112688	On second thought, stick with me for a little longer.
GID00112689	Yes, I'm sure.
GID00112691	I think we should travel together.
GID00112692	Let's talk about your tactics.
GID00112693	I want you to change your combat style.
GID00112694	Let's talk about something else.
GID00112695	That's all. Let's get going.
GID00112696	Switch to a melee weapon.
GID00112697	I want you to use ranged weapons.
GID00112698	Let's talk about how close you're following me.
GID00112699	Stay close to me.
GID00112700	Your distance is good. Let's talk about something else.
GID00112701	All right, you're good. Let's get out of here.
GID00112702	Keep your distance. Try to flank them.
GID00112729	Idle Chatter
GID00112730	I'm gonna head to bed in a bit. Have a good night, babe.
GID00112731	Eh, whatever.
GID00112732	Never mind.
GID00112733	Ha, thanks Jamie.
GID00112734	I am the Lord your God, master of advanced technology! Kneel before your master!
GID00112735	Shit!
GID00112736	Relax here for awhile.
GID00112737	Relax here for a while.
GID00112738	It wasn't shit, I'm all about winning.
GID00112739	Relax here for awhile.
GID00112740	Relax here for awhile.
GID00112741	Relax here for a while.
GID00112742	I just want to pester you. Until you like me. A lot.
GID00112743	Relax here for a while.
GID00112745	What is this cliche cryptic bullshit? I hope I'm not dreaming, I'd be disappointed in my creativity.

GID00112752	Let's trade equipment.
GID00112753	I need to get going.
GID00112754	Can you repair my weapon?
GID00112755	Could you use this stimpak on me? I think you might be more qualified to use it than I am.
GID00112756	Let's trade equipment.
