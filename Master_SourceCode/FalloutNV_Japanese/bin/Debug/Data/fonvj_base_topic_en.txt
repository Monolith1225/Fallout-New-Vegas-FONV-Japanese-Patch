GID00057310	I'd like you to come with me.
GID00057311	What do you think the others will do at Hoover Dam?
GID00057312	[PRESS DEMO] Enough gambling, more fighting. Take me to the no man's land near Camp Forlorn Hope.
GID00057313	Cass isn't around anymore, so I won't be able to complete the negotiation for you.
GID00057314	Arcade asked me to find you. I'm reuniting the Remnants, and they'll need your piloting skills.
GID00057315	Arcade asked me to find you. I'm finding the Remnants, and you can fly.
GID00057316	Arcade and I were looking for you. We're gathering the Remnants.
GID00057317	Arcade sent me to look for you. I'm gathering the Remnants.
GID00057318	Do you know anything about Corporal White?
GID00057319	I'm still working on the Boomers.
GID00057320	The cannibals among the White Glove Society are dead.
GID00057321	The White Glove Society has agreed to an alliance with Caesar's Legion.
GID00057322	There's no way the White Glove Society will be cannibals again - I've already seen to that.
GID00057323	I'm still working on the White Glove Society.
GID00057324	I had to wipe out the Boomers' leaders.
GID00057325	I've won over the Boomers. They'll do as I say.
GID00057326	Look, I take advantage of the NCR, too, but I don't make them my enemy.
GID00057327	I've brought new security codes for this station's radio from Sergeant Reyes.
GID00057328	I've brought radio security code updates from Sergeant Reyes at Camp Forlorn Hope.
GID00057329	I have updated radio security codes from Sergeant Reyes here.
GID00057330	I brought updated radio security codes from Camp Forlorn Hope.
GID00057331	I need to confirm your report about Great Khans with trained Deathclaws.
GID00057332	The bottle cap press is no longer a problem.
GID00057333	Contreras sent me. McCarran needs a lot more guns and ammo.
GID00057334	I delivered the invoice, just as you asked.
GID00057335	Delivered that thing you wanted me to deliver.
GID00057336	The Crimson Caravan Company no longer has to worry about Henry Jamison.
GID00057337	Henry Jamison is fired.
GID00057338	Cassidy Caravans has been bought out, and is now part of the Crimson Caravan Company.
GID00057339	I bought Cassidy Caravans for you.
GID00057340	I have the Gun Runner holotape.
GID00057341	I've brought a brain to transplant into Rex.
GID00057342	I'll need 2500 caps to pay the mercenaries.
GID00057343	I'm a hero in the NCR, and I think you need to leave. Now.
GID00057344	Show me what you have for sale.
GID00057345	Arcade asked me to gather all the remaining members of the Enclave in the Mojave.
GID00057346	Arcade asked me to find you. I'm gathering the Remnants.
GID00057347	I'm looking for an antique rangefinder somebody might've sold to you?
GID00057348	I've already reverted the White Glove Society back to cannibalism.
GID00057349	I'll handle the Boomers for you.
GID00057350	[Speech]
GID00057351	When the Legion attacks Hoover Dam, the Brotherhood will attack HELIOS One.
GID00057352	When we attack the dam the Brotherhood will rise from their bunker to conquer HELIOS One!
GID00057353	I'll eliminate Mr. House for you.
GID00057354	I've already wiped out the Boomers' leadership.
GID00057355	I've already won over the Boomers. They'll do as I say.
GID00057356	I'll see what I can work out with the White Glove Society.
GID00057357	I've already destroyed the Brotherhood's bunker in Hidden Valley.
GID00057358	I've destroyed the Brotherhood of Steel's bunker in Hidden Valley.
GID00057359	I'll kill President Kimball for you.
GID00057360	Where's the Platinum Chip?
GID00057361	What's going on with the Great Khans?
GID00057362	I know what you and your partner have been up to - I got the evidence from your rooms.
GID00057363	Back rubs are a specialty of mine. Maybe I'll show you sometime.
GID00057364	You might be interested to know that I killed a fiend named Cook-Cook.
GID00057365	I've done all I can. Let's take over Goodsprings.
GID00057366	Ringo's dead. What now?
GID00057367	So what's next for you guys?
GID00057368	I'm just having a look around.
GID00057369	< Science 25 >
GID00057370	There may be data corruption in one of your memory chips. Let me take a look.
GID00057371	Maybe something's broken in one of your computer parts. Let me take a look.
GID00057372	I'm trying to convince Corporal Betsy to go see a doctor. Any ideas?
GID00057373	Betsy needs to go see a doctor. Where's a doctor?
GID00057374	Any ideas on how to convince Corporal Betsy to go see a doctor?
GID00057375	Any ideas on how to convince Corporal Betsy to go see a doctor?
GID00057376	Major Dhatri said I should talk to you about taking down Driver Nephi.
GID00057377	Any ideas on how to convince Corporal Betsy to go see a doctor?
GID00057378	I'm trying to get Corporal Betsy to go see a doctor. I heard you saw Usanagi yourself.
GID00057379	What do you need done?
GID00057380	You've got trouble. The NCR are planning a raid on this place soon.
GID00057381	Chavez has been dealt with. You won't see him around here anymore.
GID00057382	I got rid of him.
GID00057383	The merchant was a bunny hunter. Got rid of him.
GID00057384	How would you feel about becoming Primm's new sheriff?
GID00057385	President Kimball is dead.
GID00057386	President Kimball survived the assassination attempt.
GID00057387	After everything I've done for the Legion, this one failure condemns me?
GID00057388	I've done lots of help and stuff for you. I don't do good once and you hate me?
GID00057389	I've brought a doctor, Arcade Gannon, who can take care of Caesar. He's outside.
GID00057390	President Kimball survived. His visit to the Hoover Dam was cancelled.
GID00057391	About Hoover Dam...
GID00057392	How do you know about Benny?
GID00057393	Who are you?
GID00057394	You again? How'd you find me here?
GID00057395	You'd better leave while you can. The Powder Gangers won't fall for your trick.
GID00057396	Have a look at this book. If you want to see what your tribe could be, read about the Mongol Empire.
GID00057397	All of the Ranger stations have been given the new security codes.
GID00057398	Every station except Charlie has been given the new security codes. Charlie was wiped out.
GID00057399	What else did you need me to do?
GID00057400	I've come to ask the Great Khans to break their alliance with Caesar's Legion.
GID00057402	Have a look at this book. It will show you what happens to tribes that "ally" with Caesar's Legion.
GID00057403	I'd like to talk more about the Great Khans' alliance with Caesar.
GID00057404	What's your opinion of the NCR?
GID00057405	I want to talk to you about the fate of the Great Khans.
GID00057406	Now that you're in command, will you lead the Khans against Caesar and fight for the NCR?
GID00057407	I'm here to ask you to publicly oppose Papa Khan's alliance with Caesar.
GID00057408	Doctor Henry sent me. I need a new brain for my cyber-dog.
GID00057409	Let's talk about Rey's brain.
GID00057410	I've been told you're someone I should talk to about stopping the Khans' alliance with Caesar.
GID00057411	So, about the alliance with Caesar's Legion....
GID00057412	So, about the alliance with Caesar's Legion....
GID00057413	I'm looking for a suitcase filled with chemical supplies for a... friend. Know anything?
GID00057414	Something's wrong with my cyber-dog. I was told to come to you.
GID00057415	Ending Slideshow Setup.
GID00057416	I heard Corporal White came here to investigate a water shortage.
GID00057417	Hector told me everything.
GID00057418	I could use Lupa's brain to fix my cyber-dog.
GID00057419	I'm ready to fight Lupa.
GID00057420	What did you need help with?
GID00057421	I got Sergeant Teddy - he's a little chewed up.
GID00057422	Okay. Let's fight.
GID00057425	Caesar wishes to extend your society an offer of alliance with his Legion.
GID00057428	Who are you?
GID00057429	If you're looking for work, Tommy Torini is hiring singers at the Tops.
GID00057430	Have you seen Benny?
GID00057431	When's the last time you saw Benny?
GID00057432	Sergeant Reyes sent me here. I've got a security update for your radio.
GID00057433	What are you doing here?
GID00057434	I've got evidence!
GID00057435	Who are you?
GID00057436	What do you need help with?
GID00057437	Show me what you have for sale.
GID00057438	Show me what you have for sale.
GID00057439	I hear you've got dynamite. It would help us beat the powder gangers.
GID00057440	Did you know there's a man named Joe Cobb looking for you?
GID00057441	What are you going to do about the Powder Gangers?
GID00057442	Show me what you have for sale.
GID00057443	I'm going to help Ringo take on the powder gangers. I might need your help.
GID00057444	What say I help you take over this town?
GID00057445	A man named Joe Cobb was looking for you, but I killed him.
GID00057446	Are you decent in a fight? I could use more firepower, if you have any.
GID00057447	I have an update on Corporal White.
GID00057448	Major Dhatri said I should ask you about Cook-Cook.
GID00057449	I want to claim a bounty.
GID00057451	I'd like to see what you have for sale.
GID00057453	I figure a guy like you gets his pick of killing gear.
GID00057454	A gun nut like you must have some weapons stashed around here.
GID00057455	Let me see what you have for sale.
GID00057456	Anything else I should know?
GID00057457	Um... Where the hell did you come from?
GID00057458	I found Argyle. I'm afraid he's dead.
GID00057461	So what's your take on this whole situation?
GID00057464	I'll need 2000 caps to pay off the mercenaries.
GID00057465	Why are the Powder Gangers out to get you?
GID00057466	Any ideas on how to convince Trudy to join us?
GID00057467	The Boomers will come when I call them.
GID00057468	The Boomer leadership has been neutralized.
GID00057469	Have a look at this book. Your tribe is nothing but a bunch of thugs, aping the glories of the past.
GID00057470	PC asks about the Nightkin
GID00057471	Tell me more about these "demons."
GID00057472	You say one of the demons "raved" at you?
GID00057473	About those "demons"...
GID00057474	<Lie> I'll need 3000 caps to pay off the mercenaries.
GID00057475	Would Chet be willing to give us his supplies?
GID00057476	I destroyed the Brotherhood of Steel.
GID00057477	The Brotherhood of Steel will aid us against the NCR.
GID00057478	You don't need to look outward, mighty Khan. Your tribe is proud and strong - claim your own glory!
GID00057479	Who cares about glory? Better to live without glory than die pointlessly, if you ask me.
GID00057480	I changed my mind - I'll help you with your mercenary problem.
GID00057481	You won't have any more trouble with those mercenaries.
GID00057482	How can I get Easy Pete's dynamite?
GID00057483	The White Glove Society is now an ally of the Legion.
GID00057484	I wasn't able to get the support of the White Glove Society.
GID00057485	What great legacy do the Great Khans have? Your tribe is nothing but ghosts and martyrs.
GID00057486	Any idea where I might look to find such inspiration from the past?
GID00057488	I'm looking for Doctor Henry.
GID00057489	I'm going to find a non-violent solution to your Ghoul problem.
GID00057490	What do you think I should do about ED-E? Brotherhood or Followers?
GID00057491	I'd like to exchange caps for chips.
GID00057492	The NCR thinks pretty highly of me. Let's say I get word to your parents...
GID00057493	Do you have enough scrap metal yet?
GID00057494	Mind if I take some of those extra medical supplies?
GID00057495	You'll have to find someone else for the Gun Runner job. That's not something I do.
GID00057496	Here's your money - 2500 caps.
GID00057497	What kind of implants do you have available?
GID00057498	You sell plants, too?
GID00057499	I want to buy an implant.
GID00057500	Is it really necessary to destroy the Brotherhood?
GID00057501	I'm not going to kill the NCR's President.
GID00057502	I hear you were a slave of Caesar's Legion.
GID00057503	It was easy to figure out that the NCR water shortage points to you - save me some time, will you?
GID00057504	I found this teddy bear in your partner's room. Strange, don't you think?
GID00057505	Take a look at this ledger I found in Dermot's room.
GID00057506	The Powder Gangers need you to donate some supplies to them.
GID00057507	Here - the spare medical supplies from Doc Mitchell.
GID00057508	What's the point of freeing the Bighorners?
GID00057509	The Bighorners are loose.
GID00057510	< Speech 25 >
GID00057511	You should help me take down the powder gang. Bullets, explosions, lots of fun.
GID00057512	Uh, we're a little outnumbered against the powder gang. Think you could help?
GID00057513	What happens if I help Ringo?
GID00057514	So I help Ringo, and Goodsprings will like me more. What if I help the Powder Gangers?
GID00057515	You should get medical help for your trauma.
GID00057516	< Medicine 40 >
GID00057517	Mental trauma can slow you down or distract you, but it's treatable - just like any bullet wound.
GID00057518	Just get the help. You'll feel better, I promise.
GID00057519	Doctor Usanagi at the New Vegas Medical Clinic can help you.
GID00057520	Who's in charge of the prison now?
GID00057521	Show me what you have for sale.
GID00057522	Why does Caesar want to see me?
GID00057523	Traveling a little light for a merchant, aren't you? No pack Brahmin?
GID00057524	< Speech 30 >
GID00057525	Even if you managed to kill me, the Powder Gangers are already on to you. It's why I'm here.
GID00057526	So, there's no official bounty? Waste of time, if you ask me. Better walk away while you can.
GID00057527	< Speech 30 >
GID00057528	A real merchant would be much more worried about Powder Gangers, you know.
GID00057529	You sure you're actually a merchant?
GID00057530	Do you have any thrust control modules from REPCONN in stock?
GID00057531	Looking for rocket parts. Uh... thrust models or something. Got any?
GID00057532	About those thrust control modules...
GID00057533	About those thrust models...
GID00057534	I repaired your generator.
GID00057535	I have a new brain for Rex.
GID00057536	I've dealt with the attacks on the camp. They won't be a problem any more.
GID00057537	I found your attacker. There's a Great Khan hiding out in the mountains. I can lead your men there.
GID00057538	I'd like some healing powder.
GID00057539	I'd like to get Hadrian out of his contract.
GID00057540	I'm back to talk about Hadrian's contract.
GID00057541	Some people have gone missing, and they were last seen dealing with you.
GID00057542	The troopers are all dead. You're free to go.
GID00057543	Let's talk about settling things between you and the NCR.
GID00057544	How much money do you owe this Reaper guy?
GID00057545	You sound like you're eager to die.
GID00057546	I need supplies to fight the Powder Gangers.
GID00057547	I overheard your argument. What was that all about?
GID00057548	That guy looked mad. Something going on?
GID00057549	Do you know anything about the people who attacked me?
GID00057550	I've decided to kill you for Joe Cobb.
GID00057551	Doc Mitchell said you could teach me to survive in the desert.
GID00057552	I heard about what happened to Corporal Betsy.
GID00057553	Are you supposed to be famous or something?
GID00057554	I'd like to hear about your open bounties.
GID00057555	If I help you, is there some kind of reward?
GID00057556	I'm still looking, don't worry. I'll find him.
GID00057557	Let's discuss the facial reconstruction procedure you performed.
GID00057558	Ever do any facial surgery? Maybe on someone from the Commonwealth?
GID00057559	You know who might have a Lipoplasticator or Micro Dermal Graftilizer?
GID00057560	Let's discuss the facial reconstruction and mind wipe you did for the Android.
GID00057562	I'm in good with the Omertas - ask around. Feel like quitting yet?
GID00057563	Here's your money - 2000 caps, as we agreed.
GID00057564	You should know I've been helpful to the Followers, so come clean about White if you know something.
GID00057565	What makes the surplus ammo inferior?
GID00057566	Why is surplus ammo not good?
GID00057567	Who was that man you were arguing with?
GID00057568	< Sneak 25 >
GID00057569	Near the saloon and store are good spots to stage an ambush - if I had the help.
GID00057570	I could probably take out the powder gang by surprise, if I had help. Probably.
GID00057571	Are you all right?
GID00057572	< Speech 60 >
GID00057573	You're a weak link. I know it, you know it, and First Recon knows it. Do something about it.
GID00057574	Just get the help. People are worried about you.
GID00057575	Want me to take a look at your broken radio?
GID00057576	Can probably fix your broken stuff.
GID00057577	I fixed your radio.
GID00057578	The rest of First Recon all agree that you should go see Doctor Usanagi.
GID00057579	Arcade Gannon has asked me to gather all the former members of the Enclave in the Mojave.
GID00057580	What did you do when you were with the Enclave?
GID00057581	What makes this a "dangerous place?"
GID00057582	What's your opinion on the current situation?
GID00057583	Corporal Betsy from First Recon will be coming to you for mental treatment.
GID00057584	Corporal Betsy's coming to you to fix her brain. It's not working right.
GID00057585	I convinced her to pay you what you're owed. You're free to leave.
GID00057586	You're free to leave, but McLafferty won't pay you. That's the deal.
GID00057587	How did you like flying vertibirds for the Enclave?
GID00057588	Did you like flying for the Enclave?
GID00057589	Tell me about the old days with the Enclave.
GID00057590	Tell me about weapon mods and special ammo.
GID00057591	What's weapon mods? And why's the ammo special?
GID00057592	This area is your territory?
GID00057593	What's wrong with Betsy?
GID00057594	I can talk to Betsy about getting medical help for her trauma, if you want.
GID00057595	Uh... did you want me to help Betsy or something?
GID00057596	I convinced Corporal Betsy to get help from Doctor Usanagi.
GID00057597	I'm going to wear your head like you wear that dog's.
GID00057598	What can you tell me about this job? <Show Delivery Order>
GID00057599	I want to ask you some more about the delivery I was supposed to make.
GID00057600	Where can I get information on the man that shot me?
GID00057601	I'm a courier with the Mojave Express.
GID00057602	I lost a package I was supposed to deliver.
GID00057603	The Boomers hate me. They'll never follow my lead.
GID00057604	The White Glove Society won't listen to me - I've caused them too much trouble.
GID00057605	What was that about the surplus ammo?
GID00057606	What was that about McCarran?
GID00057607	Lenk told me her story.
GID00057608	<Lie> I'm here because of your debt to the Omertas. Pay me what you've got and you'll get more time.
GID00057609	Janet's asked me to talk to you about releasing her from her contract.
GID00057610	Contreras sent me for some medical supplies.
GID00057611	I've got some scrap for you.
GID00057612	< Speech 50 >
GID00057613	So you don't have the Omertas' money yet? I'll let them know about that.
GID00057614	I'll go talk to the Omertas about you, then. Unless you feel like quitting?
GID00057615	Do you have something against the NCR?
GID00057616	Been working here long?
GID00057617	Tell me about Pretty Sarah.
GID00057618	Aren't you kind of old to be doing this?
GID00057619	I'm interested in learning more about Dermot and Saint James.
GID00057620	How much does it cost to hire you?
GID00057621	Show me what you have for sale.
GID00057622	What is this place?
GID00057623	Can I go in?
GID00057624	Why are you called Scrambler?
GID00057625	I need something repaired.
GID00057626	< Speech 50 >
GID00057627	Caesar would be dead if I didn't try to help him. How dare you blame me for trying to save his life!
GID00057628	Hey, it totally wasn't my fault that he died. He was old.
GID00057629	You said Caesar has an offer for me. What kind of offer?
GID00057630	There's a bounty out on Powder Gangers?
GID00057631	Tilden mentioned you had surplus ammo. Mind if I have some?
GID00057632	What is it you do here?
GID00057633	I'd like to exchange NCR money for chips.
GID00057634	What's the story with Keene?
GID00057635	Doctor Henry wants Lily to continue wearing the prototype. What do you think?
GID00057636	Doctor Henry wants Lily to keep wearing the new Stealth thing. Is that bad?
GID00057637	< Speech - 65 >
GID00057638	Go away or you'll have to deal with me, and you'll wish you were fighting Super Mutants instead.
GID00057639	You should leave before I... get mad.
GID00057640	I'm here to talk to you about our new "business" arrangement.
GID00057641	I'm here for my "special" order.
GID00057642	I've been inside the Brotherhood's bunker, but I haven't destroyed it yet.
GID00057643	Won't killing President Kimball just anger the NCR?
GID00057644	How goes your research for the Nightkin cure?
GID00057645	I found a chewed up Stealth Boy in the Nightstalker lair.
GID00057646	I could look for the source of the Nightstalker mutation for you.
GID00057647	You should look at this. It's Karl's journal, and it's very revealing of his true opinions.
GID00057648	This is a ledger from Caesar's camp, showing what Karl really has planned for the Great Khans.
GID00057649	Show me what you have for sale.
GID00057650	Do you have a problem with humans?
GID00057651	I fixed Snuffles' leg.
GID00057652	How you feeling, boy?
GID00057653	The NCR troopers have been paid to look the other way.
GID00057654	Julie Farkas said a man in Jacobstown can treat Rex.
GID00057655	About Rex...
GID00057656	I need to get to Primm. Can you suggest a route?
GID00057657	I'm trying to track down the people who attacked me. Know anything about them?
GID00057658	Thanks for digging me out of that grave.
GID00057659	I'm here for Melody's bear.
GID00057660	Your howitzer is operational.
GID00057661	I'd like to fight in the arena.
GID00057662	You're a doctor?
GID00057663	Why does Caesar want to see me?
GID00057664	Earlier you mentioned another assignment?
GID00057665	Is that job in Freeside still available?
GID00057666	I've completed the Pacer job.
GID00057667	Uh, the King sort of got killed while I was working on that Freeside job.
GID00057668	I wanted to talk about the situation in Freeside.
GID00057669	I have an update on the Freeside situation.
GID00057670	Sergeant Reyes at Camp Forlorn Hope sent me with a security update for your radio.
GID00057671	Sgt. Reyes sent me - she's curious about the high casualties at this station.
GID00057672	I'm going to wear your head like you wear that dog's.
GID00057674	<Deposit your Sunset Sarsaparilla Stars in the slot.>
GID00057675	<Deposit your Sunset Sarsaparilla Stars in the slot.>

GID00057682	Who's Sergeant Dornan?
GID00057683	What do you know about Joe Cobb?
GID00057684	What was that you said about Ringo?
GID00057685	Ten of Spades. Where did you get that name?
GID00057686	I thought you should know. Cook-cook is dead.
GID00057687	Have you seen anything suspicious around here?
GID00057688	Why does Dhatri owe you caps?
GID00057689	Got any more open bounties?
GID00057691	Tell me about the Gun Runners.
GID00057693	What do you do?
GID00057695	So you're a Gun Runner?
GID00057697	What is your "medicine" and how do you take it off?
GID00057699	You sell *thoughts?*
GID00057700	I killed Junders Plunkett.
GID00057702	What's this "movement" you mentioned?
GID00057703	Did you say a city of Ghouls?
GID00057704	You mentioned something about GNR?
GID00057705	What can you tell me about the Mechanist?
GID00057706	Know anything else that could help me stop them?
GID00057707	Here's your 500 caps. I can go in now, right?
GID00057708	Andy, what happened? All this blood...
GID00057709	How about a haircut?
GID00057711	What do you know about these Super Mutants?
GID00057712	Virginia? Virginia's been gone for 200 years.
GID00057713	Old Man Harris doesn't seen very happy.
GID00057714	I need your help, doc.
GID00057715	What did you do when you were with the Enclave?
GID00057716	What happened to the Enclave oil rig and Navarro?
GID00057717	How long have you been a sharpshooter?
GID00057718	So, you're good at shooting stuff?
GID00057720	You make it sound like avoiding innocent deaths was uncommon in the Enclave.
GID00057721	I'd like to know more about your former squad.
GID00057722	When did you enlist in the military?
GID00057723	When did you become an army guy?
GID00057724	Tell me about yourself.
GID00057725	McCarran needs a regular shipment of brahmin meat and spices for the mess hall.
GID00057726	Do you think Lily should continue to wear the Mark II prototype?
GID00057727	Who's the other human you mentioned?
GID00057728	I had some questions about Jacobstown.
GID00057729	< Barter - 55 >
GID00057730	2500 caps? I'm doing you a favor by paying you now. I doubt you were expected to survive this.
GID00057731	2500 caps is too much. Can't we come to a deal on a lower price?
GID00057732	You were a pilot?
GID00057733	What do you do in Westside?
GID00057734	What do you do around here?
GID00057735	So what did you do before you were retired?
GID00057736	I know how the Westside farmers have been getting their water.
GID00057737	I'll destroy the Brotherhood.
GID00057738	I'd like your services.
GID00057739	Let's have sex.
GID00057740	You work for Pretty Sarah?
GID00057741	You were a prospector - like digging for gold and silver?

GID00057744	You're a trader?

GID00057752	Why are you called Easy Pete?
GID00057753	Did you ever find anything good while prospecting?
GID00057754	I'm a little short on caps. I don't suppose there's any work available?
GID00057755	Do you know the robot that rescued me?
GID00057756	Who's the big robot thing that saved me?
GID00057757	Tell me again what you know about the target.
GID00057758	Have you ever met Caesar?
GID00057759	Is there anything that you need me to do?
GID00057760	Tell me more about the arena.
GID00057761	About the effectiveness of your healing powders...
GID00057762	Sgt. McCredie asked me to talk to you about getting your squad in shape.
GID00057763	How's the squad doing?
GID00057764	I got you the stuff.
GID00057765	I think you'll find that the Misfits' records are now much improved.
GID00057766	How's that human niceness working out?
GID00057767	So, did the shooting range practice take care of things?
GID00057768	So, did the shooting range practice take care of things?
GID00057769	So, did the grenade range practice take care of things?
GID00057770	So, about those improvements....
GID00057771	About getting the squad's readiness reports up....
GID00057772	Going back to those squad improvements, I had an idea.
GID00057773	I thought about what you said about basic human niceness.
GID00057774	Who's the merchandise?
GID00057775	Um... merchandise. What? You lost me.
GID00057776	I take it you're from Klamath?
GID00057777	You served in the military?
GID00057778	What do you do around here?
GID00057779	Interesting rifle you have there. Lever-action, right?

GID00057802	Is there anything else you need me to do?
GID00057803	Show me what you have for sale.

GID00057814	How did you all break out?
GID00057815	< Medicine 50 >
GID00057816	The cranial bleeding was too much for a man of his age. A younger man would have lived.
GID00057817	There was, uh, internal bleeding and lesions and other problems.
GID00057818	If this is a trap, I'm going to take a lot of you with me.

GID00057843	I was able to convince the Omerta thugs that crossing the Legion was unwise.
GID00057844	Martina's dead.

GID00057857	Have you always been with the First Recon?
GID00057858	I've been known to hunt a few bounties, myself.
GID00057859	Not too friendly, are you?
GID00057860	Who are you?
GID00057861	I've changed my mind. I want to choose a different bounty.
GID00057862	Crandon said you might have a problem I could help with. Something delicate.
GID00057863	What would you like me to do?
GID00057864	Got any more work for me?
GID00057865	Anything else you'd like me to do?
GID00057866	That's some impressive weaponry. Where did it all come from?
GID00057868	You don't sell that junk behind you?
GID00057870	Who are you?
GID00057871	This is Powder Ganger territory, and there's a toll. Pay up.
GID00057872	What about human slaves? Don't you try to help them, too?
GID00057873	You're crazy to stand out here! Aren't you afraid of the Super Mutants?

GID00057894	I don't suppose you know my father? A doctor from Vault 101?
GID00057896	Are you the Legion's second-in-command?
GID00057897	(Lie) A messenger?... Why, yes! Of course, Mr. House and I go way, waaaay back.
GID00057898	(Lie) Of course I act on behalf of Mr. House. Why else would I be here?
GID00057900	Where are your parents, kid? Are you here all alone?
GID00057901	For the love of God... Shut the hell up!
GID00057902	Tell me about the Burned Man.

GID00058031	How did you get inside there?
GID00058032	Why did you quit the trade?

GID00058064	If this android "wandered" off, why would he want a new mind and face?
GID00058065	Have you thought about disarming the bomb?
GID00058066	Why would an android feel guilt? Come on, Zimmer, what aren't you telling me?
GID00058067	Okay, so if others have escaped... why are you coming after this one?

GID00058220	Are you seriously going to make your "Great Journey" on those rockets?
GID00058221	Are these surface-to-surface rockets? Or will they launch you into orbit?
GID00058222	Those rockets will convey you and your flock straight into the ground!
GID00058223	Bullshit. A mugger in the Wasteland? A real Raider would have shot me already.
GID00058224	That gun doesn't look loaded.
GID00058225	Tell me about North Vegas.
GID00058226	How about I give you 5 caps and you leave me alone?
GID00058227	I'll try to remember that.

GID00058258	Who are you?
GID00058260	So what are you doing sticking around here?
GID00058261	No, but it's worth 50 caps.
GID00058262	I could see giving you 50 caps, maybe.

GID00058267	Um, tell me free or... I mean, can't you just tell me? Please?
GID00058268	I'm pretty sure that an actual spy would be more... discreet.

GID00058326	Did you know the Wests are dead?
GID00058327	Are you sure I can't just have that key, handsome? You know, as a present?
GID00058328	I'm looking for someone.
GID00058329	I'm investigating someone else. A man. And he just recently went missing.
GID00058332	Who is Jason?
GID00058334	Have you heard any interesting gossip?
GID00058336	All right. I haven't killed anyone all day. Let's go.
GID00058337	Huh. A robot stuck in a diagnostic loop. Curious.
GID00058338	It's probably just a problem in a subroutine somewhere. No sweat.
GID00058339	Wait here.
GID00058340	Why are you always working on such weird ideas?
GID00058341	Look, I'm not a threat to this place. Just let me go.
GID00058344	Who's your owner, rust bucket?
GID00058345	What is this place?
GID00058350	Send power to the Fort.
GID00058351	I want this dam out of operation.
GID00058352	Is this because I didn't upgrade that army of Securitrons under Caesar's Fort?
GID00058364	I thought you were dead.
GID00058365	Guess I owe you an apology for wrecking you the last time we talked.
GID00058366	I can keep killing you, if that's what you want.
GID00058367	Let's talk about something else.
GID00058369	I've helped out around here, sending troops to Primm will fortify the NCR in the region.
GID00058370	Earlier you said something about asking the Followers to provide medical aid?
GID00058371	Astor says there's a Ranger Station up north.
GID00058373	You wanted to ask me something before, when we left Ranger Andy's.
GID00058375	You seemed like you wanted to say something about Loyal.
GID00058377	You wanted to say something about Corporal Sterling before?
GID00058378	Any other work?
GID00058379	I already took care of Jackson. Er, the Jackson problem.
GID00058380	He's... gone, don't think he can help. Anything else?
GID00058381	I took care of Jackson. Er, the Jackson problem.
GID00058382	Fine, let's deal with this the old-fashioned way.
GID00058383	Uh... Jackson? He can't help us, he's... gone.
GID00058384	I don't think Jackson can help us with the Caravan evidence.
GID00058388	What's going on in Primm?
GID00058389	I can take care of myself.
GID00058390	Thanks for the warning.
GID00058391	Shouldn't you be protecting the town or something?
GID00058392	Why can't you protect them?
GID00058393	Where did it come from?
GID00058394	What is wrong with it?
GID00058395	Do you mind if I try to fix it?
GID00058396	I have some questions about ED-E.
GID00058397	Where did it come from?
GID00058398	Did you ever hear it say anything odd?
GID00058399	Any idea what I should do with it?
GID00058402	So... maize, 2 mutfruits, yeast, and a... uh... fission battery? Next time, maybe.
GID00058404	The President's visit was cancelled. I never got the opportunity to attack him.
GID00058406	Forget the Omertas. They're more trouble than they're worth.

GID00058415	I'm honored.
GID00058416	Thanks, I guess.

GID00058418	Moreno was a lost cause, but at least the others made it.
GID00058423	Is the Enclave's treatment by the Brotherhood influencing your opinion?
GID00058424	Why not the Brotherhood?

GID00058512	I never hired ED-E.
GID00058513	You're assuming a motive without evidence. Please be rational.
GID00058514	It's cleaner this way, without bringing NCR in. No connecting Anderson back to the locals.
GID00058515	It was either this or spend the rest of his life in an NCR chain gang.
GID00058516	Allowing Anderson to get away with murder tells him and everyone else that it's permissable.
GID00058517	What will you do if Caesar wins?
GID00058518	You can do better than that.
GID00058519	Arcade, I'm asking you because I'm interested. Don't put yourself down.
GID00058520	Why don't you like talking about yourself?
GID00058521	I'll say.
GID00058522	Let's talk about something else.
GID00058523	Goodbye.
GID00058524	Of course.
GID00058525	Why not to the whole area equally?
GID00058526	Noted.
GID00058527	Redundancy. If Caesar takes the dam and cuts off power, it will be chaos all over New Vegas.
GID00058528	You can always use more power, right?
GID00058529	Er...
GID00058530	Oh, uh... whoops, I thought that was to turn it off.
GID00058531	I'm thinking I'm going to get a sweet Pre-War laser. What are you thinking?
GID00058532	Time for the NCR to roast.
GID00058533	If you're so sure it's going to be a bloodbath, maybe you should stay in Freeside.
GID00058534	What happens in Freeside won't make any difference if the Legion takes the dam. Fight with them.
GID00058535	You were born at Navarro, but you are your own man. They have their fight, and you have yours.
GID00058536	Well you... you're different.
GID00058537	You aren't like the others, Arcade. You're still young. It's up to you to decide who you want to be.
GID00058538	That was just talk. It's not the same for you.
GID00058539	You're right. They'll need every ally they can get at the dam.
GID00058540	You're right. Freeside needs doctors. It needs you.
GID00058541	Who, Caesar?
GID00058542	He seemed pretty smart to me.
GID00058543	He's a madman. What did you expect?
GID00058544	I don't think either of us can fully understand what he and the tribes have gone through.
GID00058546	Goodbye.
GID00058547	< Keep holdout weapons > Sure, I agree to disarm.
GID00058548	<Give Kenny the key from Canyon Runner>
GID00058549	<Give Kenny the key from Canyon Runner>
GID00058550	<Give Sammy the key from Canyon Runner>
GID00058551	<Give Sammy the key from Canyon Runner>
GID00058552	Goodbye.
GID00058553	<Speech more money>
GID00058554	Hey, I'm doing all of the work here. 50/50 and I'm game.
GID00058555	Twenty-five percent?! Fifty-fifty, or I walk.
GID00058556	<Speech more money>
GID00058557	<Barter>
GID00058558	This kind of work costs time and money. 50/50 would cover my expenses.
GID00058559	Are you crazy?! I'll be walking all over the place looking for these people.
GID00058560	Now that you're free to leave you don't need your dog tag anymore do you?
GID00058561	Goodbye.
GID00058564	Seems like you pop up everywhere, Victor.
GID00058565	Speaker Start
GID00058566	The password is "And to dare to do it."
GID00058567	The password is "The better part of valor."
GID00058568	Kill Benny at the Tops.
GID00058569	Benny fled and got captured.
GID00058570	Destroy the Boomers' leaders, Loyal and Pearl.
GID00058571	Fail to revert the White Glove Society to cannibalism through non-violence.
GID00058572	Give me the Auto-Doc part and put Caesar in a coma.
GID00058573	Here you go.
GID00058574	Never mind. I'm staying a bit longer.
GID00058575	Here's the chip.
GID00058576	Never mind. I'm staying here.
GID00058577	Let's go back to Cottonwood Cove.
GID00058578	Goodbye.
GID00058579	The pay is good, and you can make your own hours.
GID00058580	Yes, I need more time to prepare.
GID00058581	Goodbye.
GID00058582	Here you go.
GID00058583	<Keep holdout weapons> Here you go.
GID00058584	Actually, never mind.
GID00058585	Yes. Return what you took from me.
GID00058586	Not yet.
GID00058587	I thought you were destroyed.
GID00058588	Who are you?
GID00058589	The penthouse.
GID00058590	The High-Roller Suite.
GID00058591	The Cocktail Lounge.
GID00058592	The casino floor.
GID00058593	The basement.
GID00058595	VMQ02 - Render Unto Caesar.
GID00058596	Complete Securitron Vault.
GID00058597	Kill Mr. House.
GID00058598	Never mind.
GID00058599	Ally the Boomers with the Legion.
GID00058600	Ally the White Glove Society with the Legion.
GID00058601	Destroy the Brotherhood of Steel.
GID00058602	Kill the leaders of the White Glove Society, Marjorie and Mortimer.
GID00058603	Goodbye.
GID00058604	Goodbye.
GID00058605	I have the terms of your surrender here for you.
GID00058606	Singing isn't necessary, but I do have a paper for you to sign.
GID00058607	<Attack> If you won't surrender, then you'll die.
GID00058608	The terms are fair, refusing them would not be in your best interest.
GID00058609	I'll keep that in mind.
GID00058610	Out of my way, Lucius.
GID00058611	No trick, and I'm only trying to help.
GID00058612	I've brought something to fix the Auto-Doc.
GID00058613	I have what's needed to do the surgery.
GID00058614	Got tools so I can fix his brain.
GID00058615	A man who can cure Caesar, Arcade Gannon, waits outside. He's all yours.
GID00058616	No, I haven't.
GID00058617	I'm still working on that, actually.
GID00058619	How can I help you with your plan?
GID00058620	Heck Gunderson is dead. You won't have to worry about him any more.
GID00058621	Do you know where she is?
GID00058622	Do you know who he was? Where he went?
GID00058623	I thought Mr. House already agreed to hand over New Vegas to the NCR.
GID00058624	You don't have to worry about House. I already killed him.
GID00058625	You don't have to worry about House. I disconnected him from his system.
GID00058626	I can handle the dogs. Where do I need to go?
GID00058627	All right, got it.
GID00058628	Lot of soldiers around - where's First Recon?
GID00058629	Got it.
GID00058630	Sounds like fun. I'll get on it.
GID00058631	What else can you tell me about Little Buster?
GID00058632	Anything else I should know?
GID00058633	Got it.
GID00058634	He's all yours.
GID00058635	On second thought, hold off.
GID00058643	Don't be too hard on him. It's part of who he is.
GID00058644	A man should know when to let go.
GID00058645	It was an important part of her life. Why shouldn't she enjoy it?
GID00058646	Some people can't stop reliving their glory days.
GID00058647	I'm sure your father would be proud of you.
GID00058648	Why worry about it? You don't have to be your father.
GID00058649	His work was what mattered to him.
GID00058650	It seems pointless to do all of that without a goal.
GID00058651	They're loyal to you, too.
GID00058652	That's their story Arcade, not yours.
GID00058653	You've certainly done your part.
GID00058654	Let's get going.
GID00058655	What is that machine in your tent?
GID00058656	What is that machine in your tent?
GID00058657	Are you all right?
GID00058658	Are you all right?
GID00058659	You were saying?
GID00058660	You were saying?
GID00058661	[Medicine responses]
GID00058662	Is this the first time you've experienced sudden onset headaches?
GID00058663	Does your head hurt?
GID00058664	[Medicine 40+]
GID00058665	Is this the first time you've experienced sudden onset headaches?
GID00058666	Does your head hurt?
GID00058667	Sorry, I'll let you sleep.
GID00058668	[Medicine responses]
GID00058669	You're limping when you walk. How long has that been going on?
GID00058670	You don't look so good.
GID00058671	What were you saying about the White Glove Society?
GID00058672	The last time we met, your head seemed ready to explode.
GID00058673	What about the White Glove Society?
GID00058674	Yes, you said I should forge an alliance between the White Gloves and your Legion.
GID00058675	[Medicine options!!!]
GID00058676	I'm concerned your headaches might be symptoms of a more serious condition.
GID00058677	Do you get headaches a lot?
GID00058678	Are you okay?
GID00058679	Hello! We were talking?
GID00058680	[Medicine options]
GID00058681	You just experienced an Absence Seizure. Was this the first time?
GID00058682	What were you daydreaming about?
GID00058683	You just blanked out for several seconds.
GID00058684	Where do I find the Brotherhood? How do I destroy them?
GID00058685	[Medicine option]
GID00058686	I'm concerned you may have a serious neurological condition.
GID00058687	I think we should talk about your health.
GID00058688	Seriously, let's talk about your health.
GID00058689	What about the Auto-Doc in your tent?
GID00058690	[Medicine Check]
GID00058691	I'm afraid your symptoms are consistent with a brain lesion, most likely a tumor.
GID00058692	I don't know. Sounds serious, though.
GID00058693	[Speech Check.]
GID00058694	Straight-forward case of intra-cranial blastoma fibrolosis, I wager.
GID00058695	Sounds like a moderately severe case of Skullatosis.
GID00058696	[Medicine Check 75+]
GID00058697	I can perform the surgery, but I'll need proper tools and supplies from a Doctor's Bag.
GID00058698	Even with proper Surgical Tools, an operation of this sort might be beyond me.
GID00058699	[Speech Check 65+]
GID00058700	It's a simple procedure... as brain surgeries go.
GID00058701	I'll need a vise... or a large nutcracker...
GID00058702	One of my companions, Arcade, has medical expertise. You could take him as a slave.
GID00058703	He's standing right outside your tent.
GID00058704	I'll bring him to you.
GID00058705	Where would I find a diagnostic scanning module?
GID00058706	I'll leave at once.
GID00058707	There may be another solution.
GID00058708	I'll see what I can find out.
GID00058709	What do you have for trade?
GID00058710	I was hoping to pass the time with a game or two.
GID00058711	Up for some more Caravan?
GID00058712	Anything you can tell me about the Outpost?
GID00058713	Any work around here?
GID00058714	Never mind, I'll be going now.
GID00058715	What?
GID00058716	Uh, citizen, I guess.
GID00058717	[NCR] NCR Soldier.
GID00058718	Courier.
GID00058719	[Confirmed Bachelor] You didn't tell me your name.
GID00058720	What do you mean?
GID00058721	Something wrong with asking your name?
GID00058722	Didn't realize NCR was so spineless.
GID00058723	Forget it, then, you're a waste of time.
GID00058724	So is that a "no," you don't want to be friends, or...
GID00058725	Scared of something?
GID00058726	I could use some help with my gear.
GID00058733	I'd like to see your wares.
GID00058734	Goodbye.
GID00058735	I just killed everyone the old-fashioned way.
GID00058736	I killed everyone in the camp.
GID00058737	I'll do as you ask.
GID00058738	What exactly happened here?
GID00058739	You captured everyone?
GID00058740	I've heard enough.
GID00058741	You slaughtered innocent civilians?
GID00058742	Sounds like they got what was coming to them.
GID00058743	I admire the purity of the Legion's justice.
GID00058744	How can I serve the Legion?
GID00058745	Your "civilization" sounds like a pack of snarling dogs.
GID00058746	Tell me about Caesar.
GID00058747	Who is this Legatus you mention?
GID00058766	Good thing there are still people like you around.
GID00058767	I'm sure he means well.
GID00058768	But in the end, doesn't it all just come down to numbers anyway?
GID00058769	I thought you were interested in preserving life.
GID00058770	The world needs Caesar more than it needs you.
GID00058771	Enjoying your stay?
GID00058772	With how messed up New Vegas is, do you really think Caesar has nothing to offer?
GID00058773	I'm just trying to be open-minded.
GID00058774	Yes, that's exactly what I'm suggesting.
GID00058775	NCR is broken beyond repair. Its time has come.
GID00058776	The Legion is better than the alternative.
GID00058777	Actually, yes, I would like to see New Vegas turned into a slavery hub.
GID00058778	More than collateral damage. A necessary sacrifice.
GID00058779	That's a good way to put it.
GID00058780	They hide behind NCR's protection and they deserve everything coming to them.
GID00058781	Sorry. I just lose my head sometimes.
GID00058782	Whatever.
GID00058783	If you have a problem with me, why don't you just leave right now?
GID00058784	Why?
GID00058785	Fine. Get lost.
GID00058786	It will be an honor to fight for the Legion.
GID00058787	I must prepare myself before I go.
GID00058788	What do you think of the lockdown?
GID00058789	Why do you dislike McNamara so much?
GID00058790	What would you do if you became Elder?
GID00058791	Tell me about the lockdown.
GID00058792	How do you get supplies?
GID00058793	Let's talk about something else.
GID00058794	What is with that crazy sandstorm on the surface?
GID00058795	Tell me about what happened at HELIOS.
GID00058796	Did you know Hardin is trying to find a way to become Elder?
GID00058797	The NCR is currently looking to destroy you.
GID00058798	The NCR is currently looking to destroy you.
GID00058802	Tell me about the battle at HELIOS.
GID00058803	Tell me about your last Elder.
GID00058804	Male, Good Karma.
GID00058805	Male, Neutral Karma.
GID00058806	Male, Evil Karma.
GID00058807	Female, Good Karma.
GID00058808	Female, Neutral Karma.
GID00058809	Female, Evil Karma.
GID00058810	Never mind.
GID00058811	What is this place?
GID00058812	What are those statues of?
GID00058813	Any work around here?
GID00058814	I'll be going now.
GID00058815	I want to join the Brotherhood.
GID00058816	Can I still join the Brotherhood?
GID00058817	Yes, what is the task?
GID00058818	That depends on the task.
GID00058819	On second thought, I'm not really interested in joining the Brotherhood at the moment.
GID00058820	I installed the device up at Black Mountain, as instructed.
GID00058821	I already know how to use power armor.
GID00058822	Please do.
GID00058823	Don't I just put it on?
GID00058825	Rockets and energy weapons? That's an odd combination.
GID00058826	How do you know so much about this, again?
GID00058827	What kind of prototype were they making?
GID00058828	So what happens now?
GID00058829	Is there anything else for me to do?
GID00058830	About my reward...
GID00058831	I want to join the Brotherhood.
GID00058832	I wanted to ask about joining the Brotherhood again.
GID00058833	Yes, what is the task?
GID00058834	Tell me what the task is before I agree to anything.
GID00058835	On second thought, I'm fine not joining the Brotherhood.
GID00058836	I've taken care of the Van Graffs.
GID00058837	I'm looking for an antique rangefinder somebody might've sold you.
GID00058840	Would you like to come with me? I could use someone skilled in medicine.
GID00058841	Sounds reasonable.
GID00058842	Hmm, on second thought...
GID00058843	What kinds of illnesses are you trying to deal with?
GID00058844	Let's talk about something else.
GID00058845	You're right. Let's talk about something else.
GID00058846	Good point. Goodbye.
GID00058847	Would you reconsider my offer to travel with me? I could really use your help.
GID00058848	They profit from crime, now I profit, too.
GID00058849	Goodbye.
GID00058850	I need you to leave.
GID00058851	What's your problem with ED-E?
GID00058852	Ooooo-kay.
GID00058853	What's an eee-em-pee?
GID00058854	That sounds a little paranoid, Arcade.
GID00058855	I'll keep an eye on it.
GID00058856	Do you always deflect personal questions?
GID00058857	How did you join the Followers?
GID00058858	Where did you get your medical training?
GID00058859	If you don't like it, leave.
GID00058860	Sure.
GID00058861	Not right now, Arcade.
GID00058862	What are you talking about?
GID00058863	Arcade, I'm not interested.
GID00058864	All right, let me hear it.
GID00058865	I'm sure. I'm not interested.
GID00058866	Where did the Enclave go?
GID00058867	What happened to Navarro?
GID00058868	Where are you going with all this?
GID00058869	Do you want them to help NCR?
GID00058870	Say no more. I'll do it.
GID00058871	I'm not interested.
GID00058872	Never mind. Let's talk about something else.
GID00058873	Actually, I already know how to use power armor.
GID00058874	I'd appreciate a lesson.
GID00058875	It's just like other armor, but heavy, right?
GID00058876	So no one knows you're here?
GID00058877	There's a Brotherhood of Steel base inside one of the bunkers here!
GID00058878	What are Powder Gangers?
GID00058879	You might want to know that I fixed your radio earlier.
GID00058880	I did what I could, but the capacitor needs to be replaced.
GID00058881	I found one of your patrols out in the waste. Your men are dead.
GID00058882	Actually, I'd rather just be going. If I could just have my belongings back...
GID00058883	No, what I told your man before was the truth. I don't like repeating myself.
GID00058884	It was a complete accident, I swear.
GID00058886	What's the New California Republic?
GID00058887	Can you tell me more about the NCR?
GID00058888	What's the Legion?
GID00058889	Why is the NCR interested in this desert?
GID00058890	I'm going after a man named Benny for revenge and I need someone to keep me patched up.
GID00058891	The NCR needs help against the Legion before Caesar moves on the dam. We could use your skills.
GID00058892	I'm trying to help Mr. House keep New Vegas independent.
GID00058893	If New Vegas can remain independent, I'm going to find a way to do it. I could use your help.
GID00058894	The NCR oppression around here would disappear if the Legion took control. I could use your help.
GID00058895	Things are bad around here. I'd like to make a difference, and I'd like you to help me.
GID00058896	This place is really complicated and stuff. You're smart. Can you help me do... things?
GID00058897	Yeah, I guess. So are you coming with me or what?
GID00058898	Ugh. Well if you're going to be like that then never mind.
GID00058899	Uh... it beats sitting around here all day, doesn't it?
GID00058900	Fair enough.
GID00058901	Oh, well... in that case, never mind.
GID00058902	Of course. I'm not interested in helping the Legion.
GID00058903	Well, uh... on second thought...
GID00058904	I need a good-looking doctor to help take care of me in the big, bad wasteland.
GID00058905	What kind of prototypes?
GID00058906	An odd combination.
GID00058907	What was Project SEMELE?
GID00058908	Do you need any help?
GID00058909	What kind of research do you do?
GID00058910	Goodbye.
GID00058911	Right. "The Followers don't endorse his actions," and all that.
GID00058912	If you say so. I'm not arguing.
GID00058913	Let's keep moving.
GID00058914	I'm sorry. I didn't realize it would end like this.
GID00058915	What's done is done.
GID00058916	Anderson killed White. He deserved to pay for what he did.
GID00058917	When was that?
GID00058918	What do you know about them?
GID00058919	The Elder has me looking for the lost patrols and retrieving their mission discs.
GID00058920	The Elder tasked me with contacting several scouts out in the waste.
GID00058921	The Elder has me looking for parts to fix the bunker's air filtration system.
GID00058922	I wanted to ask you some other questions.
GID00058923	I found the patrols for the Elder, and they had mission discs with orders from McNamara on them.
GID00058924	Do you know anything about the Chain That Binds?
GID00058925	One of the few times an Elder was dismissed was due to it.
GID00058926	Did you know there's a second part to it?
GID00058927	It says a superior is not allowed to give orders to the men under his subordinate.
GID00058928	The Elder wants me to retrieve components to help fix the air filtration system.
GID00058929	Er, what?
GID00058930	Maybe you misheard me.
GID00058931	Just give the details.
GID00058932	They're all right here.
GID00058933	Not all of them.
GID00058934	No, I haven't found any of them yet.
GID00058935	I wanted to ask you some questions.
GID00058936	Never mind. Let's talk about something else.
GID00058937	The Brotherhood of Steel has a base inside one of the bunkers here. They sent me after you.
GID00058938	How about this explosive collar around my neck?
GID00058940	I was just trying to fix it.
GID00058941	[Lie] I just fixed it.
GID00058942	[Lie] I just fixed it.
GID00058943	Nothing, I swear.
GID00058944	Actually, I rigged your radio with a bomb.
GID00058945	This seems like a bad location for a safehouse.
GID00058946	<Lie> Powder gangers use these bunkers as hideouts once or twice a month.
GID00058947	Well, criminals come through here. And the storms, they're bad. Right?
GID00058948	Not sure. Just feels bad.
GID00058949	You have to get out of here.
GID00058950	No, not really.
GID00058951	Hey, I fixed your radio.
GID00058952	How do I get access to more topics in the datastore?
GID00058953	I convinced him that staying here was more dangerous than moving on.
GID00058954	He was going to leave if he couldn't get his radio working. So I destroyed it.
GID00058955	Just tell me what you want me to do.
GID00058956	Go on.
GID00058957	One of the datastore entries mentioned the Chain That Binds. What is that, exactly?
GID00058960	What are they doing?
GID00058961	Let's talk about something else.
GID00058962	Goodbye.
GID00058968	Ted's been kidnapped. He's here in the hotel.
GID00058969	Ted's dead.
GID00058970	What about Primm Slim? Could he be sheriff?
GID00058971	Do you think Primm Slim could be sheriff?
GID00058972	Can I buy out the rest of his contract for 300 caps?
GID00058973	Apology accepted.
GID00058974	Happy you're sorry. What do I need to do next?
GID00058975	Let's move on, then.
GID00058976	You need me more than I need you - don't forget that.
GID00058979	I'm not actually armed.
GID00058980	Here you go.
GID00058982	Who is that?
GID00058983	Friend of yours?
GID00058984	Ooh, look. A body. I really should be going.
GID00058985	Go on.
GID00058986	You still haven't said where these guys were going.
GID00058989	You said before you had something taken from you.
GID00058990	I saw your old vault on the Strip. Vault 21, right? Mr. House filled it with concrete?
GID00058991	Is that when you settled out here with your wife?
GID00058992	Let's talk about something else.
GID00058993	Sounds good, kill her.
GID00058994	I'm not with her, so watch the spread.
GID00058995	You shoot, you'll regret it.
GID00058996	[Terrifying Presence] Raise that gun, and I'll kill everyone in here.
GID00058997	Cass is dead.
GID00058998	Cass? She's in the Mojave Outpost.
GID00058999	I doubt Cass will listen to anything I have to say.
GID00059000	Do you know where she is?
GID00059001	Is it because the Van Graffs attacked her caravan?
GID00059002	Why don't you do it?
GID00059003	Anything you can say to her, you can say to me.
GID00059004	What did you want to talk to her about?
GID00059005	If I run across her, I'll let her know.
GID00059006	These contract papers, for one.
GID00059007	Found out from investigating the wreckage.
GID00059008	Nowhere.
GID00059009	I'm not doing this for you.
GID00059010	Forget it, I'll bring her here.
GID00059011	Can you tell me anything more?
GID00059012	Give me a name, and I'll take care of it.
GID00059014	Earlier, it seemed like you knew Tabitha. What's the story there?
GID00059015	Can you tell me about the people who passed through town now?
GID00059016	I hear you may have information on some Khans that came through here with a guy in a checkered suit.
GID00059017	I hear you may have information on some Khans that came through here with a guy in a checkered suit.
GID00059018	Can you tell me about the man in the checkered suit who came through here?
GID00059019	Can you tell me where the man in the checkered suit went again?
GID00059020	<Speech Options>
GID00059021	You can tell me or you can rot in here.
GID00059022	I'll free you... right after you tell me...
GID00059066	What kind of research?
GID00059067	Why do you do research instead of providing medical assistance?
GID00059068	You don't sound too enthusiastic about it.
GID00059069	What's the goal?
GID00059070	What kinds of illnesses and injuries?
GID00059071	Isn't that the language that Caesar's Legion speaks?
GID00059072	Nihi-what?
GID00059073	Where did you learn that?
GID00059074	Do you know much about Caesar?
GID00059075	Why don't you come with me?
GID00059076	Do the Followers use a lot of energy weapons?
GID00059077	Memories of what?
GID00059078	If you say so.
GID00059079	I just want to hear Caesar out.
GID00059080	Let's just listen to him, figure out what he's up to, and get out.
GID00059081	Once we get close to Caesar, we can strike.
GID00059082	I'm not going to let Benny get away.
GID00059083	I'd like to rent a room.
GID00059084	Here's 100 caps.
GID00059085	I can't afford 100 caps right now.
GID00059086	Never mind.
GID00059087	I'm sure I can get help with supply shortages.
GID00059088	You would establish a foothold in the region and be one step closer to rebuilding the Mojave.
GID00059089	I'll keep that in mind.
GID00059090	What happens if I hang around one of your camps?
GID00059091	Goodbye.
GID00059093	Why did Mr. House want Kimball kept alive?
GID00059094	I'm on good terms with the NCR. They'll let me help protect him.
GID00059095	I might be able to convince the NCR to let me help out.
GID00059096	The NCR hates me. They won't let me within 1000 feet of Kimball.
GID00059097	I don't care what happens to Kimball.
GID00059098	Okay, I'll get it done.
GID00059099	What will the override module let you do?
GID00059100	I'll be on my way.
GID00059101	Er... join the White Glove Society. They're cannibals, but that's probably a step up for you.
GID00059102	Maybe my weak and flimsy hands can massage that out for you.<Apply Sleeper Hold>
GID00059103	Maybe beating your head on a rock will fix it.
GID00059104	Did you know there's a nerve on your neck that helps you sleep? It's... uh... I know it's here...
GID00059105	Look out, behind you! <Pistol Whip Carlyle>
GID00059106	Anything you can do to help me?
GID00059107	How do I get in?
GID00059108	How is your new cuisine faring?
GID00059109	What's next, now that the White Glove Society has tasted human flesh again?
GID00059110	Will you serve human flesh at the Gourmand?
GID00059118	I'll have to think on this more.
GID00059119	What would you like it for?
GID00059120	What are you going to do with it?
GID00059121	Ok, you can take it for a little while.
GID00059122	Why don't you want the Brotherhood to have it?
GID00059123	What is the final phase of the plan?
GID00059124	I have a few things to take care of before the battle at Hoover Dam.
GID00059125	All right, I'll go talk to the Followers.
GID00059126	I've already made arrangements with the Followers. I'm ready to fight at the dam.
GID00059127	Forget the Followers. I'm ready to fight at the dam.
GID00059128	I have some things to take care of before the battle at Hoover Dam.
GID00059129	What sort of options?
GID00059130	Just tell me what to do.
GID00059131	What are you talking about?
GID00059132	The dam is too valuable to destroy!
GID00059133	Fine, just tell me how.
GID00059134	You want me to destroy Hoover Dam?
GID00059135	What do I do?
GID00059138	<Upgrade Status::Verification>
GID00059139	What? Why?
GID00059140	Fine. Glad you could make me rich.
GID00059141	All right, I'm going.
GID00059142	Could I buy some spare munitions?
GID00059143	Goodbye.
GID00059144	Sure, here you go.
GID00059145	<Keep holdout weapons> Sure, here you go.
GID00059146	Why do you need my guns?
GID00059147	Could I trouble you to blow it out your ass?
GID00059148	[Attack] Looks like I'll have to kill you, then.
GID00059149	Where did you take my weapons?
GID00059150	I'd like to buy some food.
GID00059151	Goodbye.
GID00059152	Why don't you take your medicine?
GID00059153	It's too dangerous for you to miss doses. From now on I want you to take your medicine every time.
GID00059154	You should keep taking your meds every other time. It's worth the risk to remember your family.
GID00059155	That medicine isn't doing you any good. I want you to stop taking it altogether.
GID00059156	Never mind, we'll talk about it later.
GID00059157	I'm sure. I'd rather you didn't have any psychotic breaks, even if it means you aren't as strong.
GID00059158	On second thought....
GID00059159	That's good. Do that.
GID00059160	I'll risk you having more psychotic breaks if it means you're more dangerous in combat.
GID00059161	<Confirmed Bachelor>
GID00059162	A "personal matter," eh? Handsome guy like you, I bet there's a girl involved.
GID00059163	So tell me about this dame.
GID00059164	Can I get a code to use the VR pods in the mess hall?
GID00059165	Okay, I was just curious.
GID00059166	<Speech>
GID00059167	I'm genuinely interested in your people's history. What are the pods for?
GID00059168	I'm genuinely interested in your people's history. What are the pods for?
GID00059169	How exactly do you plan to get the plane back here?
GID00059170	Glad to have helped.
GID00059171	<Intelligence>
GID00059172	Are you planning to use diversionary tactics to draw their attention?
GID00059173	But won't that attract the attention of the NCR?
GID00059174	Okay, well I'm glad to have helped.
GID00059175	I have more to turn in.
GID00059176	Let's talk about something else.
GID00059177	I'm looking for a man in a checkered coat. Have you seen anyone like that?
GID00059178	What was that recording you were listening to?
GID00059179	Why is it hard to remember them?
GID00059181	And I suppose you'd nominate yourself?
GID00059182	I'll see what I can do.
GID00059183	What do I get out of helping you?
GID00059184	I'm Elder McNamara's representative. He said to ask if the bears are still hunting.
GID00059185	He said to tell you that the Chain That Binds bids you to speak.
GID00059186	I'm just wondering what you're doing here.
GID00059187	Sorry, didn't mean to disturb you. I'll just be going.
GID00059188	Elder McNamara sent me as his representative. He asks if the bears are still hunting.
GID00059189	What are you doing way up here?
GID00059190	Don't mind me. Just passing through.
GID00059191	Elder McNamara sent me for your report. He asks if the bears are still hunting.
GID00059192	What are you doing here?
GID00059193	Guess I'll be going then.
GID00059194	Why should I help you?
GID00059195	Surely you have people better suited to look for them than me.
GID00059196	I was hoping to speak to you about other matters.
GID00059197	No, I had some questions for you.
GID00059198	I wanted to ask you a few questions.
GID00059199	What's article 49?
GID00059200	What have I done?
GID00059201	Take 200 caps, and leave me be.
GID00059202	I don't have 200 caps.
GID00059203	[Attack] You've just screwed up, big time.
GID00059204	Take 200 caps, and leave me be.
GID00059205	[Attack] I'll give you something nice to talk about.
GID00059206	Fine, take 400.
GID00059207	[Attack] You just crossed the line.
GID00059208	[Attack] You just crossed the line.
GID00059215	What are you doing in Novac?
GID00059216	It's nice to see a friendly face out here.
GID00059217	You said the men that jumped me were heading this way, right?
GID00059218	Just stay out of my way, robot.
GID00059220	So what's the story with this place?
GID00059221	Quite a coincidence us meeting like this.
GID00059222	This is too big to be a coincidence, robot - what's your angle?
GID00059223	I could use a bed and some supplies
GID00059224	I could use another gun at my side.
GID00059225	How did you get here?
GID00059226	It's good to see you again, Victor.
GID00059227	Did you see Benny come this way?
GID00059228	Goodbye.
GID00059229	You see what happened in there?
GID00059230	I don't like being followed, robot.
GID00059231	Ahh! Where did you come from!
GID00059232	'Wind-Brahmin'? You mean the tumbleweeds?
GID00059233	The tumbleweeds?
GID00059234	What herd?
GID00059235	Oh, you're crazy, aren't you.
GID00059236	All I see are tumbleweeds.
GID00059237	Okay.
GID00059238	No.
GID00059239	How much?
GID00059240	All of my caps?
GID00059241	Okay.
GID00059242	I've also got something for you. Pass by my room later.
GID00059243	Let me ask you about something else.
GID00059244	The pleasure's for both of us. Pass by later, I'll let you in.
GID00059245	Thank you, I'm ready for it too.
GID00059249	Where do you usually go to drink?
GID00059250	Wait, you can make Moonshine?
GID00059251	Here's the items for making some Moonshine.
GID00059252	Can you make me some of your Moonshine?
GID00059253	Sure, go ahead.
GID00059254	No, I won't listen to you.
GID00059255	Why should I trust you?
GID00059256	What about Veronica? She seems to come and go as she pleases.
GID00059257	Have you tried bringing this up with the Elder yourself?
GID00059258	I'll see what I can do.
GID00059259	I refuse.
GID00059260	What can you tell me about the other members of the Brotherhood here?
GID00059261	What did I do to the NCR?
GID00059262	So what?! Screw you and screw the NCR!
GID00059263	What can I do about that?
GID00059264	Just leave me alone.
GID00059265	Please, just leave me alone
GID00059266	No, we finish this now.
GID00059267	Goodbye.
GID00059268	I'm ready. You'd better be, too.
GID00059269	What can you tell me about the Legion?
GID00059270	Why do you think the NCR and the Legion both want the Dam?
GID00059271	What do you know about the courier Benny shot?
GID00059272	I'm the courier Benny shot.
GID00059273	I'm serious.
GID00059274	You set me up. Now you die.
GID00059275	So I get to kill you over and over again. <Attack Yes Man.>
GID00059278	How do you propose to do that?
GID00059279	I want no part of this.
GID00059280	Explain to me again what you're trying to do.
GID00059281	Your terminal had some very interesting things to say about the state of the air filtration system.
GID00059282	So you and the McNamara both know about this?
GID00059283	The rest of the chapter should be told!
GID00059284	Don't worry, I'll keep your little secret.
GID00059285	Vote for Hardin when he calls a tribunal.
GID00059286	I changed my mind. I'll keep your little secret.
GID00059287	So you won't vote for Hardin?
GID00059288	What do you think of Hardin trying to get McNamara dismissed?
GID00059289	Now that the datastore is fixed, what do you think of Hardin trying to get McNamara dismissed?
GID00059290	Not right now. I want to ask you a few questions.
GID00059291	What kind of information is in the datastore?
GID00059292	About the virus...
GID00059293	No, it's nothing.
GID00059294	So you'd vote against McNamara if Hardin called a tribunal?
GID00059295	Show me what you have for sale.
GID00059296	I could look around for the pistol.
GID00059297	McNamara gave me permission to use the store, so start selling.
GID00059298	Anything I can help you with?
GID00059299	So you're a doctor?
GID00059300	What services can you perform?
GID00059301	You mentioned other duties you had?
GID00059302	Let's talk about something else.
GID00059303	Why not tell on him?
GID00059304	Was Initiate Watkins the "pet" you were referring to earlier?
GID00059305	You really don't like Taggart, do you?
GID00059306	What's with all the computers?
GID00059307	Shouldn't you be in school or something?
GID00059308	You said "anymore" before. Did the Brotherhood used to go out more?
GID00059309	Tell me about yourself.
GID00059310	Are you parents here somewhere?
GID00059311	So who do you take after more? Your mother or your father?
GID00059312	Initiate Stanton told me about your little adventure the other day.
GID00059313	What do you mean decide for yourself?
GID00059314	Let's talk about something else.
GID00059315	Tell me about the Knights.
GID00059316	Tell me about the Scribes.
GID00059317	I don't have ti-
GID00059318	I think I already found one of your patrols. Both Paladins were dead.
GID00059319	I already found a couple of your patrols. The paladins were all dead.
GID00059320	I already found all three patrols. They were all dead.
GID00059321	Not all of them.
GID00059322	I'll help you.
GID00059323	I have better things to do.
GID00059324	What happened with Elijah?
GID00059325	Tell me about what happened at HELIOS.
GID00059326	So you're head of security?
GID00059327	So why did I have to deal with that Ranger topside?
GID00059328	Did you know Watkins and Stanton snuck out of here a few weeks ago?
GID00059329	What exactly are the rules regarding entering and leaving?
GID00059330	I had other questions.
GID00059331	What would an Elder have to do to get kicked out?
GID00059332	Can you tell me about some of the other people here?
GID00059333	I've discovered proof that the chapter is in danger, and McNamara has covered it up.
GID00059334	Who is Elijah?
GID00059335	So you won't support Hardin if he calls a tribunal?
GID00059336	How do you know that?
GID00059337	He canceled?
GID00059338	What are you talking about?
GID00059339	Do you know who he was? Where he went?
GID00059342	I have a score to settle.
GID00059343	He has something of mine.
GID00059344	I'm looking for answers.
GID00059345	None of your business.
GID00059346	Whatever he's doing, I want in on it.
GID00059347	<Lie> He's a good friend of mine. I'm trying to help him out.
GID00059348	Forget it. I'll find him on my own.
GID00059349	What do you need?
GID00059350	You've had your needs neglected for far too long, haven't you? I can tell.
GID00059351	Any idea why they went that way?
GID00059352	Where is Boulder City?
GID00059353	That's all I needed to know.
GID00059354	Sure. Maybe I can help ease your mind.
GID00059355	I can't. I'm in a hurry.
GID00059356	Why don't you deal with it?
GID00059357	What needs to be done?
GID00059358	Okay, I'll see what can be done about it.
GID00059359	Actually, I already took care of it.
GID00059370	Who is Leo?
GID00059371	What kind of medicine are you taking?
GID00059372	Where'd you get that sword?
GID00059373	But... there's no one there.
GID00059374	So he's just a voice you hear in your head?
GID00059375	I'd like to know something else about you.
GID00059376	Now about the man I'm looking for...
GID00059377	What was I supposed to do again?
GID00059378	You don't need anything blown up?
GID00059379	Let's talk about something else.
GID00059380	I'll be back. I've got work to do.
GID00059382	What happened in that fight back there?
GID00059386	What did you want to teach me about?
GID00059387	[END TUTORIAL] I think I know what I need to know.
GID00059389	Where can I find more cards?
GID00059390	Good luck with that.
GID00059391	Goodbye.
GID00059392	Can you spare any medical supplies?
GID00059393	I'm looking for a man in a checkered coat.
GID00059394	What's Novac?
GID00059412	I don't have the caps.
GID00059414	Who's Jimmy?
GID00059415	I think you have me confused with someone else.
GID00059416	Never mind. Let's talk about something else.
GID00059418	I have some questions to ask you.
GID00059419	Lily, I'd like to talk to you about your medication.
GID00059420	Tell me about yourself.
GID00059421	What's the best way for me to use your skills?
GID00059422	Never mind, I had some other questions.
GID00059423	Where did you come from?
GID00059424	You were a soldier?
GID00059425	Who was the Master?
GID00059426	What happened then?
GID00059429	What is this place?
GID00059430	Here's your money.
GID00059431	All right, here's your money.
GID00059434	It's easy pickings. Why, you got somewhere else to be?
GID00059435	One of those men shot me. I need to know the best way to get to them.
GID00059436	Cowboy robot? You mean the one over there?
GID00059437	Cowboy robot? You mean Primm Slim?
GID00059438	Hey, just because you're idle and you'll never walk again... I forgot where I was going with that.
GID00059439	What did you do?
GID00059440	<Lie> I think the attackers were dead too... so it's... hard to tell.
GID00059442	Tell me about the Rangers.
GID00059444	But... the price tag seems so excessive on the souvenir rockets. Could you make it lower?
GID00059462	Jean-Baptiste in Freeside wanted to meet with you.
GID00059463	Know anything about Mr. House?
GID00059464	He's with the Van Graffs.
GID00059465	Let's do it, then.
GID00059466	See anything at the caravan site?
GID00059467	See anything at the second caravan site?
GID00059468	Any idea what was up at the site of the last caravan?
GID00059469	Interested in... uh... following me to Freeside?
GID00059470	How did they end up here?
GID00059471	Let's talk about something else.
GID00059472	I'm ready. Let's finish this.
GID00059473	I have some things to take care of before the battle.
GID00059474	I have some questions first.
GID00059475	Abraham wanted to say goodbye, and that he's gone North, into ghoul country.
GID00059476	Abe explained what happened in the Crater, how it healed him.
GID00059483	What did you expect a ghoul to say?
GID00059484	I found the ghoul with the Accelerator you were looking for.
GID00059486	I had to kill Monte for it.
GID00059488	Here's the accelerator.
GID00059489	You should watch this.
GID00059492	What did Abraham say to you?
GID00059494	I trapped Monte in a subway tunnel, that ghoul's not coming back.
GID00059496	I was the one who turned off the vents at Vault 34.
GID00059497	As I said, I saved you from being trapped down in Vault 34.
GID00059498	How's the "surface world" treating you?
GID00059499	Goodbye.
GID00059500	I don't need anything in return for my help.
GID00059501	I could use a Vault trinket.
GID00059502	How's the "surface world" treating you?
GID00059503	Goodbye.
GID00059504	How's the "surface world" treating you?
GID00059505	Goodbye.
GID00059506	How's the "surface world" treating you?
GID00059507	Goodbye.
GID00059508	Don't mention it, your freedom is enough reward for me.
GID00059509	How about a Vault trinket in exchange for my help?
GID00059510	Goodbye.
GID00059511	How's the "surface world" treating you?
GID00059512	I was the one who turned off the vents at Vault 34.
GID00059513	Goodbye.
GID00059514	I was the one who turned off the vents at Vault 34.
GID00059515	Goodbye.
GID00059516	<Lie> I'll need all the medical supplies you can spare for an injured man down by the highway.
GID00059517	Never mind.
GID00059518	< Medicine 25 >
GID00059519	Breathing is uneven, and he's coughing up blood. Possible internal injuries.
GID00059520	Well, there's lots of blood. And bruises. And maybe some other stuff, too.
GID00059521	< Barter 25 >
GID00059522	Give up some supplies now and you won't get your store looted later.
GID00059523	Maybe the Powder Gangers will reward you later.
GID00059524	< Speech 25 >
GID00059525	This is your chance to join the winning side. You have three seconds to decide. One...
GID00059526	It's better if you help me out, so just do it.
GID00059527	Never mind.
GID00059528	If you run the town, they'll have to work for you. Food, water, and money will be yours.
GID00059529	Free food, I guess.
GID00059530	Forget I said anything.
GID00059531	I already took care of Ringo.
GID00059532	Ringo's already settled. What's next?
GID00059533	Way ahead of you - I killed Ringo earlier.
GID00059534	I see.
GID00059535	I'm not an enemy, if that's what you're asking.
GID00059536	If you're going to shoot, you'd better not miss.
GID00059537	What does the NCR keep you safe from?
GID00059538	What do you know about the other group?
GID00059539	Where should I look for spare parts?
GID00059540	Funny you should mention that, I have array parts right here.
GID00059541	I passed through a place called Helios One. Maybe I could find parts there.
GID00059542	How long will I get this benefit?
GID00059543	For how long will I get this benefit?
GID00059544	Depends on the work.
GID00059545	What's the pay?
GID00059546	Never mind, I'll be going now.
GID00059547	Anything you can tell me about the Outpost?
GID00059548	What's the problem?
GID00059549	Legion turned that sinkhole into a graveyard.
GID00059550	[NCR] If I can help, I'm here to assist.
GID00059551	I'll do it.
GID00059552	Already been there, Nipton was attacked by the Legion.
GID00059553	Why don't you go check it out?
GID00059554	Hear any news from the West?
GID00059555	Not interested.
GID00059556	If I pass through there, I'll check it out.
GID00059557	Nipton was attacked by the Legion.
GID00059558	Legion turned that sinkhole into a graveyard.
GID00059559	Town's been attacked, not sure by who.
GID00059560	Did you have friends there?
GID00059561	Didn't mean to be the bearer of bad news.
GID00059562	If that's all you wanted, I'm done.
GID00059563	What was the job you mentioned before?
GID00059564	I did. Lorenzo's on it.
GID00059565	I'm still looking for them.
GID00059567	Yes, I did. Here are their reports.
GID00059568	No, not yet.
GID00059569	I appear to be lost. I'll just head back the way I came in.
GID00059570	I'm not going anywhere with you.
GID00059571	Lots of older people are still useful to their friends and communities.
GID00059572	Let's play.
GID00059573	I don't have time for a game right now.
GID00059585	Anything else?
GID00059587	If you were unconscious, how could you have done anything?
GID00059588	Your head was bonked. Couldn't have done anything.
GID00059589	Why do you think you let Betsy down?
GID00059590	Where'd you let Betsy down?
GID00059591	Thanks for the tip.
GID00059592	She... helped? You sure about that?
GID00059593	10 of Spades says his stuttering got better because of Usanagi.
GID00059594	Bitter-Root admitted that Usanagi was able to help him with his problems.
GID00059595	Sterling said that if he'd let his pride get in the way, he wouldn't be in First Recon.
GID00059596	Good to know.
GID00059597	You're right - we've never met.
GID00059600	Talking enemies down is an effective way to get what you want and save ammo.
GID00059601	I think I can teach you things about public speaking.
GID00059603	There are some key principles to stick to when it comes to bartering with traders.
GID00059604	I could teach you some tricks about trading.
GID00059606	I can teach how to make jacketed hollow points and other specialized ammo.
GID00059607	I bet I could teach you a thing or two about shooting.
GID00059609	I've done a lot of machining and lathe work over the years. I could write up a booklet for you.
GID00059610	Oh the stories I could tell you about fixing stuff with duct tape and bubble gum!
GID00059611	Let's talk about something else.
GID00059624	Who did you say I should talk to again?
GID00059625	Not yet, but I will soon.
GID00059626	Yes. Tell the troops to come protect Primm.
GID00059627	Let me think about it.
GID00059628	Thanks for patching me up, Doc.
GID00059629	You shouldn't have gone through my stuff.
GID00059630	What do I do now?
GID00059631	How'd you get started in the caravan business?
GID00059632	What the hell is a fish?
GID00059633	[Intelligence] I'm familiar. Do *you* know what a fish is?
GID00059634	So you just started in the caravan...?
GID00059635	So you traveled a lot.
GID00059636	What, like a courier?
GID00059637	How's caravan life in the Mojave?
GID00059638	[Cherchez La Femme] That's... rarely an issue.
GID00059639	[Black Widow] Soft men don't stay that way around me, I've found.
GID00059640	Not sure I understand your answer.
GID00059641	[Confirmed Bachelor] As long as we keep it on that level.
GID00059642	[Ladykiller] Miss Cassidy... are you flirting with me?
GID00059643	What can you tell me about New Vegas?
GID00059644	And caravan life's the same way?
GID00059645	Do you deal mostly with NCR?
GID00059646	Can you tell me anything about this Platinum Chip?
GID00059647	What about Caesar's Legion?
GID00059648	All right, just asking.
GID00059649	Do they deal with any caravans at all?
GID00059650	You sound frustrated.
GID00059651	NCR sounds like it has a lot to answer for.
GID00059652	There must be good parts to the Republic.
GID00059653	Any other differences between Legion and NCR?
GID00059654	What do you think of NCR?
GID00059655	There's a "but" in there.
GID00059656	You support it no matter what?
GID00059657	So they lack direction?
GID00059658	Yeah, I got that part, thanks.
GID00059659	Back to NCR.
GID00059660	So the Mojave suffers.
GID00059661	So what's the alternative?
GID00059662	There's other alternatives.
GID00059663	What do you mean?
GID00059664	Any thoughts on the Legion?
GID00059665	You sure you want to do this?
GID00059666	Got it. Let's loot the place.
GID00059667	Time to move on.
GID00059668	You all right?
GID00059669	So that's it, then.
GID00059670	You're welcome. Let's go.
GID00059671	Are you all right?
GID00059672	Better than the alternative.
GID00059673	Chasing the dead with more deaths isn't the way.
GID00059674	I'm for that, let's go kill them.
GID00059675	There's another way - we can get evidence, let NCR take them down.
GID00059676	The harm to the Van Graffs would last longer - and travel back West.
GID00059677	If I can get the evidence, will you consider it?
GID00059678	Here's the evidence of the deal. Without its twin, there's no proof.
GID00059679	Here's both pieces of evidence.
GID00059680	Not yet.
GID00059681	Because of what happened to your caravan.
GID00059682	No one enters into a deal like this unless they have dirt on their partner.
GID00059683	You know Gloria and Alice - what do you think?
GID00059684	Anyone you trust in NCR?
GID00059685	We have to try.
GID00059686	If he won't listen, then we can do things your way.
GID00059687	After all the shit I went through to get this, we're going to Jackson.
GID00059688	Where was your caravan hit?
GID00059689	How did you catch word of it?
GID00059690	Think there's anything left?
GID00059691	Site's probably nothing but bones and sand by now.
GID00059692	Already been there, nothing worth finding.
GID00059693	Let's go, then.
GID00059694	I may have already searched the area.
GID00059695	If there's time.
GID00059696	Why would they have done it during the day?
GID00059697	All right, let's check the place out.
GID00059698	Is there anything salvagable?
GID00059699	Want to go check it out?
GID00059700	Let's go.
GID00059701	If we have time, sure.
GID00059702	Let's leave it for now.
GID00059703	Want to check it out?
GID00059704	We'll make the time.
GID00059705	Got it, let's start looting.
GID00059706	Let's move.
GID00059707	Have you lived here a long time?
GID00059709	You sure seem like you have enough soldiers.
GID00059710	Is NCR sending more troops?
GID00059711	You sound frustrated.
GID00059712	I've heard enough.
GID00059713	I have evidence of a caravan conspiracy.
GID00059714	Can you get it to the right people?
GID00059715	You have our word.
GID00059716	Sure... no problem.
GID00059717	If you can promise it gets where it needs to go.
GID00059718	You're welcome.
GID00059719	It felt like the right thing to do.
GID00059720	Just get it to the NCR government.
GID00059721	You mentioned a reward before?
GID00059722	Could use a resupply.
GID00059723	[NCR] I'm here to assist.
GID00059724	I'll be going now.
GID00059725	Couldn't hurt.
GID00059726	[END TUTORIAL] No need. I think I've got it covered from here.
GID00059728	Well, you won't be getting any caps, but McLafferty won't be a problem for you.
GID00059729	Yes, here are their holotapes.
GID00059730	No, I've only found one of them so far. Both paladins were dead.
GID00059731	I've found two of the patrols. All of the paladins were dead.
GID00059732	No, I'm still working on it.
GID00059733	What do you mean, took me long enough?
GID00059734	Who are you?
GID00059735	Really?
GID00059736	Then why does your jumpsuit say "Miguel?"
GID00059737	Very funny.
GID00059738	So... that's a no, then?
GID00059739	Actually, hang out here for a while.
GID00059740	You're the mechanic around here?
GID00059741	Why does your jumpsuit say "Miguel?"
GID00059742	Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but I think she's dead.
GID00059743	<Black Widow>
GID00059744	A "personal matter," hmm? Handsome guy like you, I bet there's a girl involved.
GID00059745	I'd like to hear about that personal matter you mentioned.
GID00059746	<Speech>
GID00059747	Take a deep breath and focus, Lindsay. Where were you with him last?
GID00059748	Any idea where I should start looking, kid?
GID00059749	<Speech Options>
GID00059750	His sentence was almost up, and he isn't tied to the Powder Gangers.
GID00059751	Come on, he's just a convict. How bad could he be?
GID00059752	<Bribe>
GID00059753	Do you think I could "buy" a pardon for 200 caps?
GID00059754	Do you think I could "buy" a pardon for 200 caps?
GID00059755	Never mind, I'll be leaving now.
GID00059756	Goodbye.
GID00059757	Primm has seen better days.
GID00059758	Where should I go to get you a pardon?
GID00059759	I'll let you know when I do.
GID00059760	Not yet, but let me ask you about something else first.
GID00059764	I have some other questions.
GID00059765	That's it for now.
GID00059766	What do you need to take over protecting the town?
GID00059767	Let's talk about something else.
GID00059768	I'm still working on it.
GID00059769	I'll begin looking immediately.
GID00059770	I won't do it.
GID00059771	Wasn't Mexico City basically annihilated in the Great War?
GID00059772	Fixing things?
GID00059773	Why aren't you still there, then?
GID00059774	What happened with her?
GID00059775	But they didn't, did they?
GID00059776	Did you rescue her?
GID00059777	How did you survive?
GID00059778	What happened then?
GID00059779	Doubts? About what?
GID00059780	I think that's a great idea, Raul, and I hope you'll put them to good use with me.
GID00059781	If that's what you think is best, I won't stop you.
GID00059782	I don't think that's a good idea. You should focus on your mechanical skills instead.
GID00059783	That's not true, Raul, you're great with a pistol.
GID00059784	< Barter 20 >
GID00059785	That's it? Are you implying that I've done shoddy work?
GID00059786	That's all? I think you could afford to pay me a little more.
GID00059787	I don't care about your radio. Where did those guys go?
GID00059788	Jack is interested in a girl.
GID00059789	She works for the Crimson Caravan.
GID00059790	Just some kookie dame looking for love.
GID00059791	<Speech>
GID00059792	It would mean a lot to Jack if she could come to Nellis.
GID00059793	She's a great gal, you'll love her.
GID00059794	<Ladykiller>
GID00059795	Come on, Pearl, think of the joy it would bring Jack. He's in love.
GID00059796	<Reputation>
GID00059797	I assure you, Janet would not be a threat to the tribe.
GID00059798	She couldn't hurt a fly. Let her into Nellis.
GID00059799	Never mind. Let's talk about something else.
GID00059800	I'd like to talk about allowing Janet to visit Jack.
GID00059801	[PRESS DEMO] I'll look for your men and supplies. Send me to HELIOS One.
GID00059803	About your decision....
GID00059804	I think you're right. You should focus on gunslinging. You'll do the memories of your family proud.
GID00059805	You're right. You should give up the guns for good and focus on fixing things.
GID00059806	You're wrong. You should give up the gun and focus on repairing things.
GID00059807	You're wrong. You can still fight, and you should take up your guns again.
GID00059808	We'll talk later.
GID00059809	Sounds pretty bad.
GID00059810	Wasn't it dangerous to be dressed so... noticably?
GID00059811	Go on. What happened to Rafaela?
GID00059812	That's terrible, Raul.
GID00059813	So what did you do?
GID00059814	Never mind.
GID00059815	< Speech 20 >
GID00059816	I just need to know if I should watch my step around you.
GID00059817	I was just curious.
GID00059818	Never mind.
GID00059819	Goodbye.
GID00059820	Do you know where I can find the courier office?
GID00059821	I'd like to talk to you about Primm.
GID00059822	Hayes is undermanned and is requesting some additional support.
GID00059823	One of the convicts from NCRCF is looking for a pardon so he can protect Primm.
GID00059824	<Barter Options>
GID00059825	Having Primm - and the trade route - under NCR control would help the West.
GID00059826	If the NCR runs Primm... I bet you could sell it to... someone... somewhere.
GID00059827	Go back West, then, see if I care.
GID00059828	Good, go back to your famil... oh wait, they're fucking dead.
GID00059829	Life means we have to make tough choices - me included.
GID00059830	<Attack>That's it. Tired of listening to you anyway.
GID00059831	<Lie> Look... I'm trying to change, life's tough.
GID00059832	<Lie> The Mojave's a hard place. But I need to rise above that.
GID00059833	I'm... not proud of what I've done. I'm trying to change, really.
GID00059834	Tough words, but I needed to hear them. I'll change, I promise.
GID00059835	<Lie> I heard you, I did. I've changed... inside.
GID00059836	<Lie> I'll change Cass, I promise.
GID00059837	I'm trying to do better... really trying.
GID00059838	I've made mistakes. You judging me doesn't help.
GID00059839	Look, the Mojave's a tough place, all right?
GID00059840	Come on, I can change, really.
GID00059841	Can we talk about this?
GID00059842	I guess this is goodbye, then.
GID00059843	I wanted to ask you something else.
GID00059844	I had other questions.
GID00059845	I wanted to ask you some questions.
GID00059846	I've heard enough. Let's move on.
GID00059847	I changed my mind. This is something we should confront together.
GID00059848	Can you tell me about the Outpost?
GID00059849	Who are you?
GID00059850	Not exciting enough for you?
GID00059851	Looking for a man who shot me.
GID00059852	Don't really want to talk about it.
GID00059853	Twice. In the head.
GID00059854	A doctor helped patch me up.
GID00059855	He wanted something I was carrying.
GID00059856	I don't think it was personal.
GID00059857	Benny, wore a checkered suit.
GID00059858	Didn't introduce himself, wore a bad suit.
GID00059859	Well, in the meantime, he's given me a suite at the Lucky 38.
GID00059860	Does this mean you're not going to kill me?
GID00059863	You're welcome.
GID00059866	There's other places to go.
GID00059867	[NCR] I think they're both rangers, one desert, one NCR.
GID00059868	You any good in a fight?
GID00059869	Where did you learn to shoot?
GID00059870	You've used explosives?
GID00059871	And where did you learn how to handle dynamite?
GID00059872	Maybe it's not where you go, it's the company.
GID00059873	Running and gunning sounds interesting.
GID00059874	Why not? I could use someone who knows the roads.
GID00059875	If your world's a whiskey bottle, there's more out there.
GID00059876	That's... one way to put it.
GID00059877	Do you really want to stay in this shithole?
GID00059878	Stay here, you know exactly what's going to happen, day in, day out.
GID00059879	What's wrong?
GID00059880	All right. Come on, let's go.
GID00059881	Is whiskey your drink of choice?
GID00059882	Whiskey Rose?
GID00059883	I've met him. Nice impersonation.
GID00059884	Tell me about the pendant.
GID00059885	Pendant?
GID00059886	Are you all right?
GID00059887	Think we got off on the wrong foot. How about a drink?
GID00059888	What are you trying to forget?
GID00059889	Back West?
GID00059890	Uh, how about you keep your hands by your sides.
GID00059891	Why would they do that?
GID00059892	Doesn't sound like raiders.
GID00059893	Might have been Fiends, they're crazy like that.
GID00059894	Who's Jackson?
GID00059895	What are you going to do?
GID00059896	So you're out of the caravan business?
GID00059897	I'd slow down on that whiskey, if I were you.
GID00059898	That drinking's going to get you in trouble in a second.
GID00059899	Already cleared the roads for Jackson.
GID00059900	Anything you can tell me about the Outpost?
GID00059901	That fucking monument outside?
GID00059902	Covered in blood?
GID00059903	What are those statues supposed to be?
GID00059904	What did you mean about "covered in blood" before?
GID00059905	Why are you here at the bar?
GID00059906	Any work around here?
GID00059907	Any other work?
GID00059908	Sniper on the roof?
GID00059909	Any other work?
GID00059910	Don't waste my time with your reminiscing, Raul.
GID00059911	Loyal's using his years of knowledge to help his tribe. I think that's a noble goal.
GID00059912	What's on your mind?
GID00059913	At least he knew when to step back and start to take it easy. A lot of people don't.
GID00059914	Is that something you're afraid of?
GID00059915	I suppose if you're happy with that kind of life, it's not so bad.
GID00059916	Are you talking about something from your own past?
GID00059917	I don't really have time for this, Raul. Maybe later?
GID00059918	Go on.
GID00059919	What happened then?
GID00059920	What happened then?
GID00059921	And you blame yourself for this?
GID00059922	You can't think it was your fault. No one could stand against a dozen armed men all alone.
GID00059923	Anyone stupid enough not to set a watch deserved what they got.
GID00059925	I hate to tell you, but Tabitha's dead.
GID00059926	Um, I should probably go.
GID00059928	I had some other questions.
GID00059929	Never mind. Let's move on.
GID00059930	Any other weapons you know how to use?
GID00059931	Your mother was a tribal?
GID00059932	Tell me about your Dad.
GID00059933	Any idea why he went East?
GID00059934	Where'd you get that pendant?
GID00059935	Tell me about your Dad.
GID00059936	Just needed a little pick-me-up.
GID00059937	What's the problem?
GID00059938	Calm down. I had some questions.
GID00059939	Fine - wasn't planning to share anyway.
GID00059940	You could come with me.
GID00059941	Sure, what's on your mind?
GID00059942	Not now, Raul.
GID00059943	I don't have time for your useless chatter.
GID00059944	I think it's good that he's so devoted to his duty. More people should act that way.
GID00059945	The NCR put a lot of time and money into his training. He owes it to them to use it however he can.
GID00059946	With those injuries, he's nothing but a drain on resources. He should retire.
GID00059947	It might seem harsh, but a soldier can't do his job properly with those limitations.
GID00059948	You're talking about the Great War? What do you remember about it?
GID00059949	Why do I get the impression this is more personal to you?
GID00059950	It sounds like maybe you're talking about yourself there, Raul.
GID00059951	Why do you care so much, anyways?
GID00059952	We're not just talking about Ranger Andy, are we?
GID00059953	Is that what you did?
GID00059954	What is it about Ranger Andy that reminds you of yourself?
GID00059955	What are you talking about?
GID00059956	Can we discuss this another time?
GID00059957	Let's talk about something else.
GID00059958	That's a bit cryptic, Beatrix.
GID00059959	Sounds like you're a bit of a dom, Beatrix.
GID00059960	The children here don't seem interested in guns.
GID00059961	I think I could improve your curriculum.
GID00059962	Good to hear. The wasteland is no place for children.
GID00059963	What happens when they come of age?
GID00059964	Goodbye.
GID00059965	I can spare 2.
GID00059966	I can spare 4.
GID00059967	Actually. I can't spare anything right now.
GID00059968	I can spare 2 more.
GID00059969	I can spare 3 more.
GID00059970	Just take all of it.
GID00059971	Okay, I'll let you know if I find a pressure cooker.
GID00059972	Haven't been to Nipton yet.
GID00059973	Not yet.
GID00059974	What's with the soldiers?
GID00059975	Be my guest.
GID00059977	Crimson Caravan sent me, they want to buy out your caravan.
GID00059978	Wait, what happened to your caravan?
GID00059979	Why not?
GID00059980	You haven't even seen the offer yet.
GID00059981	So even if you have nothing, you won't sell?
GID00059982	I have the offer letter here, the terms are fair.
GID00059983	It's just a name, this - this is money.
GID00059984	I'm prepared to offer you the terms, plus 750 caps.
GID00059985	Maybe... there's something else we could trade?
GID00059986	I'm not going to offer money, I wanted to drink for it.
GID00059987	That amount's enough to start a new caravan... with the old name.
GID00059988	I think you're a realist, and know a good offer when you see one.
GID00059989	Far from it, to turn down the original terms.
GID00059990	The Crimson Caravan will most likely change the name once they buy it.
GID00059991	Wouldn't suggest otherwise.
GID00059992	After Cassidy Caravans gets renamed, just start it up again.
GID00059993	Which means they're paying you to rebuild Cassidy Caravans, not sell it.
GID00059994	Just insuring future work with the Crimson Caravan.
GID00059995	Let's just say I prefer when both sides are happy.
GID00059996	Whatever gets the job done. Sign here.
GID00059997	So what... you're just going to keep it?
GID00059998	If you made the caravan, you're responsible for killing it.
GID00059999	Uh... as long as we don't share the same bottle.
GID00060000	We haven't finished all the bottles yet.
GID00060001	I feel great, actually. Another?
GID00060002	Still feel a little parched.
GID00060003	I flll fnnne.
GID00060004	Hmm? MmmMmmm.
GID00060005	Yeah... well, feel a... a little dizzy.
GID00060006	I think... think my liver's trying to crawl out my ass.
GID00060007	I totally love you and your little hat.
GID00060008	When I mmmet you I thought you were thbiggst bitch.
GID00060010	Looking to join up with me again?
GID00060011	Just passing through.
GID00060012	Had some questions I wanted to ask you.
GID00060013	Surprised you can see me from that deep in the bottle.
GID00060014	Was looking for someone worth my time, I was mistaken.
GID00060015	How about a drink instead?
GID00060016	Not yet.
GID00060018	I've changed my mind. I'm not going to do it.
GID00060019	I thought you said I didn't have to kill her.
GID00060020	Forget it, then. I had something else I wanted to ask.
GID00060021	Never mind. I'll be going.
GID00060022	Are you sure?
GID00060023	If you think staying here's any better...
GID00060024	This Outpost is the last place you want to be trapped.
GID00060025	I wanted to talk to you more about buying your caravan.
GID00060026	Who believes in holding on to a dead caravan?
GID00060027	I may be honest, but at least I'm not blinded by pride.
GID00060028	Helped out Jackson and cleared the road North.
GID00060029	What will you do now?
GID00060030	I had something else I wanted to ask.
GID00060031	I'll be going now.
GID00060032	What will you do now?
GID00060033	I'll get a dozen bottles of whiskey and be back.
GID00060034	Here's a dozen bottles, let's go.
GID00060035	Got the whiskey, let's do this.
GID00060038	Could you help me craft something?
GID00060043	Could you could teach me to punch better?
GID00060047	Sure, teach me.
GID00060048	Not right now.
GID00060049	Anything else?
GID00060050	Is there someplace you wanted me to take you?
GID00060051	Okay.
GID00060052	I changed my mind. I'm not going inside, either.
GID00060053	They were distributing supplies down by the old train station, but I dealt with them.
GID00060054	Nevermind.
GID00060056	What are you doing in here?
GID00060058	Goodbye.
GID00060059	I already know how to wear Power Armor.
GID00060060	I'll talk to her, then.
GID00060062	Are you well respected among other members of the Brotherhood?
GID00060063	Why is the Brotherhood interested in Nevada?
GID00060064	Ever been in love?
GID00060065	What happened?
GID00060066	You didn't go with her?
GID00060067	I want to discuss other things.
GID00060068	With Tabitha gone, what will happen to this place?
GID00060069	I'll leave things here to you, then.
GID00060070	You're not hiding something from me, are you?
GID00060071	Didn't your friend just say so?
GID00060072	Sorry, didn't mean to intrude.
GID00060073	Your friend looks like he's in bad shape.
GID00060074	You already let me in the other night! Do all of us civilians look the same to you soldier boys?
GID00060075	I'm here to see Major Kieran on urgent business. Please let me pass.
GID00060076	Come on, guys, you can let me in, right? Right?
GID00060077	I hate to tell you this, but Rex is dead.
GID00060078	Rex died in battle, saving my life.
GID00060079	You know, I really don't pay attention to him, so your guess is as good as mine.
GID00060080	He sure did.
GID00060081	I don't have to give him back just yet, do I?
GID00060082	Should I leave you two alone?
GID00060083	I wanted to speak to you about the Great Khans.
GID00060086	I'd like to purchase some supplies.
GID00060087	Tell me about yourself.
GID00060088	I have some questions about the NCR.
GID00060089	<Reputation Check>
GID00060090	Not even to a friend of the NCR?
GID00060091	Come on! Don't you want to make a few caps?
GID00060092	<Speech Check>
GID00060093	I completely understand, but I am working for the good of the NCR too.
GID00060094	Come on! Who's going to know?
GID00060095	Let's go back to my other questions.
GID00060096	How do you feel about the NCR being out here?
GID00060097	What are your thoughts about the Legion?
GID00060098	What do you know about the dam?
GID00060099	I'm sorry for what I'm about to do to you. Well, not really.
GID00060116	What's the problem with your mission?
GID00060117	Tell me about the correctional facility.
GID00060118	Do you have any information on the convicts?
GID00060119	All right.
GID00060120	It's about time. Hand them over.
GID00060121	What was strange about it?
GID00060122	Some men stole my package. A man in a checkered suit and some thugs. Did they pass this way?
GID00060123	Who are you?
GID00060124	Where are you from?
GID00060125	How old are you?
GID00060126	What's "Petro-Chico?"
GID00060127	Where'd you get that Vaquero outfit?
GID00060128	How'd you end up at Black Mountain?
GID00060129	Then why does your jumpsuit say "Miguel?"
GID00060130	Anything else you want to share?
GID00060131	But how did Tabitha find you in the first place?
GID00060132	How can I make the best use of your skills?
GID00060133	I don't believe that, you must have some skills.
GID00060134	What use are you to me, then?
GID00060135	Can you still repair my equipment?
GID00060136	I want to ask you something else about yourself.
GID00060137	Tell me about Hidalgo Ranch and the Great War.
GID00060138	Tell me about your time in Mexico City.
GID00060139	Tell me about the girl in Tuscon.
GID00060171	Actually, I won't be needing your services any longer.
GID00060172	Will do.
GID00060173	It is, but I think I'll explore it on my own from now on.
GID00060174	That's one word for it. Let's keep going.
GID00060175	I don't need your services any longer.
GID00060176	None taken. Let's go.
GID00060177	Sure, let's go.
GID00060178	I don't have that many caps.
GID00060179	Why would I want you to tag along with me?
GID00060180	That's okay. I don't really need the company.
GID00060181	You can stop following me around now.
GID00060182	What can you tell me about the Kings?
GID00060183	Nah, let's go.
GID00060184	Sounds good to me.
GID00060185	I don't have that kind of money.
GID00060186	Why would I need a bodyguard here?
GID00060187	I don't think I need a guard.
GID00060188	I don't think I need a bodyguard. You can go.
GID00060189	No, it's nothing. Let's continue.
GID00060190	What can you tell me about the Kings?
GID00060191	I don't have that kind of money.
GID00060192	<100 caps> Fix me up.
GID00060193	<100 caps needed> I don't have the caps.
GID00060194	Never mind.
GID00060195	<75 caps> Fix me up.
GID00060196	<75 caps needed>
GID00060197	<50 caps> Fix me up.
GID00060198	<50 caps needed>I don't have the caps.
GID00060199	Yes.
GID00060200	No.
GID00060201	<Lie> Sure am. I just recently arrived here from California.
GID00060202	<Lie> Yup, sure am. From NCR, I mean.
GID00060203	I don't have time for this.
GID00060204	Sure.
GID00060205	I think I'll pass.
GID00060206	Kimball.
GID00060207	Tibbett.
GID00060208	Tandi.
GID00060209	Peterson.
GID00060210	Okay, you got me. I'm not an NCR citizen.
GID00060211	The Boneyard.
GID00060212	Shady Sands.
GID00060213	Aradesh.
GID00060214	Vault 13.
GID00060215	A two-headed bear.
GID00060216	An eagle.
GID00060217	A two-headed snake.
GID00060218	A two-tailed lion.
GID00060219	Can I take the test again?
GID00060220	Does every NCR citizen really know this stuff?
GID00060221	Yes.
GID00060222	No, I'll come back later.
GID00060223	Guess I'll just go, then.
GID00060224	I sure am.
GID00060225	No, I'm not.
GID00060226	Lay it on me.
GID00060227	I don't really have time for this.
GID00060228	Kimball.
GID00060229	Tibbett.
GID00060230	Tandi.
GID00060231	Peterson.
GID00060232	The Boneyard.
GID00060233	Shady Sands.
GID00060234	Aradesh.
GID00060235	Vault 13.
GID00060236	A two-headed bear.
GID00060237	An eagle.
GID00060238	A two-headed snake.
GID00060239	A two-tailed lion.
GID00060240	Can't I try again?
GID00060241	I'm ready.
GID00060242	No, I'll come back later.
GID00060243	Oh come on. I'm betting not everyone in the NCR knows these things.
GID00060244	I've got 100 caps here that all say I'm a loyal NCR citizen.
GID00060245	Would, say, 10 caps maybe change your mind?
GID00060246	Screw this, I'm leaving.
GID00060247	I really don't have time for this.
GID00060248	You don't know me? Your boss does - we're very good friends. You should leave.
GID00060249	What do you mean?
GID00060250	Sounds like cheating.
GID00060251	Sounds like fun.
GID00060254	Sure, what's on your mind?
GID00060255	I'd really rather you didn't.
GID00060256	Maybe later, okay?
GID00060257	What do you mean, guys like Ranger Andy?
GID00060258	I think he's a hero of the NCR.
GID00060259	He's a pathetic waste of space.
GID00060260	He seems like a decent guy.
GID00060261	Even after a crippling injury, a guy like Andy's tougher and more dangerous than most men alive.
GID00060262	I think it's good that he's retired. Out of sight, out of mind.
GID00060263	Guys like us?
GID00060264	Just because someone's crippled doesn't mean they're useless. All that experience is invaluable.
GID00060265	He didn't have to give it up, he's just scared he doesn't have what it takes anymore.
GID00060266	Are you talking about Andy, or yourself?
GID00060267	Oh, right. You've got a thing about people with hats.
GID00060268	You're certainly looking better.
GID00060269	Glad to hear it.
GID00060270	So you're better? Good - I won't have to strip you for parts.
GID00060271	Goodbye.
GID00060272	We're on the same side. Settle down!
GID00060273	Cut that out or I'll turn you into a hat.
GID00060274	What's that, boy? Little Jimmy fell into a well?
GID00060275	What's that, Rex? Little Jimmy fell down the well?
GID00060276	Huh?
GID00060277	It's times like this that I wish you could talk.
GID00060278	Let's go check out that well, boy.
GID00060279	We have better things to do right now.
GID00060280	Did someone fall into a well?
GID00060281	Are you saying I should stab the next person I see?
GID00060282	Is there a radioactive twister coming?
GID00060283	Do you smell an ambush?
GID00060284	Is it going to rain?
GID00060285	I want to take a closer look at you.
GID00060286	[Examine the painting of the bull on Rex's side.]
GID00060287	[Stop examining Rex.]
GID00060288	[Examine Rex's brain case.]
GID00060289	[Examine Rex's mechanical parts.]
GID00060290	Where is he now?
GID00060291	Were you close?
GID00060292	What did you learn from him?
GID00060293	Let's talk about something else.
GID00060294	How is that different? What did you learn from him?
GID00060295	What was in the note?
GID00060296	Did you follow him from California?
GID00060297	What changed?
GID00060298	Ever try to talk sense into him?
GID00060299	How is that different from how any other Elder would've reacted?
GID00060300	Can you help me find the package I lost?
GID00060301	Sounds good to me. Does that mean you're in?
GID00060302	That's way better than what I had in mind.
GID00060303	I think you'll be a very good distraction.
GID00060304	I haven't decided.
GID00060305	Do you have a preference?
GID00060306	Does it matter who we help?
GID00060307	So you're not coming?
GID00060308	I want to help the Legion defeat the NCR.
GID00060309	<Lie> That's what I was thinking, too.
GID00060310	Are you coming to this thing or what?
GID00060311	<Lie> Then you'll be happy to know I'm planning on helping the Legion.
GID00060312	No. I was planning on helping the Legion against the NCR.
GID00060313	<Lie> I was hoping you'd want take down the NCR, since that's the plan.
GID00060314	How do you know about Benny?
GID00060315	How come your last name isn't Van Graff?
GID00060318	I have some questions I'd like to ask you.
GID00060320	Tell me about yourself.
GID00060321	Will you tell me some of your stories again?
GID00060325	Can you tell me anything about Mr. House?
GID00060326	I'm looking for the man who shot me: he wears a checkered coat and carries a shiny pistol. Seen him?
GID00060327	Do you know anything about a goon named Benny? Wears a checkered coat, carries a big pistol?
GID00060328	What's your take on the NCR?
GID00060329	How do you feel about Caesar's Legion?
GID00060330	Tell me about New Vegas.
GID00060331	I had some other questions.
GID00060332	Let's talk about something else.
GID00060333	That's all I wanted to know. We'll talk more later.
GID00060334	You're being sarcastic, aren't you?
GID00060335	Really? That's great! Any idea where he might come from?
GID00060336	You can't seriously think they're the same Mr. House.
GID00060337	Maybe there's a connection. Can you remember anything else about Robert House?
GID00060338	That's sickening.
GID00060339	Enough about Johnson. What's next?
GID00060340	What will your friends think about this?
GID00060343	Why wasn't the data we collected useful?
GID00060344	Tell me again about Benny's Securitron.
GID00060345	Don't be so hard on yourself. Life would be dull if it weren't for all the little mistakes.
GID00060346	Alcohol is the only way Benny could ever get any action from a smart girl like you.
GID00060347	Getting sucker punched by Benny happens to the best of us.
GID00060348	Maybe you should chalk it up to being irresponsible and naive.
GID00060349	What kind of trouble?
GID00060350	We don't need him. If he wants to go, let him go.
GID00060351	I'll talk to Moreno.
GID00060353	I'm sorry I had to kill him - he didn't give me much choice.
GID00060354	Doesn't matter - he paid for his mistake.
GID00060355	Whatever.
GID00060356	We don't have to fight. We can still talk about this.
GID00060357	Come and get me.
GID00060358	Which way to Primm?
GID00060359	Who are you?
GID00060360	Goodbye.
GID00060361	Let's trade.
GID00060362	Do you have anything to trade?
GID00060363	Goodbye.
GID00060364	Goodbye.
GID00060365	Goodbye.
GID00060366	What if I go around the caravan?
GID00060367	Goodbye.
GID00060368	Radiation supplies.
GID00060369	I've changed my mind.
GID00060370	Who are the Followers of the Apocalypse?
GID00060371	What are your goals?
GID00060372	Who was this Father Elijah to you?
GID00060373	Do you have any other family in the Brotherhood?
GID00060374	A dress?
GID00060375	Tell me something else about you.
GID00060376	That's your goal? You want a nice dress?
GID00060377	I'm looking for Ambassador Crocker.
GID00060378	What is this place?
GID00060379	What's happening on the Strip?
GID00060380	Tell me about the Casinos on the Strip.
GID00060381	What else is there to do besides the Casinos?
GID00060382	Yes it is.
GID00060383	No, I've been here before.
GID00060384	None of your business.
GID00060385	Tell me about the Lucky 38.
GID00060386	What's the deal with the Ultra-Luxe?
GID00060387	What do you know about Gomorrah?
GID00060388	What's The Tops like?
GID00060389	I want to ask about something else.
GID00060390	What the hell are you?
GID00060391	Can we get down to business?
GID00060392	Stealth Boy.
GID00060393	Cat Eye.
GID00060394	Magazines.
GID00060395	I've changed my mind.
GID00060396	Regular Gun Ammo.
GID00060397	Energy Weapon Ammo.
GID00060407	I found some of your people dead out in the waste. They had it on them.
GID00060408	Why do you look so spooked?
GID00060409	Who are you?
GID00060410	Could you just let me go? I really don't care what's down here anymore.
GID00060411	Why are you here?
GID00060412	Why are you here?
GID00060413	Regular stims.
GID00060414	Super stims.
GID00060415	Actually, nevermind.
GID00060416	Why are you here?
GID00060417	Why are you here?
GID00060426	Maybe you should've stayed at Hidden Valley.
GID00060427	You don't control the people who did this.
GID00060428	These people are dead because you were careless and selfish.
GID00060429	You can just join the Followers somewhere else.
GID00060430	I have to go.
GID00060431	I should be going.
GID00060432	The Great Khans' second-in-command seems amenable to allying with the NCR.
GID00060433	Papa Khan has named me his successor. We might be able to arrange an alliance with NCR.
GID00060434	Papa Khan has named me his successor. We might be able to arrange an alliance with NCR.
GID00060436	Ethel's right. Vengeance will only lead to more innocents' deaths.
GID00060437	Ethel's right. Vengeance will only lead to more innocents' deaths.
GID00060438	The current leader of the tribe is dead-set against it. Maybe a diplomatic solution would work.
GID00060439	Okay, I'll do it. What's the plan?
GID00060440	I'm not interested in a career in political killings.
GID00060442	I need healing.
GID00060443	Can I join the Followers?
GID00060444	What do you do here?
GID00060445	Is Dr. Schiller here yet?
GID00060446	It was all her idea.
GID00060447	She hasn't shared any secrets. You don't have any proof otherwise.
GID00060448	<Burp Loudly>
GID00060449	Your face must be pretty ugly to always be wearing that helmet. Do you wear it on dates, too?
GID00060450	I have some questions about Primm.
GID00060451	I have some more questions about Primm.
GID00060452	I'd like to ask you about something else.
GID00060453	Goodbye.
GID00060454	You'll be the element of surprise.
GID00060455	It was Arcade's suggestion, not mine.
GID00060456	You tell me.
GID00060457	How are you going to deploy your squad?
GID00060458	What is this place?
GID00060459	Goodbye.
GID00060460	I want you to help the NCR hold onto the Dam.
GID00060461	Help the Legion take over the Dam.
GID00060462	You're the officer here. Can't you just order him to go along with the plan?
GID00060463	Will Moreno be a liability?
GID00060464	What's Moreno's problem with the NCR?
GID00060465	Can't you just order Johnson to go along with the plan?
GID00060466	Will Johnson be a liability?
GID00060467	Any chance of talking Johnson into staying?
GID00060468	< Speech 80 >
GID00060469	The Remnants come in, guns blazing, showing the NCR how it's done. You actually don't want that?
GID00060470	This is a chance for one more moment of glory.
GID00060471	I work against the NCR as much as I work for them. This is no different.
GID00060472	Goodbye.
GID00060473	What are you doing?
GID00060474	Will caps change your mind?
GID00060475	Can you tell me anything about Anderson?
GID00060476	Will do.
GID00060477	Hey, I risked a lot to get you that data feed.
GID00060478	What's the big deal?
GID00060479	Let's talk about something else.
GID00060480	Goodbye.
GID00060481	Did Benny say why he had the Securitron?
GID00060482	What did he have you do?
GID00060483	Did something... happen between you two?
GID00060484	You didn't think to tell anyone about this?
GID00060486	Hmm. I'll be right back.
GID00060487	Is there a health inspector bothering you?
GID00060488	I'm not the gambling type. I need to keep moving.
GID00060489	Goodbye.
GID00060490	This is Veronica, formerly of the Brotherhood of Steel. She's interested in joining your cause.
GID00060492	Fine, I'll find the gun for you.
GID00060493	Why do the records show that the gun was turned back in?
GID00060494	Sorry, I can't help you.
GID00060495	I'm trying to help Torres find a missing laser pistol. Have you seen it around?
GID00060496	I have to be going.
GID00060497	I'll try my best to find it.
GID00060498	Could you be a little more specific about where you dropped it?
GID00060499	I better go and start looking.
GID00060500	Can I just get you another laser pistol?
GID00060501	Ok, you can have ED-E for a little bit.
GID00060502	Your plan is crazy.
GID00060503	Something wrong?
GID00060504	Why's that?
GID00060505	Why's that?
GID00060506	Why no more patrols?
GID00060507	Why aren't there any patrols anymore?
GID00060508	That's terrible.
GID00060509	That's horrible.
GID00060510	A virus?
GID00060511	Anything I can do?
GID00060512	Anything I can do to help?
GID00060513	What do I do?
GID00060514	What do I need to do?
GID00060515	Why the lockdown?
GID00060516	Why the lockdown?
GID00060517	I have to be going.
GID00060518	I've had better.
GID00060519	Need any help?
GID00060520	Sorry to hear that. I should be going.
GID00060521	That's too bad. I really have to go.
GID00060522	Let's go back to that virus you mentioned.
GID00060523	I'll give it a try, then.
GID00060524	Sounds complicated. I'll leave you to it.
GID00060525	Can the virus's files be partitioned so read-access is only provided by the kernel administrator?
GID00060526	You could just delete all the files. That would get rid of the virus, right?
GID00060527	Maybe I'll try another time.
GID00060528	Goodbye.
GID00060529	Goodbye.
GID00060530	Your advanced level of tech would be useful in settling things between the NCR and the Legion.
GID00060531	There isn't anyone else around with your equipment and expertise.
GID00060532	I never said anything about paying you.
GID00060533	Come on. Let's get out of here.
GID00060534	You're sure you're okay leaving them behind?
GID00060535	What's going on around here?
GID00060536	Goodbye.
GID00060537	I'll go check it out.
GID00060538	Maybe some other time, goodbye.
GID00060542	Yes.
GID00060543	Perhaps another time.
GID00060545	Power armor and laser rifles are still effective.
GID00060546	The Brotherhood is living in the past. Eventually they'll have to change.
GID00060547	If it's worked for this long, there must be something redeemable about their beliefs. Have faith.
GID00060548	None of that is going to change. It's part of the Brotherhood's identity.
GID00060549	Why don't you do something about it?
GID00060550	The Brotherhood has to isolate itself. Its knowledge is dangerous.
GID00060551	Are you still going to travel with me?
GID00060552	It's not too late to change your mind.
GID00060553	Will they take you back after you killed these people?
GID00060554	If you're about to ask me for help, stop.
GID00060555	Why wasn't the data useful?
GID00060556	How long have you been with the Followers?
GID00060557	What do you do around here?
GID00060558	Is there another way to get Mr. House's data?
GID00060561	I've heard some information from its logs, sounds like it is carrying some Enclave data.
GID00060562	I've heard some information from its logs, sounds like it is carrying some Enclave data.
GID00060563	I'd like to talk to you about ED-E again.
GID00060564	The logs spoke about Enclave Duraframe research and Poseidon Energy research.
GID00060565	Let's talk about something else.
GID00060567	A woman named Emily asked me to bug one of your data terminals.
GID00060568	I should let you know that I planted a surveillance device on one of your data terminals.
GID00060573	I took care of them.
GID00060574	I took care of them.
GID00060575	Did you say NCR whores, before?
GID00060576	Let's go back to my other questions.
GID00060577	Goodbye.
GID00060578	Did you say NCR whore, before?
GID00060579	Let's go back to my other questions.
GID00060580	Goodbye.
GID00060581	Goodbye.
GID00060582	I wasn't able to find all of the escorts you're looking for.
GID00060583	<Speech>
GID00060584	My time isn't cheap, Mr. Garret.
GID00060585	Hey, don't I get a bonus or something?
GID00060586	Pleasure doing business with you.
GID00060587	Is there anyone like that in Freeside?
GID00060588	So there's no law here at all?
GID00060589	Let's talking about something else.
GID00060590	What is there to do in Freeside?
GID00060591	Did you have something to do with that NCR messenger getting attacked?
GID00060592	Yes.
GID00060593	Er, no.
GID00060594	So why isn't every man in Freeside in your gang?
GID00060595	I had other questions.
GID00060596	What can you tell me about Pacer?
GID00060597	Who are the important people in Freeside?
GID00060598	Tell me about Julie Farkas.
GID00060599	I'd like to hear about the Garret Twins.
GID00060600	Who are the Van Graffs?
GID00060601	What's the skinny on Mick and Ralph?
GID00060602	Let's talk about something else.
GID00060603	No, General, you keep it in mind - and our conversation is over.
GID00060604	NCR can't hold the Mojave already, and now you're threatening me?
GID00060605	Attack me, and I'll order an attack on NCR at McCarran, the Embassy, and the Strip.
GID00060606	Tell your soldiers you're going to attack Vegas, see what happens.
GID00060607	Then it's best we kill you all now. Securitrons? Please erase NCR from the Dam.
GID00060608	Securitrons - erase NCR from the area.
GID00060609	Because the Generator's destroyed, the Dam is useless to you.
GID00060610	You think these robots are all the forces I have?
GID00060611	<Bluff> Is talking all you can do? I can talk tough, too - real tough.
GID00060612	<Bluff> Because you're talking and not attacking?
GID00060613	Oh, with a crack squad like at HELIOS One? Try it.
GID00060614	<Bluff> Last I looked, that generator was on its last legs.
GID00060615	<Bluff> The generator is beyond repair, trust me.
GID00060616	Even if you fixed the generators, hacking the code won't be easy.
GID00060617	Even if you fix it, you couldn't re-program the power grid, the systems are fried.
GID00060618	I doubt you know how bad the generator is by looking at it, trust me.
GID00060619	Send an engineer down to inspect the turbine and the housing - let them tell you.
GID00060620	While the Boomers fly West? Works for me.
GID00060621	I think how I handled the Legate should be enough for you.
GID00060622	I just stood down Caesar's toughest General... you think I won't?
GID00060623	Once I radio the Brotherhood, they can handle the fighting elsewhere.
GID00060624	Um, well, I'm sure if ask them they'll be on board.
GID00060625	Who's to say? I just suggested coming to Hoover Dam to them, and BOOM.
GID00060626	Look, either you're going to leave, or you're going to fight. So decide.
GID00060627	Well, uh, one percent... are you sure? Seems weak to me.
GID00060628	Really? We should play cards some time, you're bluffing.
GID00060629	It was my duty, General - I was glad to help out.
GID00060630	The Generator's destroyed, the Dam is useless to you.
GID00060631	<Bluff> Seems to me you're doing a lot of talking for someone ready to fight.
GID00060632	Then... the Brotherhood might be willing to help me, I think.
GID00060633	Then maybe the Brotherhood would have more incentive.
GID00060634	I couldn't have done it alone, and I appreciate the assist along the way.
GID00060635	Oh, I think it is... numbers aren't everything, really.
GID00060636	Exactly - and while you've been occupied here, they're ready.
GID00060637	The Boomers might be willing, too... if I ask them. Which I will.
GID00060638	And once the Boomers join them?
GID00060639	Sometimes I wonder if NCR wouldn't lose the whole West if they weren't sitting on it.
GID00060640	<Attack> Actually, nothing of the sort. We've come to exterminate you.
GID00060641	Forget it, let's finish this.
GID00060642	Look, you've got two choices - leave, or fight.
GID00060643	Well, I guess we can talk some more, if it'll settle things.
GID00060644	<Bluff> The fact you're talking me with me says a lot about your willingness to fight.
GID00060645	I have no intention of leaving you empty-handed.
GID00060646	We want the Dam, but the power it generates can be shared.
GID00060647	Maybe we could... give you some caps, from the battle?
GID00060648	What if we give NCR some concessions in trade with Vegas - and the East?
GID00060649	Well, we might be able to open the East up faster if we work harder at it.
GID00060650	We'd also guarantee protection to the caravans - and enforcement of fair trade practices.
GID00060651	The reason we need to hold on to it is because it's very technical. Very.
GID00060652	The reason we need to hold on to it is because it's very technical. Very.
GID00060653	The reason we need to hold on to it is because it's very technical. Very.
GID00060654	There are... technologies in Vegas we may be able to provide to NCR. Not all, but some.
GID00060655	As long as that's not a "no," then I'd take that doubt to your superiors.
GID00060656	You've witnessed what we can do this day to the Legion - we can shut down the Dam, Vegas, and NCR.
GID00060657	If you don't accept my gifts, the technologies rolling into NCR will be Securitrons, I promise you.
GID00060658	What happens now?
GID00060659	I'm going to rest for a bit, if you don't mind.
GID00060660	If there's nothing else, General, I'll head out.
GID00060661	Maybe traveling is in order.
GID00060693	Tell me about the Kings.
GID00060694	Tell me about the Followers.
GID00060695	What is there to do here?
GID00060696	Let's talk about something else.
GID00060697	There's a rumor that there's a feud between your family and Pacer. What's that about?
GID00060698	What do you think of the NCR?
GID00060699	What do you think of the Legion?
GID00060700	What do you know of Mr. House?
GID00060701	What do you think of the Gun Runners?
GID00060702	Let's discuss something else.
GID00060703	I'll be sure to pass it along.
GID00060704	Why not tell her yourself?
GID00060705	Get out of here before you get hurt.
GID00060706	It's fine, Simon. I won't let him get to me.
GID00060707	Care to back that up?
GID00060708	Good to see you, too, Pacer.
GID00060709	Why don't you just get the hell out of here?
GID00060710	Apparently I do. Something wrong with that?
GID00060711	Actually, it does. What are you going to do about it?
GID00060712	Never mind. Just forget I said anything.
GID00060713	Do you ever stop talking tough?
GID00060714	Nah, I've just risen up in the world.
GID00060715	Watch your mouth or my trigger finger might twitch.
GID00060716	Work is work, right?
GID00060717	You've come to the right place. Go on in.
GID00060718	Sorry, we're going to have to search you first.
GID00060719	Have you been drinking, sir?
GID00060720	Well, since you declared your gun, go ahead.
GID00060721	It's company policy. Now are you going to let us search you or what?
GID00060722	Why, do you have something to hide?
GID00060723	Nah, you're fine. Go on in.
GID00060724	I'll keep asking until you start answering.
GID00060725	You still haven't submitted to that search I mentioned.
GID00060726	I asked if you've been drinking.
GID00060727	Never mind. I'm afraid we're going to have to search you.
GID00060728	Are you talking back to me?
GID00060729	Certainly, sir. We need to pat you down for weapons first.
GID00060730	Welcome to the Silver Rush. Go on in.
GID00060731	Sorry, sir. I can't let you in.
GID00060732	It should be fine, go on in.
GID00060733	I'm sure you're a man of your word, sir, but we still need to pat you down. No exceptions.
GID00060734	Your word doesn't matter. It's just company policy.
GID00060735	In a word, no.
GID00060736	I think you may be drunk, sir.
GID00060737	Pardon me, sir my mistake. Go on in.
GID00060738	We'll have to pat you down first, sir.
GID00060739	Go on in.
GID00060740	We're going to have to search you first.
GID00060741	Are you drunk?
GID00060742	Just checking. Go ahead.
GID00060743	No, but you do need to be searched.
GID00060744	How do I know you're not drunk?
GID00060745	Okay, search away.
GID00060746	That's not going to happen.
GID00060764	What's the deal with the snowglobe collection?
GID00060765	You do know Caesar is dead, don't you?
GID00060766	Where does New Vegas get all its electricity?
GID00060767	Why is the terminal on the North wall off-limits?
GID00060768	<WGS cannibalism>
GID00060769	Did you know I killed some White Gloves who were eating their customers?
GID00060770	Did you know some of the White Gloves are... eating people again?
GID00060771	Were you aware that the White Glove Society used to be cannibals?
GID00060773	Was it just me, or were there signs of attraction earlier?
GID00060774	Let's talk about something else.
GID00060775	Who do you think will win at Hoover Dam? The NCR, or Caesar's Legion?
GID00060778	Don't you get lonely here, with no one but Marilyn and Jane to keep you company?
GID00060779	Would you like to scan me again?
GID00060780	It's just business.
GID00060781	I don't like you.
GID00060782	The NCR asked me to get rid of you.
GID00060783	By Caesar's command, you will die.
GID00060784	Yes Man needs you out of the way.
GID00060785	Time for you to die, Mr. House.
GID00060786	You won't be able to control anything, but I'll let you live.
GID00060787	I'll put you back in your tube, good as new.
GID00060788	Thanks for the free advice. Who are you?
GID00060789	Why wouldn't I want to go past the greeter?
GID00060790	Never mind.
GID00060791	How do you like the new job?
GID00060792	Goodbye.
GID00060793	Old Ben has the experience and skill you need.
GID00060794	Any idea where I should look for the sexbot?
GID00060795	What's your story?
GID00060796	Goodbye.
GID00060797	How would you like to work for the Garrets?
GID00060798	Courier? I used to be a courier before I got shot in the head.
GID00060799	Butcher? How did you get into that?
GID00060800	That sounds odd.
GID00060801	Crier? What was that job?
GID00060802	What happened?
GID00060803	That's horrible!
GID00060804	Wrong place at the wrong time, if you ask me.
GID00060805	You said escort? Like armed guard?
GID00060806	So you got paid for sex?
GID00060807	Oh, I could never do that.
GID00060808	Gun for hire?
GID00060809	Let's talk about something else.
GID00060810	James Garret needs a real 'boyfriend experience' for more discerning patrons.
GID00060811	<Speech>
GID00060812	You're a beacon of light in some people's depressing existence! Your work is art!
GID00060813	Aw, c'mon! The pay would be great!
GID00060814	<Black Widow>
GID00060815	Ben, you give your clients a precious respite from the ills of the world.
GID00060816	<Confirmed Bachelor>
GID00060817	Ben, you give your clients a precious respite from the ills of the world.
GID00060818	Never mind.
GID00060819	Hold that thought, General. I wanted to introduce you to some friends.
GID00060820	Think that's great? You won't believe what happens next.
GID00060821	Can't take all the credit, had some help from my allies here.
GID00060822	Have you seen an entire army of upgraded Securitrons, General?
GID00060823	General Oliver, Hoover Dam is ours. Leave at once.
GID00060824	I suggest you leave before my "boys" open fire on your men.
GID00060825	The Dam is won... for me. You and the Legion have both lost this day.
GID00060826	Are you sure that's wise?
GID00060827	I don't want any more violence, there's been enough today.
GID00060828	Retreat, or we wipe NCR off the face of the Dam.
GID00060829	Leave on your feet, or leave wrapped in your flag.
GID00060830	How about I ask these robots to fuck you and your entire battalion with a rocket barrage?
GID00060831	General, the Republic has outstayed its welcome - this land is mine.
GID00060832	I make the laws here now, and my law is simple: No NCR on the Colorado.
GID00060833	I was hoping we could be pleasant about this.
GID00060834	Can't do a worse job than the Republic, that's for sure.
GID00060835	I guarantee I've put more thought into the state of the Mojave than you or anyone in NCR.
GID00060836	My sycophant tells me "yes."
GID00060837	I see. Yes Man, please throw General Oliver from the Dam.
GID00060838	Insults? Tsk tsk. Securitrons, please erase all trace of NCR from the area.
GID00060839	Is that all? Because I've got work to do, and NCR words don't mean much around here.
GID00060840	That day's not likely to come, General.
GID00060841	I didn't take the Dam for you, General - I took it for Vegas.
GID00060842	Mr. House sends his regards, Oliver. He's... expanding.
GID00060843	I can't take all the credit, but it wasn't really a gamble, either.
GID00060844	If that's what makes you feel comfortable, I'm not judging you.
GID00060845	Actually, I took the Dam, General Oliver - with Mr. House's backing.
GID00060846	I don't need your opinions, only your compliance.
GID00060847	You will because the alternative is worse - and useless. Much like NCR.
GID00060848	Ever resisted arrest on the Strip? Then you know the odds.
GID00060849	If you intend to fight, go ahead, it doesn't matter to me.
GID00060850	I already defeated the Legate and the Legion, you won't be much trouble.
GID00060851	If you think you've got any chance of taking Hoover Dam, you're wrong.
GID00060852	Maybe you're willing to listen to reason.
GID00060853	What, Caesar wasn't brave enough to come take the Dam himself?
GID00060854	What, Caesar giving you orders beyond the grave?
GID00060855	I'm here to kill you. The Legion's advance ends here.
GID00060856	Nice mask, can't wait to take it as a trophy.
GID00060857	<Bluffs> But... history has shown defeat is assured. Uh, yours, that is.
GID00060858	<Bluff> Persist and learn what Graham learned at the Dam - and Boulder City.
GID00060859	<Bluff> I think they believe you'll be tricked as easily... maybe easier.
GID00060860	<Bluff> NCR has studied you as they did Graham, and the trap is ready for you.
GID00060861	<Bluff> That strength... other Legates didn't see it either, until it was too late.
GID00060862	<Bluff> The position of your veterans, using the Dam's intake towers - all as expected.
GID00060863	<Bluff> Your success was too easy, though, wasn't it? You think I reached you by chance?
GID00060864	<Bluff> Graham did not smell the C4 until he entered Boulder... he only smelled victory.
GID00060865	<Bluff> How could a lone opponent like me reach you so easily, then?
GID00060866	Perhaps the treachery of your own ranks disgusts you as it disgusts me.
GID00060867	There are those among the Legion that would see you fall as Graham did.
GID00060868	I don't believe this means we'll see the last of you - or the Legion.
GID00060869	If you return East and exact vengeance, it buys the West time - and thins the Legion ranks.
GID00060870	I do not wish to die this day, it is true. But nor do I wish to win through trickery.
GID00060871	When your own must ally with the West in order to remove you? Such treachery must be answered.
GID00060872	I have questions first.
GID00060873	I'm ready to deal with Oliver now.
GID00060874	I will await that day, Legate Lanius.
GID00060875	The West will be waiting.
GID00060876	Whatever... just hurry before NCR finishes their plans.
GID00060877	[Karma] Any man can claim bravery when he outnumbers his opponent.
GID00060878	<Bluff> If you're such a "Terror" of the East, call off your dogs and face me one on one.
GID00060879	[Karma] Why don't you fight me yourself if you've got the spine for it, shithead.
GID00060880	Maybe you'd want something more fair? Like a fair fight?
GID00060881	<Bluff> Uh, yeah, probably don't think you can take me by yourself, huh?
GID00060882	I'm sick of talking, let's end this.
GID00060883	<Lie> It matters - what honor gain be had in defeating a potentially superior foe with lies?
GID00060884	Worth the gamble - now for the hard way.
GID00060885	I'm ready, what needs to be done?
GID00060886	Look... there must be some deal we can make to stop this fighting - it's useless.
GID00060887	You could take the West. *Holding* it is another matter.
GID00060888	So you, uh, think military strength is enough, even without supplies?
GID00060889	And they don't *need* to send an army, your supply lines will kill you first.
GID00060890	So you, uh, think military strength is enough, even without supplies?
GID00060891	The farther West, your strength will fail you, I promise you.
GID00060892	There's no communities to support you in the West - you've seen to that.
GID00060893	Look, you haven't thought the economics of this through, all right?
GID00060894	The settlements West are *not* self-sufficient tribes - they need NCR, and the caravans.
GID00060895	But the Legion... it's destroyed a bunch of... well, towns you need.
GID00060896	Towns? The Legion destroyed Nipton, poisoned Searchlight, butchered Nelson.
GID00060897	No, the taming of the West is what has defeated you - NCR's weakness is their defense.
GID00060898	You know you can't supply all the West anymore than the Republic can.
GID00060899	As Legate, do you really believe that, or are you taking a chance?
GID00060900	Where you see death, I see change - and I see it as a strength.
GID00060901	I have faith. Trade helped us survive the Great War, it will do so again.
GID00060902	So... you'll retreat?
GID00060903	And I grant you that time as well.
GID00060904	I suspect the bear will surprise you in ways... in ways I can't even describe.
GID00060905	This battle is decided, that's why I am here.
GID00060906	Surely there are terms you would hear? Anything?
GID00060907	Move forward? The Legion spent years trying to take Hoover Dam.
GID00060908	Look, my point about Hoover Dam is that it's hard to take, so...
GID00060909	And then what of the East?
GID00060910	Look, you're not listening to me - it's not about the Dam, really.
GID00060911	If you need all the East to crush the West...
GID00060912	Well... except Vegas.
GID00060913	That's an optimistic attitude for a general, and that's how wars get lost.
GID00060914	It is not the strength of the West that will slow you, it is their weakness.
GID00060915	Really? I hope you're not counting on the Omertas to help you.
GID00060916	About time. I was starting to get bored with all this waiting around.
GID00060917	You sound pretty sure of yourself. I don't think it'll be that easy.
GID00060918	Good, because the Omertas' plan was stopped, Vegas is as strong as ever.
GID00060919	NCR's weakness is its size - it'll take your entire army to hold the West.
GID00060920	Fine. Let's hear it, then.
GID00060921	Hope NCR's a lot less entrenched than they seem.
GID00060922	Eventually - but moving your whole army West means losing the East. You can't hold both.
GID00060923	How do you propose we deal with NCR?
GID00060924	There is victory in wisdom, Legate.
GID00060925	If you feel that war matters that much, perhaps you will see differently in time.
GID00060926	I will await that day, Legate.
GID00060927	We shall be here, and we shall meet you on the battlefield.
GID00060928	If you needed someone killed, all you need to do is say so.
GID00060929	I'll see what I can do to convince him the Dam belongs to us.
GID00060935	Is there anything else I should do before the battle?
GID00060936	I'm ready to go to the dam.
GID00060937	Sure is, go on in.
GID00060938	Sorry sir, but I can't let you in. Company policy.
GID00060939	Get the hell out of here, you drunk!
GID00060940	Go on in, sir.
GID00060941	On second thought, I can't let you in, sir.
GID00060942	Is Westside part of New Vegas?
GID00060943	Tell me again about Westside's relationship to New Vegas.
GID00060944	How do people here manage to survive?
GID00060945	Let me ask you about something else.
GID00060946	Goodbye.
GID00060947	How do people here manage to survive?
GID00060948	Let me ask you about something else.
GID00060949	Goodbye.
GID00060950	How do people here manage to survive?
GID00060951	Let me ask you about something else.
GID00060952	Goodbye.
GID00060953	Is Westside part of New Vegas?
GID00060954	Let me ask you about something else.
GID00060955	Goodbye.
GID00060956	How did you become the master of The Thorn?
GID00060957	What's your take on the state of affairs of the Mojave Wasteland?
GID00060958	Let me ask you about something else.
GID00060959	Goodbye.
GID00060960	My mind's thinking about what I could do with you, in private.
GID00060961	What's your take on state of affairs of the Mojave Wasteland?
GID00060962	Let me ask you about something else.
GID00060963	Goodbye.
GID00060964	How did you become the master of The Thorn?
GID00060965	Let me ask you something else.
GID00060966	Goodbye.
GID00060967	How can I pay tribute to you?
GID00060968	How did you become the master of The Thorn?
GID00060969	What's your take on the state of affairs of the Mojave Wasteland?
GID00060970	Let me ask you something else.
GID00060971	Goodbye.
GID00060972	What else can I hunt for you?
GID00060973	How did you become the master of The Thorn?
GID00060974	What's your take on the state of affairs of the Mojave Wasteland?
GID00060975	Let me ask you something else.
GID00060976	Goodbye.
GID00060977	Before that time comes, we have some left to get intimate.
GID00060978	There's nothing "lesser" about what I can do, in private.
GID00060979	Let's go somewhere more private.
GID00060980	I'll bet 20 on Red.
GID00060981	I'll bet 20 on Blue.
GID00060982	I'll bet 20 on Red, Night Stalkers.
GID00060983	I'll bet 20 on Blue, Fiends.
GID00060984	I'll bet 20 on Red, Radscorpions.
GID00060985	I'll bet 20 on Blue, Fiends.
GID00060986	I'll bet 20 on Red, Cazadores.
GID00060987	I'll bet 20 on Blue, Fiends.
GID00060988	I'll bet 20 on Red, Deathclaw.
GID00060989	I'll bet 20 on Blue, Fire Geckos.
GID00060990	I'll bet 20 on Red, Deathclaws.
GID00060991	I'll bet 20 on Blue, Giant Radscorpions.
GID00060992	I don't have enough caps right now.
GID00060993	I don't have enough caps right now.
GID00060994	I don't have enough caps right now.
GID00060995	I don't have enough caps right now.
GID00060996	I don't have enough caps right now.
GID00060997	I don't have enough caps right now.
GID00060998	I want to fight in The Thorn.
GID00060999	I want to fight in The Thorn.
GID00061000	I want to fight in The Thorn.
GID00061001	I want to fight in The Thorn.
GID00061002	I want to fight in The Thorn.
GID00061003	I want to fight in The Thorn.
GID00061004	I've got other questions for you.
GID00061005	I've got other questions for you.
GID00061006	I've got other questions for you.

GID00061137	Okay, bring it on!
GID00061138	I've got other questions for you.
GID00061139	Actually, I already found him. He's dead.
GID00061140	Wow, that... really was something.
GID00061141	That was terrible. Really, really awful.
GID00061144	<Log Playback::Continue>
GID00061145	Yes, please.
GID00061146	No, thanks.
GID00061147	I took care of Mr. House.
GID00061148	You said something about a bunker at the Fort?
GID00061149	Remind me what you said about some bunker at the Fort?
GID00061150	I'll go check it out.
GID00061151	I'll think about it.
GID00061152	The last thing Vegas needs is more robots.
GID00061153	Not interested.
GID00061154	I've recovered the Platinum Chip.
GID00061155	Now that I have the Platinum Chip, what's next?
GID00061156	Goodbye.

GID00061161	Goodbye.
GID00061162	Know anything about Saint James?
GID00061163	I'll pay you for the key.
GID00061164	We girls need to stick together, and this'll be our secret.
GID00061165	You'd say no to a guy like me? And here I thought you were special...
GID00061166	Forget I said anything.
GID00061167	<250 caps> This should be enough.
GID00061168	<250 caps needed>I can't meet your price right now.
GID00061169	I have other things to do.
GID00061170	This building is... interesting. What do you know about it?
GID00061171	Tell me more about him.
GID00061172	If this was a school, what was taught here?
GID00061173	Let's talk about something else.
GID00061174	And that's where you got the name from.
GID00061175	Is that what you guys do, pretend to be this guy?
GID00061179	Goodbye.
GID00061180	You look like you're gathering water. The Westside isn't supposed to have a water supply.
GID00061181	Caught you red-handed. Tell me where you're taking that water.
GID00061182	It's stealing, no matter who it's for. Corporal White found out, didn't he?
GID00061183	Where does Corporal White come into this?
GID00061184	Sounds reasonable, but what about Corporal White?
GID00061185	< Speech 80 >
GID00061186	If something happened to White, tell me. You know it's the right thing to do.
GID00061187	Are you lying, Hector?
GID00061188	You're making me angry, Hector. Tell me about the water - now.
GID00061189	It's okay if you tell me - I won't get you in trouble.
GID00061190	You sure you don't know anything?
GID00061191	Goodbye.
GID00061192	What's wrong?
GID00061193	Sorry, got my own problems.
GID00061194	Goodbye.
GID00061195	50 caps or I walk.
GID00061196	Let's hear it then.
GID00061197	Goodbye.
GID00061198	Where is she?
GID00061199	Goodbye.
GID00061200	I'll see what I can do.
GID00061201	Sorry, too dangerous.
GID00061202	Goodbye.
GID00061203	Uh...where is she again?
GID00061204	Goodbye.
GID00061205	Goodbye.
GID00061206	Goodbye.
GID00061207	Any chance you could help me get into Saint James' room?
GID00061208	Yes! I'll join.
GID00061209	I'm not interested right now.
GID00061210	What does it mean to join the Followers of the Apocalypse?
GID00061211	Sure let me take a look at those magazines.
GID00061212	I'd like to talk about joining the Followers of the Apocalypse.
GID00061213	Not yet.
GID00061214	I think the Followers should support NCR in the coming battle at the dam.
GID00061215	I think the Followers should support an Independent Vegas through the coming battle at the dam.
GID00061216	Would you rather see Caesar's Legion win and enslave everyone?
GID00061217	I'm setting plans in motion which will ensure both the Legion and NCR are pushed out of the Mojave.
GID00061218	They won't have nearly enough doctors without the Followers' support.
GID00061219	The Followers would act as support safely away from combat.
GID00061220	You would act as medical support, safely away from combat.
GID00061221	Part of my plan involves automated security for the region.
GID00061222	This is a golden opportunity for the Followers to spread knowledge and care throughout the Mojave.
GID00061223	How have things been since the battle?
GID00061224	Do you have any work for me?
GID00061225	What happened to the Legion?
GID00061226	Let's go back to speaking of the Khans.
GID00061227	Let's go back to talking about the Omertas.
GID00061228	Let's go back to discussing Mr. House.
GID00061229	Let's go back to talking about the Brotherhood.
GID00061230	What other responsibilities does this office have?
GID00061231	I've been inside the Lucky 38.
GID00061232	I've been invited to visit the Lucky 38.
GID00061233	I've been inside the Lucky 38... but Mr. House and I didn't get along.
GID00061234	I know the Chip upgrades his Securitrons.
GID00061235	The Platinum Chip upgrades the Securitrons - and there's a whole army of them under the Fort.
GID00061236	I used the Chip to put an entire army of Securitrons on standby at the Fort.
GID00061237	Once I get the Platinum Chip, what then?
GID00061238	I have the Platinum Chip, remember?
GID00061239	Where is the Platinum Chip?
GID00061240	Benny seems to have run off with the Platinum Chip.
GID00061241	I don't have the Platinum Chip. Maybe it's on Benny's corpse.
GID00061242	Mr. House has dared me to visit him at the Lucky 38... so he can kill me.
GID00061243	The Chip was supposed to activate an army of Securitrons at the Fort, but I blew it up.
GID00061244	Let me see what you have for sale.
GID00061245	Goodbye.

GID00061251	Let's talk about something else.
GID00061252	Goodbye.
GID00061253	He thinks your experience and technology will help resolve the conflict in this region.
GID00061254	You guys have big guns and are good at fighting.
GID00061255	I'm gathering allies - just in case.
GID00061256	Gonna need more friends, I think.
GID00061257	Why, do you have something better to do?
GID00061258	<Turn on Securitrons.>
GID00061259	<Destroy the dam generators.>
GID00061260	Have you seen Benny?
GID00061261	What's a Securitron doing in a hole in Benny's closet?
GID00061262	"Yes Man?" What kind of a name is that?
GID00061263	How come you work for Benny and not Mr. House?
GID00061264	What's Benny planning to do with the Platinum Chip?
GID00061265	You're very... forthcoming with that information.
GID00061266	Benny stole a platinum chip from me. Do you know what it's for?
GID00061267	Hold still a minute. I want to upgrade your programming.
GID00061268	On second thought, never mind...
GID00061269	Not until you tell me where you get the food from.
GID00061270	I could use some help with my reputation in Freeside.
GID00061271	I could use some help with my reputation in Freeside.
GID00061272	I need people to forget about some things I've done.
GID00061273	I want people to like me.
GID00061274	Never mind.
GID00061275	<Pay 250 caps> Just a few things here and there. I'm no monster.
GID00061276	<Pay 250 caps> Nothing big, just a few things.
GID00061277	<Pay 500 caps> I think they may have gotten me mixed up with someone else.
GID00061278	<Pay 500 caps> Someone is still spreading horrible rumors about me!
GID00061279	<Pay 1000 caps> I must have been possessed by the Devil to have done what I did.
GID00061280	<Pay 250 caps> Just a few things here and there.
GID00061281	<Pay 500 caps> I'm a great guy. I do my best to help those in need.
GID00061282	<Pay 500 caps> I'm a great gal. I do my best to help those in need.
GID00061283	<Pay 1000 caps> I'm a damn beacon of morality here! People should be lining up to shake my hand.
GID00061284	I'm not interested.
GID00061285	I'm all ears.
GID00061286	I'd like to switch to my Pip-Boy.
GID00061287	I'd like to switch to my Pimpboy.
GID00061288	Goodbye.
GID00061289	Tell me about the NCR.
GID00061290	How did you get to be a colonel in the NCR?
GID00061291	What can you tell me about Hoover Dam?
GID00061292	What do you know about Caesar's Legion?
GID00061293	Are you in charge of the NCR around here?
GID00061294	Sounds like you miss it.
GID00061295	It's better to be in charge.
GID00061296	Let's talk about something else.
GID00061297	What impressed you about their discipline?
GID00061298	You mentioned that they were in good shape?
GID00061299	What kind of weapons do they use?
GID00061300	Let's talk about something else.
GID00061301	Where should I start looking for them?
GID00061302	What if I can convince them not to join the Legion?
GID00061303	I wanted to ask you some questions.
GID00061304	What could Mr. House possibly be up to?
GID00061305	What evidence do you have that Mr. House will make a move?
GID00061306	Won't getting rid of Mr. House have huge repercussions for New Vegas?
GID00061307	No, ma'am.
GID00061308	[Speech Check]
GID00061309	<Lie> Colonel Moore is in trouble! She needs help now!
GID00061310	Don't you have anything better to do right now than guard this door?
GID00061311	[Armor Check]
GID00061312	It's okay I'm a friend.
GID00061313	[Lie] I've been ordered to get something for Colonel Moore, let me in.
GID00061314	It's important that I get in there.
GID00061315	<Start Combat> Enough talk!
GID00061316	What can you tell me about Legate Lanius?
GID00061317	What do you know about the Burned Man?
GID00061318	Oh, well. At least I'm good at killing.
GID00061319	What? You think this is my fault?
GID00061320	Tell me about the Burned Man.
GID00061321	What do you know about Legate Lanius?
GID00061322	<Warning 1>
GID00061323	<Warning 2>
GID00061325	I'm not ready yet.
GID00061326	No deal.
GID00061327	I go where I please! <Attack>
GID00061328	No problem, I'll head up by myself.
GID00061329	Put Caesar in a coma.
GID00061330	Caesar wants to talk to me about being sick.
GID00061331	Tell me about yourself.
GID00061332	What do you know about Caesar?
GID00061333	How is NCR doing?
GID00061334	What's the Legion been up to?
GID00061335	Tell me about the rangers.
GID00061336	Do you ever stop talking?
GID00061337	I'm investigating some intel problems for Technical Sergeant Reyes.
GID00061338	I know you're the one who's been manipulating intelligence data.
GID00061339	Do you know anything about the problems?
GID00061340	Can you give me any advice?
GID00061341	How do you coordinate the intel?
GID00061342	Why don't the ranger stations send the intel directly to the troopers?
GID00061343	But you're inventing your own intelligence reports. I've seen the logs and talked to the rangers.
GID00061344	Why did you do it?
GID00061345	Aren't you fighting for the people of New Vegas?
GID00061346	How does spreading false intel help anything?
GID00061347	What do you think I should do about this?
GID00061348	You're dead.
GID00061349	But what does that accomplish?
GID00061350	Too bad. I'm turning you in.
GID00061351	What will you do if I don't turn you in?
GID00061352	What about you and the rangers?
GID00061353	That's crazy.
GID00061354	Caesar's dead. The Legion can't hold itself together for five years, much less ten.
GID00061355	Caesar's sick. He won't live long. The Legion will fall apart a few years after he's gone.
GID00061356	Caesar's dead. What more do you need?
GID00061357	Caesar is sick. Like... really sick. He could drop any day.
GID00061358	You've convinced me. Your secret is safe.
GID00061359	I can't let you do this. I have to turn you in.
GID00061360	Fine. I'll turn you in.
GID00061361	Doesn't matter. Your time's up, Hanlon.
GID00061362	Fires?
GID00061363	Where did he go?
GID00061364	How did a Follower wind up becoming Caesar?
GID00061365	What happened to Graham after Hoover Dam?
GID00061366	Are the Blackfoots part of the Legion?
GID00061367	So that was the end of Graham?
GID00061368	Why are funds tied up at the Boneyard?
GID00061369	What's going on in Baja?
GID00061370	What about the troopers?
GID00061371	Tell me about General Oliver.
GID00061372	Colonel Moore's "way"?
GID00061373	Is Moore in charge of all the NCR troopers out here?
GID00061374	What do the new rangers mean for NCR?
GID00061375	Tell me about the heavy troopers.
GID00061376	Tell me about Nelson.
GID00061377	What happened at Searchlight?
GID00061378	[Continue]
GID00061379	[Continue]
GID00061380	Why do they call Lanius the Monster of the East?
GID00061381	How bad was Graham?
GID00061382	Was Graham a good commander?
GID00061383	What makes the veterans so tough?
GID00061384	Tell me about centurions.
GID00061385	Who are the praetorians?
GID00061386	Have any good stories to tell?
GID00061387	How long have you been in the rangers?
GID00061388	What do the rangers do?
GID00061389	Why are the rangers here?
GID00061390	Okay, what are you supposed to be doing?
GID00061391	What are you actually doing?
GID00061392	There must be something good the rangers have done that you're proud of.
GID00061393	Come on. You must have lots of stories.
GID00061394	So what happened at Hoover Dam and Boulder City?

GID00061402	[Continue]
GID00061403	Thank you, Caesar.
GID00061404	I don't want to decide.
GID00061405	Can I set him free?
GID00061406	You should probably be talking to somebody else.
GID00061407	Where can I find your whores?
GID00061408	Eddie sent me to deal with you.
GID00061409	< Cock your head and grin. >
GID00061410	I'm not going to let you live.
GID00061411	< Speech 30 >
GID00061412	Eddie's just going to keep chasing you. Quit while you're ahead... and alive.
GID00061413	How about you walk away and I'll do the same? That way it's easy on both of us.
GID00061414	Goodbye.
GID00061415	Goodbye.
GID00061416	I'll do it.
GID00061417	I'll need to think about this.
GID00061418	You only want me to deal with Chavez?
GID00061419	You have a deal.
GID00061420	I'll need to think about it.
GID00061421	Does that mean you'll take the law into your own hands?
GID00061422	Goodbye.
GID00061423	Let's finish this, then.
GID00061424	Here you go.
GID00061425	Goodbye.
GID00061426	< Keep holdout weapons. > Sure, here you go.
GID00061427	What if I wanted to take over New Vegas, instead of Benny?
GID00061428	Say I wanted to take over New Vegas myself. What then?
GID00061429	What are the details of the plan?
GID00061430	Say Mr. House was going to suffer an accident. How would that happen?
GID00061431	Mr. House is out of the picture already.
GID00061432	If something happens to Mr. House, I may be in touch.
GID00061433	Let's talk about something else.
GID00061434	Forget the Boomers. I want nothing to do with them.
GID00061435	Which tribes should I "get to know"?
GID00061436	So I should ask these tribes if they'll support an Independent Vegas?
GID00061437	Let's talk about the tribes I should "get to know."
GID00061438	The Boomers have vowed to support me.
GID00061439	The Boomers won't be a problem anymore. I killed their leaders.
GID00061440	I'm familiar with the Boomers. They can be ignored.
GID00061441	Tell me what you know about the Great Khans.
GID00061442	How have the Khans been kicked around?
GID00061443	I need to take some more time with the Khans.
GID00061444	What do you know about the Boomers?
GID00061445	I'll get back to you about the Boomers.
GID00061446	What do you know about the White Glove Society?
GID00061447	I'll let you know when I'm done evaluating the White Glove Society.
GID00061448	Where should I look for the Brotherhood of Steel?
GID00061449	What do you know about the Brotherhood of Steel?
GID00061450	I'm not ready to decide what I want to do with the Brotherhood.
GID00061451	What do you know about the Omertas?
GID00061452	Do you know anything else about the Omertas?
GID00061453	I'll check into the Omertas some more.
GID00061454	I've visited the Khans' settlement at Red Rock Canyon. They can be ignored.
GID00061455	The Great Khans have been wiped out.
GID00061456	I've convinced the Great Khans to support the NCR.
GID00061457	I convinced the Great Khans to leave the Mojave.
GID00061458	I've set the Great Khans on a path of destruction.
GID00061459	I know the Brotherhood. I want them left alone.
GID00061460	I've convinced the Brotherhood to support the NCR.
GID00061461	I know enough about the Omertas to know I want them left alone.
GID00061462	The Omertas were plotting to destroy the Strip, so I killed the conspirators.
GID00061463	I helped the Omertas perfect their plan to slaughter everyone on the Strip.
GID00061464	I spoke to Marjorie and Mortimer. I say leave the White Glove Society alone.
GID00061465	The White Glove Society had a cannibalism problem, but I solved it.
GID00061466	The White Glove Society needed a little help getting back to basics, that's all.
GID00061467	It took some doing, but I convinced the White Glove Society to support Caesar's Legion.
GID00061468	I destroyed the Brotherhood of Steel's bunker.
GID00061469	I'd like you to go back to the Lucky 38 for now.
GID00061470	I do. We'll meet up at the Lucky 38.
GID00061471	I do. We'll meet up at the Lucky 38.
GID00061472	<Companion Protocol::Return Base>
GID00061473	It is. We'll meet up at the Lucky 38.
GID00061474	I should be going.
GID00061476	Let's take our chances. <Untie Benny.>
GID00061477	Let's take our chances. <Untie Benny.>
GID00061478	No, I came to decorate this tent with your guts.
GID00061479	You invited me and promised safe-conduct.
GID00061481	Boulder City stuff.
GID00061482	I killed the Deathclaw Alpha Male and Mother at Quarry Junction.
GID00061483	Never mind.
GID00061484	Goodbye.
GID00061485	You can't have the tapes, but I'll keep them to myself if you leave and never come back.
GID00061486	Let's talk about something else.
GID00061487	Nevermind.
GID00061488	Cachino was talking about big plans for the Family.
GID00061489	The NCR will welcome my help.
GID00061490	He set me up for an ambush.
GID00061491	Benny set me up for an ambush.
GID00061492	Were you aware that Benny hijacked one of your Securitrons and used it to infiltrate your network?
GID00061493	Not interested.
GID00061494	1250 caps it is. <Give the Platinum Chip to Mr. House.>
GID00061495	The Omertas had it coming.
GID00061496	I'll be on my way.
GID00061497	No thanks.
GID00061498	I may know something about that...
GID00061499	When the Legion assaults Hoover Dam, the Omertas are going to massacre everyone on the Strip.
GID00061500	Never mind, I'll check into it.
GID00061501	I kind of helped them perfect their plan...
GID00061502	<Speech to lie to Mr. House about RACKET involvement.>
GID00061503	I infiltrated the Omertas in order to gain their confidence.
GID00061504	Well, thing is... I, uh... they tried to involve me...
GID00061505	It means I have to kill you.
GID00061506	Nothing I can do. Trying to stop them would be a suicide mission.
GID00061507	Wait for them to make their move. Forewarned is forearmed.
GID00061508	Send your Securitrons into Gomorrah and kill off the Omertas' leaders.
GID00061509	The Brotherhood is holed up in Hidden Valley.
GID00061510	I don't want to kill off the entire Brotherhood.
GID00061511	I'd like to ask some questions.
GID00061512	Let's get back to business.
GID00061513	Any recommendations on how to complete the mission?
GID00061514	Is there any possiblity of a diplomatic solution?
GID00061515	I'd like to ask some questions.
GID00061516	I don't want to kill off the entire Brotherhood.
GID00061517	There nothing I can do to protect Kimball?
GID00061518	What should I do in the meantime?
GID00061519	I'll be leaving, then.
GID00061520	I'll do it.
GID00061521	Let Kimball Visit. Whatever happens, happens.
GID00061522	No thanks.
GID00061523	Fine, I'll do it.
GID00061524	I'll be on my way, then.
GID00061525	Okay, I'll do it.
GID00061526	I had my reasons.
GID00061527	<Use Speech to deny responsibility.>
GID00061528	I was set up. The Legion used me as a patsy.
GID00061529	It... it wasn't Kimball, it was an imposter. It had to die!
GID00061530	What more could I have done?
GID00061531	I'll take care of it.
GID00061532	What's this about a dormant reactor?
GID00061533	Goodbye.
GID00061534	Why didn't you restart the reactor earlier?
GID00061535	You already have power. Why is this important?
GID00061536	I'll take care of it.
GID00061537	I'll take care of it.
GID00061538	I'll take care of it.
GID00061539	Why do I need to be there? The NCR has an army.
GID00061540	What's the goal?
GID00061541	Sounds like I get to kill lots of Legionaries.
GID00061542	Do I need to remind you that the NCR hates me?
GID00061543	Goodbye.
GID00061544	I've got proof of what I've said.
GID00061545	Is there any work to do here?
GID00061546	Goodbye.
GID00061547	Goodbye.
GID00061548	How did you know I was in trouble?
GID00061549	I can take care of myself.
GID00061550	You saying I owe you?
GID00061551	Goodbye.
GID00061552	Goodbye.
GID00061553	What do you want from me?
GID00061554	Goodbye.
GID00061555	Some trick without a nose.
GID00061556	Goodbye.
GID00061557	Goodbye.
GID00061558	Goodbye.
GID00061559	Well, don't.
GID00061560	How would you put it?
GID00061561	Goodbye.
GID00061562	Goodbye.
GID00061563	Where does the concrete come from?
GID00061564	Sounds like life in the Legion is tough.
GID00061565	That's quite a story, Jimmy.
GID00061566	How much for your services?
GID00061567	<200 caps> Let's do it.
GID00061568	Not interested.
GID00061569	<200 caps needed> I'm kind of short on caps right now.
GID00061570	Goodbye.
GID00061571	What do you do around here?
GID00061572	Why is your partner called Saint James?
GID00061573	I hear you and your partner are coyotes.
GID00061574	Is this apartment building yours?
GID00061575	Tell me about Dermot.
GID00061576	What do you know about Jimmy?
GID00061577	Tell me about Sweetie.
GID00061578	Goodbye.
GID00061579	Tell me about Pretty Sarah.
GID00061580	I had questions about your tenants.
GID00061581	Never mind.
GID00061582	You work for Pretty Sarah?
GID00061583	Tell me about Sweetie.
GID00061584	Goodbye.
GID00061585	<75 caps> What the hell. Let's do it.
GID00061586	<75 caps needed> I don't have enough caps on me.
GID00061587	No thanks.
GID00061588	What do you know about Jimmy?
GID00061589	What do you know about Dermot and Saint James?
GID00061590	I found this teddy bear in Saint James's room.
GID00061591	Goodbye.
GID00061592	I'm looking to score some Med-X. Can you help?
GID00061593	Tell me about Dermot, your partner.
GID00061594	I hear you spend most of your caps on Sweetie.
GID00061595	<300 caps> Here's your money.
GID00061596	Goodbye.
GID00061597	<300 caps needed> I don't have enough on me right now...
GID00061598	Never mind.
GID00061599	Does Saint James pay you for anything "unusual"?
GID00061600	< Barter 30 >
GID00061601	Let's say 100 caps. Or you could earn zero keeping your mouth shut.
GID00061602	100 caps. Take it or leave it.
GID00061603	All right. 200 caps it is.
GID00061604	All right. 200 caps it is.
GID00061605	I don't have 200 caps.
GID00061606	No thanks.
GID00061607	Do you know Saint James?
GID00061608	Tell me about Freeside.
GID00061609	What can you tell me about the Kings?
GID00061610	How did you join the Kings?
GID00061611	I'm trying to get to the Strip. Know anything that could help me out?
GID00061612	Let's talk about something else.
GID00061613	What about crime?
GID00061614	Don't the Kings run this place, though?
GID00061615	I heard a rumor that there's something between you and the Van Graffs. What happened?
GID00061616	Whoa, now. Watch where you point that thing. It's dangerous.
GID00061617	Good for you. No one should have to be afraid all the time.
GID00061618	Now you'll get some respect. You should give some hell to the people that used to push you around.
GID00061619	No, you could make a real difference.
GID00061620	Freeside's problems are too big for you to have much impact.
GID00061621	You believed that crap I said about giving the money away?
GID00061622	I go places all the time. It's actually pretty easy to just pick up and leave.
GID00061623	You wouldn't last ten seconds out in the waste.
GID00061624	Sure, but what about this place? Isn't it your home?
GID00061625	I'm sorry. Sorry you're such a prissy asshole.
GID00061626	I'm sorry. I was out of line before.
GID00061627	I've already forgotten it.
GID00061628	Very classy.
GID00061629	As good as a ghoul in a suit can look.
GID00061630	I don't care. Do you have any new info?
GID00061631	Sure. What is it?
GID00061632	No right now. I'm busy.
GID00061633	Don't shoot! Here you go.
GID00061634	Why are you doing this?
GID00061635	I'm not giving you my caps.
GID00061636	I have a better idea. Why don't I just take all my caps back from your corpse?
GID00061637	Anyone else missing?
GID00061638	Would you be willing to give me the control tower access key so I can check it out?
GID00061639	Is that a big deal?
GID00061640	What do you think it means?
GID00061641	So you want me to do what you can't.
GID00061642	<Continue Listening>
GID00061643	<Continue Listening>
GID00061644	I'm with the Legion. I'm here to kill you before you talk.
GID00061645	[Attack] Caesar's laws are absolute. He does not grant exceptions.
GID00061646	Very well. I'll try and help you.
GID00061647	But not to me. I'll sever your head and carry it with me always - a message to would-be traitors.
GID00061648	I'm sure it doesn't.
GID00061649	Nasty how?
GID00061650	Fiends aren't enough of a challenge for you?
GID00061651	Goodbye.
GID00061652	Never mind.
GID00061654	I just did what anybody else would've done.
GID00061655	I made a promise to Private Morales.
GID00061656	Now both the Fiends and the NCR know not to fuck with me.
GID00061657	Remind me where Isaac is.
GID00061658	Does it mean anything?
GID00061659	Blake is where, exactly?
GID00061660	Where was I supposed to meet Price, again?
GID00061661	Seen anything suspicious lately?
GID00061662	Goodbye.
GID00061663	What exactly is "funny" about that merchant you want me to check out?
GID00061664	I don't get it. What's funny about a merchant?
GID00061665	What am I looking for in Primm?
GID00061666	How did you end up in this place?
GID00061667	How did the breakout happen?
GID00061668	What can you tell me about the prison?
GID00061669	Where is Cooke now?
GID00061670	What do you know about Cooke?
GID00061671	Goodbye.
GID00061672	Why are you "sort of" the doctor?
GID00061673	What did you do to end up in here?
GID00061674	What did you do before?
GID00061675	What's your reason for staying?
GID00061676	How did you all manage to escape?
GID00061677	What did you do before you ended up incarcerated?
GID00061678	Tell me more about what happened in the prison.
GID00061679	Goodbye.
GID00061680	Who's Cooke?
GID00061681	Where can I find Cooke?
GID00061682	Why are you still here?
GID00061683	Who's in charge of the Powder Gangers?
GID00061684	Mr. House won't give you any more trouble. I took care of that.
GID00061685	Let me ask you more about you and Vault 21.
GID00061686	I want to ask you general questions.
GID00061687	Yes.
GID00061688	No.
GID00061689	So what's the plan?
GID00061690	Where should I start?
GID00061691	What do I do when I'm at the train?
GID00061692	Is that everything?
GID00061693	So where do I find his footlocker?
GID00061694	Let's discuss something else.
GID00061695	Ambassador Crocker said to come see you about the situation with the Kings in Freeside.
GID00061696	He said those were his official orders, but suggested seeing you anyway.
GID00061697	He said you might have a better way of dealing with the issue.
GID00061698	The ambassador didn't think Colonel Moore would handle the situation correctly.
GID00061699	Any other problems?
GID00061700	Where does that leave you?
GID00061701	What's Camp McCarran's role in NCR operations?
GID00061702	Are things mostly quiet between here and the Dam?
GID00061703	What challenges does the NCR face here?
GID00061704	...but relief must follow unbearable suffering.
GID00061705	I'm going to pollute the ventilation system with the strinking corpse of an NCR private.
GID00061706	What are the most dangerous places in the Wasteland?
GID00061707	What are the most dangerous places in the Wasteland?
GID00061708	How do Wastelanders cope with current times?
GID00061709	What are the most dangerous places in the Wasteland?
GID00061710	How do Wastelanders cope with current times?
GID00061715	I'm here to deliver an ultimatum from the NCR. Cease hostilities against the NCR or perish.
GID00061716	The NCR wants you to curb the violence in Freeside. Or else.
GID00061717	NCR citizens are dying in Freeside and the NCR wants you to stop it.
GID00061718	I've been instructed to offer you more resources in exchange for your word that the violence stops.
GID00061719	I apologize for their rudeness. The NCR wants peace in Freeside, and offers additional supplies.
GID00061720	Don't take that tone with me. These soldiers would wipe the floor with your men.
GID00061721	<Lie> No, I haven't.
GID00061722	<Lie> Sure, what about the place?
GID00061724	Can you tell me about Mr. House?
GID00061725	What is this place?
GID00061726	What kind of robots are you?
GID00061727	You look different somehow. Did you cut your hair?
GID00061728	What's with the snowglobe collection?
GID00061729	I've got a snowglobe for Mr. House's collection.
GID00061730	I've got some snowglobes for Mr. House's collection.
GID00061731	What can you tell me about New Vegas?
GID00061732	I know you feel safe here, but I could crush your windpipe before anyone noticed.
GID00061733	I bet I could beat you up.
GID00061734	I know you feel safe here, but I could crush your windpipe before anyone noticed.
GID00061735	I bet I could beat you up.
GID00061736	Sounds like you're pretty fond of him.
GID00061737	I didn't realize robots could have such strong feelings about people.
GID00061738	Let's talk about something else.
GID00061739	So you're... a copy of a dead woman? What exactly do you do for Mr. House?
GID00061740	I really don't want to think about that.
GID00061741	Tell me about the Three Families.
GID00061742	Tell me about the casinos.
GID00061743	Tell me about the other attractions.
GID00061744	What kind of upgrades?
GID00061745	I'd like to talk about something else.
GID00061746	Yeah, it looks great.
GID00061747	It's not exactly what I would have bought for myself.
GID00061748	You look like an idiot.
GID00061749	Probably a weapon, given how dangerous it is around here.
GID00061750	I'd have saved the money, so I could someday get the hell out of here.
GID00061751	I'd have given the money away.
GID00061752	I'm planning on playing some games in the Casino.
GID00061755	Betsy, I need to go on by myself. Are you going to be okay, girl?
GID00061756	C'mon, girl. Let's get going.
GID00061757	Why don't you just shoot your way out of here?
GID00061758	Only all the time.
GID00061759	Goodbye.
GID00061760	Here's the caps.
GID00061761	Never mind.
GID00061762	That's right. I've battled giant mutated animals, crazed raiders, and braved many other dangers.
GID00061763	You don't need toys, I bet you can get a fun game of Boomers and targets.
GID00061764	I'm a vicious velociraptor. ROAR!
GID00061765	I bet when you get bigger you'll be able to fly your own plane.
GID00061766	I have no money for your toll, surely you will let a fair traveller pass through your gate.
GID00061767	<Mock Surrender> Woah, no way I'm fighting with the mighty Red-Brick.
GID00061768	Oh mighty Fantoma, I hope one day I can fight for the forces of good by your side!
GID00061769	Tell me about yourself.
GID00061770	How did you end up joining the Legion?
GID00061771	Show me what you have for sale.
GID00061772	Goodbye.
GID00061773	Goodbye.
GID00061774	Why did Antony take him away?
GID00061775	Goodbye.
GID00061776	Tell Caesar I accept his invitation.
GID00061777	What are the Frumentarii?
GID00061778	The Fruit who?
GID00061779	I'll let you in, later, when you're ready for a night to remember.
GID00061780	Yeah, pass by my room and we'll catch up.
GID00061781	I'm looking for Carlitos. Do you know him?
GID00061782	I'll let you in, later, when you're ready for a night to remember.
GID00061783	I'm looking for Carlitos. Do you know him?
GID00061784	I'm looking for Carlitos. Do you know him?
GID00061785	You know Doc Mitchell?
GID00061786	You know Doc Mitchell?
GID00061787	You know Doc Mitchell?
GID00061788	Do you get a lot of business here?
GID00061789	Get my room keys, and pass by later. I've got something for you.
GID00061790	Get my room keys, and pass by later. I've got something for you.
GID00061791	I need a room.
GID00061792	What's a Securitron doing here?
GID00061793	Goodbye.
GID00061794	I need a room.
GID00061795	Goodbye.
GID00061796	I don't have enough for a room.
GID00061797	I don't have enough for a room.
GID00061798	Why do you say that Vault 21 has come a long way?
GID00061799	Why do you say that Vault 21 has come a long way?
GID00061800	Do you know Doc Mitchell?
GID00061801	Is this change behind your loss of inspiration?
GID00061802	What about you?
GID00061803	I had other questions.
GID00061804	What about Gloria?
GID00061807	What if I helped you escape?
GID00061808	Here's the Stealth Boy and Bobby Pin you need to escape.
GID00061809	If I help you escape, what will you do next?
GID00061810	Keep dreaming.
GID00061811	You're not getting out of that cage.
GID00061812	I'll see what I can do.
GID00061813	Keep dreaming.
GID00061814	About helping you escape...
GID00061815	Here's the Stealth Boy and Bobby Pin you need.
GID00061816	I'll see what I can do.
GID00061817	If I help you escape, what will you do next?
GID00061818	Keep dreaming.
GID00061819	We talked about how you might sneak out of here...
GID00061820	How about I untie you?
GID00061821	Okay, let's do it.
GID00061822	Actually... I'd rather kill you now.
GID00061823	Here, I'll set you free. <Untie Benny.>
GID00061824	I'm leaving you here.
GID00061825	I don't know how to open this cage...
GID00061826	What happens if I let you go?
GID00061827	You're next. Say your prayers.
GID00061828	Time to die.
GID00061829	Goodbye, Benny.
GID00061830	About setting you free...
GID00061831	How about I bust you out?
GID00061832	All right, get ready.
GID00061834	I'm sure you have all the good dirt on what goes on around here.
GID00061835	<Speech Options>
GID00061836	Don't worry about me, I can keep your secrets.
GID00061837	A little gossip never hurt anyone.
GID00061838	<Cherchez La Femme>
GID00061839	Beautiful, I would love to help you loosen those lips.
GID00061840	What can you tell me about what's going on around the Strip?
GID00061841	What can you tell me about what's going on in Gomorrah?
GID00061842	I'm calling in for an outstanding balance for some information. Tell me what the Omertas are up to.
GID00061843	I'm calling in for an outstanding balance for some information. Tell me what the Omertas are up to.
GID00061844	Can you help me find someone?
GID00061845	I'm looking for Cachino.
GID00061846	Can you tell me where Troike is?
GID00061847	Do you know someone named Clanden?
GID00061848	Where can I find the management?
GID00061849	I need to know who to talk to about what's been going on in Gomorrah.
GID00061850	Tell me what the Family is up to.
GID00061851	Let me ask you about something else.
GID00061852	Goodbye.
GID00061853	Goodbye.
GID00061854	Goodbye.
GID00061856	I got better.
GID00061857	Well, I'm not, and I believe you have something of mine.
GID00061858	I want some more answers.
GID00061859	What can you tell me about Benny?
GID00061860	Never mind. Let's talk about something else.
GID00061861	Any chance you're willing to surrender?
GID00061862	What do you know about the Platinum Chip?
GID00061863	I'm willing to hear other suggestions.
GID00061864	Why did Benny betray you?
GID00061865	< Speech - 45 >
GID00061866	Free the hostages now, and I'll have the NCR escort you out of their territory.
GID00061867	If you let the hostages free now, maybe the NCR would just let you go.
GID00061868	I'm a ghost, here to haunt you. Oooooh...
GID00061869	How much money would it take for you to look the other way while the Great Khans left?
GID00061870	Look at it this way - nobody dies.
GID00061871	Yes or no, that's all I want to hear.
GID00061872	Never mind. Forget I said anything.
GID00061873	Done. Here's the caps.
GID00061874	I'll be back with the caps.
GID00061875	< Barter 45 >
GID00061876	400 caps is a less suspicious amount. You have enough trouble here as it is.
GID00061877	Way too much. Bring that price down and I'll consider it.
GID00061878	I'll consider your offer.
GID00061879	Here's the caps.
GID00061880	I'll be back with the caps.
GID00061881	I don't have the caps with me right now.
GID00061882	About that bribe...
GID00061883	If you have any integrity, then you'll honor the deal.
GID00061884	The Great Khans were nice. You have to be nice, too.
GID00061885	Forget what I said. Kill them all.
GID00061886	More complications. Just what I needed.
GID00061887	Moore sent me to talk to you about the Omertas.
GID00061888	Goodbye.
GID00061889	What is this place?
GID00061890	Tell me about the Rangers.
GID00061891	So, you're a Ranger?
GID00061892	Let's talk about something else.
GID00061893	Are there a lot of Rangers in the Mojave?
GID00061894	How does someone become a Ranger?
GID00061895	Goodbye.
GID00061896	I had some questions.
GID00061897	I bear the Mark of Caesar.
GID00061898	Easy, I'm a friend of the Legion.
GID00061899	You just messed with the wrong guy. <Attack.>
GID00061900	You just messed with the wrong gal. <Attack.>
GID00061901	I came seeking yours, skirt boy. <Attack.>
GID00061902	I'm just passing through.
GID00061903	Yes, I'll go before your Decanus.
GID00061904	What's a Decanus?
GID00061905	Not without out fight. <Attack.>
GID00061906	Good thing you're wearing a skirt, makes pissing yourself go easier. <Attack.>
GID00061907	What? Why?
GID00061908	Sure, okay, I'm out of here.
GID00061909	Fuck off, creep, I'm not going anywhere.
GID00061910	Try to throw me out and you'll be leaving - in pieces.
GID00061911	All right, I'm going.
GID00061912	What? Why?
GID00061913	I'm gone, then. Thanks for all the money.
GID00061914	Nevermind, I'll be back.
GID00061915	Any interesting places around here?
GID00061916	What do you do here?
GID00061917	Mr. House sent me to infiltrate your camp.
GID00061918	You guaranteed my safety.
GID00061919	You're in possession of something that interests me.
GID00061920	I need to get that Platinum Chip back.
GID00061921	I had to see the Mighty Caesar with my own eyes.
GID00061922	Death to tyrants! <Start combat.>
GID00061923	That I'd decorate this tent with your guts.
GID00061924	<Inert Node to hold lines for how player has troubled Legion.>
GID00061925	<INERT NODE TO HOLD LINES FOR HOW PLAYER HAS TROUBLED NCR.>
GID00061926	How do you know so much about me?
GID00061927	What's on the other side of those doors?
GID00061928	How may I serve your Legion, Caesar?
GID00061929	Just let me deal with Benny and I'll be on my way.
GID00061930	What were you looking to start?
GID00061931	Just give me back the Platinum Chip and I'll be on my way.
GID00061932	What do I have to do?
GID00061933	Can't your Legionaries take care of this?
GID00061934	Maybe Benny could do this for you.
GID00061935	You should use Mr. House's technology to attack the dam.
GID00061936	Tell me about the Boomers.
GID00061937	Don't you know anything about their society?
GID00061938	What do you think of the Brotherhood of Steel?
GID00061939	Couldn't you use the Brotherhood to your advantage?
GID00061940	What's your opinion of President Kimball?
GID00061941	Isn't it natural for someone like Kimball to seek greater power?
GID00061942	How will the NCR react to Kimball's death? Won't it just anger them?
GID00061943	I've heard rumors of your legate, Lanius. What's his story?
GID00061944	What happened when Lanius attacked his own tribe?
GID00061945	He sounds more like a savage than a general.
GID00061946	What is "decimatio?"
GID00061947	Lanius will lead the assault on Hoover Dam?
GID00061948	Why did the Legion lose the first battle?
GID00061949	I've heard the commander of the first battle called "The Burned Man."
GID00061950	Tell me about Vulpes Inculta.
GID00061951	What do the Frumentarii do?
GID00061952	Are your bodyguards special in any way?
GID00061953	How long has Lucius been the head of your Praetorians?
GID00061954	What should I expect at the dam?
GID00061955	Let's talk about something else.
GID00061956	Let's talk about something else.
GID00061957	Let's talk about something else.
GID00061958	Let's talk about something else.
GID00061959	Why must Mr. House be killed?
GID00061960	I'm done working for you.
GID00061961	I killed the Omertas who were scheming to attack the Strip.
GID00061962	I may have disrupted plans to recruit the Great Khans to your cause.
GID00061963	The Legionaries at Nelson attacked me, so I had to fight back...
GID00061964	I defused the bomb on the monorail.
GID00061965	I've committed no other crimes.
GID00061966	I apologize for my failure, mighty Caesar. It will not happen again.
GID00061967	That's enough questions for now.
GID00061968	I won't fight for the Legion.
GID00061969	Just let me deal with Benny and I'll be on my way.
GID00061970	I should be going.
GID00061971	I should be going.
GID00061972	Just give me back the Platinum Chip and I'll be on my way.
GID00061973	How do you know so much about me?
GID00061974	What are you saying I have to do?
GID00061975	Just let me deal with Benny and I'll be on my way.
GID00061976	Just give me back the Platinum Chip and I'll be on my way.
GID00061977	I should be going.
GID00061978	What are you saying I have to do?
GID00061979	How do you know so much about me?
GID00061980	I should be going.
GID00061981	1 chip for 1 cap.
GID00061982	5 chips for 5 caps.
GID00061983	20 chips for 20 caps.
GID00061984	100 chips for 100 caps.
GID00061985	500 chips for 500 caps.
GID00061986	1000 chips for 1000 caps.
GID00061987	Never mind.
GID00061988	The NCR is letting the Legion get away with slavery?
GID00061989	Does the Legion know you're watching them from here?
GID00061990	Why do you need reinforcements?
GID00061991	Has there been much fighting around here?
GID00061992	Goodbye.
GID00061993	Goodbye.
GID00061994	Fine. Let's talk about something else.
GID00061995	< Speech 30 >
GID00061996	If you don't tell me, someone else will. I'd rather hear your version.
GID00061997	You sure? I'd love to hear that story.
GID00061998	You were too tough to kill, and you'll get payback on the Legion some day.
GID00061999	Interesting. Let's move on to something else.
GID00062000	Pathetic. The Rangers should never have let you become one in the first place.
GID00062009	Get out biatch.
GID00062049	I saw you stealing Dr. Richard's medical supplies.
GID00062050	I could ask you the same thing.
GID00062051	I'm just enjoying a late night stroll.
GID00062052	Sneaking around at night is a little suspicious.
GID00062053	You aren't feral, are you?
GID00062054	Why are you still here?
GID00062055	Can you tell me anything about Camp Searchlight?
GID00062056	I see you're wearing an NCR dog tag.
GID00062057	Have you heard anything unusual about any of the other Ranger stations?
GID00062058	Forget about it. It's over.
GID00062060	It was the, uh... the shifty eyes. Yeah. Dead give-away.
GID00062061	Sure, off to the dam I go.
GID00062062	I'd like to ask some questions.
GID00062063	I'll do as you ask.
GID00062064	Like I said, I'll think about it.
GID00062065	I have some questions to ask.
GID00062066	Whatever happens, happens.
GID00062067	What should I do in the meantime?
GID00062068	Vouche for me? How?
GID00062069	Let me ask some questions.
GID00062070	I think I'll sit this one out.
GID00062071	Seriously, I'm not interested.
GID00062072	Let's get back to business.
GID00062073	Let's get back to business.
GID00062074	Tell me again what you want me to do?
GID00062075	Goodbye.
GID00062076	Goodbye.
GID00062077	Goodbye.
GID00062078	Goodbye.
GID00062079	Goodbye.
GID00062081	Tell me about the Brotherhood of Steel.
GID00062082	What's their purpose?
GID00062083	How did you get to be a member?
GID00062084	What do you do for them?
GID00062085	Do you like being a member?
GID00062086	What's the Codex?
GID00062087	Does the Brotherhood protect people from raiders or other threats?
GID00062088	How do you feel about the other members?
GID00062089	Who is Father Elijah?
GID00062090	How can I best use your skills?
GID00062091	I had another question.
GID00062092	I wanted to talk about the technology we're looking for.
GID00062093	Never mind.
GID00062094	I haven't seen him.
GID00062095	Maybe he's down in the barracks.
GID00062096	He probably ditched you for someone cuter.
GID00062097	What were you doing in prison?
GID00062098	Tell me about the prison break.
GID00062099	Let's talk about something else.
GID00062100	Goodbye.
GID00062103	Goodbye.
GID00062104	Goodbye.
GID00062105	What do you do here?
GID00062106	How could Reyes have been wrong?
GID00062107	Let's talk about something else.
GID00062108	Goodbye.
GID00062109	Let's talk about something else.
GID00062110	Why don't you use your radio to fix your supply situation?
GID00062111	How are your water supplies right now?
GID00062112	Since you have extra, could I have some of that ammo?
GID00062113	Goodbye.
GID00062114	What makes you think you can trust me with security codes?
GID00062115	I'll help. Tell me what I need to do.
GID00062116	I'll investigate and let you know what I find out about those odd reports.
GID00062117	I don't have time to do this right now.
GID00062118	The Rangers' versions of the reports they sent to Camp Golf don't match what you received.
GID00062119	Do you know anything about some NCR supplies?
GID00062121	Who are you?
GID00062122	What are you going to do about it?
GID00062123	Who are you?
GID00062124	Let's see who's pathetic.
GID00062125	All right, here you go.
GID00062126	[Sneak] Sure, take whatever you can find. <Holdout>
GID00062127	Forget it, I don't need to gamble that bad.
GID00062128	I'm going in - touch my weapons, I'll kill you.
GID00062129	Easy to hide weapons?
GID00062130	Why would I need to hide a weapon on me?
GID00062131	Let's see what you have.
GID00062132	Not interested. Maybe some other time.
GID00062133	Goodbye.
GID00062134	Goodbye.
GID00062135	Goodbye.
GID00062136	Goodbye.
GID00062137	I can get weapons past the guards, no problem.
GID00062138	Hmmm... think I could I slip bigger weapons past the guards?
GID00062139	I had some questions about bottle cap currency.
GID00062140	Let's talk about something else now.
GID00062141	Why is a bottle cap press a problem for you?
GID00062142	Are new bottle caps ever made?
GID00062143	What makes a bottle cap genuine?
GID00062144	Here's the caps.
GID00062145	I don't have the caps.
GID00062146	Be calm. I am a friend of the Legion.
GID00062147	You haven't asked what became of Benny.
GID00062148	I'm still working on it.
GID00062149	What was that you said about security systems?
GID00062150	Who are you to tell me what to do?
GID00062151	<Go on.>
GID00062152	<Change subject.>
GID00062153	<Benny's fate.>
GID00062154	<House about himself.>
GID00062155	<Vegas history.>
GID00062156	<Major factions.>
GID00062157	<Secondary factions.>
GID00062158	<Goodbye.>
GID00062159	I'll go get the Platinum Chip.
GID00062160	Goodbye.
GID00062161	I'd like to ask some questions first...
GID00062162	Where do you think Benny's gone?
GID00062163	He set me up for an ambush!
GID00062164	Were you aware that he hijacked a Securitron and used it to infiltrate your network?
GID00062165	Not interested. Good luck getting the Chip back.
GID00062166	What do I do next?
GID00062167	What about Benny?
GID00062168	What about Benny?
GID00062169	What about Benny?
GID00062170	What about Benny?
GID00062171	I'll go back and do as you ask.
GID00062172	What's in it for me to go back to the Fort?
GID00062173	What will I find at Caesar's camp?
GID00062174	I'll do as you ask.
GID00062175	Goodbye.
GID00062176	Let's talk about something else.
GID00062177	I worked out a deal where the Brotherhood will help the NCR defend the dam.
GID00062178	I'm still working on it.
GID00062179	Let's talk about something else.
GID00062180	Let's talk about something else.
GID00062181	I'd like to ask some questions.
GID00062182	Tell me about the Boomers.
GID00062183	The Boomers sound dangerous.
GID00062184	You recruited the Omertas as one of the Three Families?
GID00062185	What were the original names of the other tribes?
GID00062186	Tell me about the Brotherhood of Steel.
GID00062187	Why do you hate the Brotherhood so much?
GID00062188	That's enough about the Boomers.
GID00062189	Why do you care whether Kimball lives or dies?
GID00062190	So why don't you want the NCR President to die?
GID00062191	And if Kimball were to be assassinated?
GID00062192	What should I expect at the dam?
GID00062193	Any speculation on Legion tactics?
GID00062194	Any speculation on Legion tactics?
GID00062195	How will the NCR defend Hoover Dam?
GID00062196	What's your battle plan for the Dam?
GID00062197	I'd like to ask some questions first.
GID00062198	What's next in line?
GID00062199	I need to ask some questions.
GID00062200	I'd like to ask some questions.
GID00062201	I'd like to ask some questions first.
GID00062202	I want to ask you some questions.
GID00062203	Let's talk about something else.
GID00062204	That's enough about the Brotherhood.
GID00062205	What is it that you really want?
GID00062206	I don't need it. Keep your money.
GID00062207	After all I've done, 200 caps won't do.
GID00062208	Having your daughter back should be worth more than 200 caps.
GID00062209	<Attack> I'll take the money from Crimson Caravan as well.
GID00062210	Goodbye.
GID00062211	Sooner or later she'd have left anyway.
GID00062212	[Attack] Give me the Crimson Caravan money, now.
GID00062213	You're alive thanks to me. I expect my reward.
GID00062214	Goodbye.
GID00062215	Actually, just keep it.
GID00062216	For a job well done... 200 caps.
GID00062217	[Attack] Give me the Crimson Caravan money, now.
GID00062218	I don't need it. Keep it.
GID00062219	500 caps sounds right.
GID00062220	[Attack] Give me the Crimson Caravan money, now.
GID00062221	Goodbye.
GID00062222	Goodbye.
GID00062225	The rangefinder might be a problem. I reactivated HELIOS One, and it's not powering a weapon.
GID00062226	There's a corpse nearby. Anybody been near it?
GID00062227	Give me that gun.
GID00062228	I'm a space soldier. The general sent me to ask you to borrow your gun to stop an alien invasion.
GID00062229	You look tired. Maybe you should take a break.
GID00062230	Can I buy that gun from you?
GID00062231	It's worth 1000 caps to me.
GID00062232	Yeah, but your heavy use has really depreciated its value. It's only worth twenty caps now.
GID00062233	I don't have it here. I'll have to go get it.
GID00062234	It's invisible.
GID00062235	I don't think I can come up with that kind of cash.
GID00062236	What if I give you twenty caps? That's... uh... way more than a million!
GID00062237	I'm looking for someone carrying an antique gun.
GID00062238	Hey. You see weird gun? ("Pardon, but have you seen any pre-war firearm antiquities of late?")
GID00062239	These ten caps are yours if you point me to anyone you've seen with a weird old gun.
GID00062240	I would bribe you but I don't have much on me. Would you accept an IOU?
GID00062241	Two choices. You point me to any odd guns you've seen lately, or I paint the curb with your brains.
GID00062242	Why do you call this place your baby?
GID00062243	What do you do here?
GID00062244	What do you think of Fantastic?
GID00062245	Tell me about the last battle.
GID00062246	Let's talk about something else.
GID00062247	Goodbye.
GID00062248	How is the dam running these days?
GID00062249	What is wrong with the other turbines?
GID00062250	Let's talk about something else.
GID00062251	Flipping switches is fun.
GID00062252	Could you remind me where I should look for supplies?
GID00062253	Goodbye.
GID00062254	<Pay caps>
GID00062255	<Pay 50 caps>
GID00062256	<Pay 45 caps>
GID00062257	<Pay 40 caps>
GID00062258	You might want to ask Contreras at Camp McCarran that question.
GID00062259	<Draw weapon> Well, you're never going to find out.
GID00062260	He gave me a package to deliver and now he asked me to kill you.
GID00062261	If Contreras is a scumbag, I want him caught.
GID00062262	Goodbye.
GID00062263	What will happen to him if he's guilty?
GID00062264	There's only one solution: I'm going to take him out.
GID00062265	Can I ask you something else?
GID00062266	Can I ask you something else?
GID00062267	Goodbye.
GID00062268	Can I ask you something else?
GID00062269	Goodbye.
GID00062270	Can I ask you something else?
GID00062271	Goodbye.
GID00062272	I'll think about it.
GID00062273	Can I ask you something else?
GID00062274	Hang on, I gotta take care of something first.
GID00062275	Hang on, I gotta take care of something first.
GID00062276	Goodbye.
GID00062277	Can I ask you something else?
GID00062278	Maybe I can help?
GID00062279	Can you tell me anything about Camp Searchlight?
GID00062280	Can I ask you something else?
GID00062281	Goodbye.
GID00062282	Some caps would be nice.
GID00062283	How about a little pick-me-up?
GID00062284	No charge, just helping out.
GID00062285	It won't be a problem. She's leaving.
GID00062286	Won't stand for what? She plans to respect the Elder's decision.
GID00062287	You don't have a say. Go back in your cave.
GID00062288	Ideals are strengthened by the challenges they endure. Veronica's questioning did you a service.
GID00062289	Uh... Veronica just said those things to test you. She didn't mean it.
GID00062290	This isn't your place. You're neither Head Scribe nor Elder.
GID00062291	I will cast down your Codex and bask in the dying agony of those who hold it dear.
GID00062292	I don't get what the big deal is.
GID00062293	Fine. Let's go.
GID00062294	I should be going now...
GID00062295	You may not know me, but I'm no friend of the Legion, and I'll lend a hand to get rid of them.
GID00062296	Come on. Let me help out. Trust me.
GID00062297	Okay. I'm in.
GID00062298	I don't think I can help you. Sorry.
GID00062299	What happened here?
GID00062300	Are there any towns nearby?
GID00062301	Are you in charge here?
GID00062302	Is there anything I can do to help around here?
GID00062303	You sure you don't want my help with the Legion?
GID00062304	I changed my mind about helping you with your Legion problem. I'm in.
GID00062305	I'd really like to help. And what's the worst that could happen, Nelson stays captured?
GID00062306	Because no one else is going to help you.
GID00062307	I'll do as you ask.
GID00062310	Where can I find Jason?
GID00062311	Nevermind, I'll go looking for your components.
GID00062312	Can the launch wait a few minutes?
GID00062313	Where would you suggest I find meat in the amount you'd need here?
GID00062314	I'd like to talk about something else.
GID00062315	Goodbye.
GID00062317	Thanks.
GID00062318	I don't need any compensation.
GID00062319	Thanks, I appreciate it.
GID00062320	That's not necessary.
GID00062321	Goodbye.
GID00062322	Goodbye.
GID00062323	Goodbye.
GID00062324	Goodbye.
GID00062325	Goodbye.
GID00062326	Goodbye.
GID00062327	Goodbye.
GID00062328	Goodbye.
GID00062329	Goodbye.
GID00062330	Goodbye.
GID00062331	Can I ask you something else?
GID00062332	Goodbye.
GID00062333	Goodbye.
GID00062334	Goodbye.
GID00062335	What happened?
GID00062336	Are there any other survivors?
GID00062337	Can I ask you something else?
GID00062338	Goodbye.
GID00062339	Goodbye.
GID00062340	Can I ask you something else?
GID00062341	Goodbye.
GID00062342	Goodbye.
GID00062343	Goodbye.
GID00062344	Goodbye.
GID00062345	Goodbye.
GID00062346	Goodbye.
GID00062347	Goodbye.
GID00062348	Goodbye.
GID00062349	Goodbye.
GID00062350	Goodbye.
GID00062351	Goodbye.
GID00062352	Goodbye.
GID00062353	Goodbye.
GID00062354	Goodbye.
GID00062355	Goodbye.
GID00062356	Don't you have the authority to command the troopers to go into the camp?
GID00062357	Why take out the hostages?
GID00062358	[Psycho] Funny you should mention Psycho. I actually have a few dozen doses on me...
GID00062359	Sign me up.
GID00062360	Let's talk about something else.
GID00062361	Goodbye.
GID00062362	Why don't you try to rescue them?
GID00062363	I won't do anything dishonorable, if that's what you mean.
GID00062364	Are you interested in cracking jokes or getting something done?
GID00062365	I can... do bad things.
GID00062366	Like I care what anyone says about me. Do you want help dealing with the Legion or not?
GID00062367	You're an idiot if you believe everything you hear. You want my help or what?
GID00062371	< Speech 75 >
GID00062372	Are you really going to ruin what's supposed to be a time of happiness for her?
GID00062373	Oh, come on. She's in love. Give her a break.
GID00062374	< Barter 65 >
GID00062375	Opening up trade with the Boomers would be easier with Janet in their camp, wouldn't you agree?
GID00062376	Janet's wages can't be that much. Why bother keeping them from her?
GID00062377	I need to consider your offer.
GID00062378	You have a deal.
GID00062379	Are work contracts common for the Crimson Caravan Company?
GID00062380	That's all I wanted to know. Let's talk about something else.
GID00062381	What kind of upkeep expenses?
GID00062382	Are work contracts legal?
GID00062383	It seems like that the companies are getting the better deal.
GID00062384	Goodbye.
GID00062385	Will do.
GID00062386	Is there something special about these supplies?
GID00062387	Combining those with chemical cleaners would yield strong chems...
GID00062388	Some of those could be combined with other chemicals to make drugs...
GID00062389	No reason. Just curious.
GID00062390	Never mind.
GID00062391	McCarran has plenty of caps to cover the shipment. They'll deal with the cost.
GID00062392	< Speech 70 >
GID00062393	Give them a deal on the price, you'll have the upper hand in future, more important negotiations.
GID00062394	It's the NCR military. You can give them a deal, right?
GID00062395	< Barter 50 >
GID00062396	McCarran is overstocked with water and fresh vegetables. Arrange for a two for one trade.
GID00062397	What's the problem? They have vegetables - trade them for that.
GID00062398	That's all. Let's talk about something else.
GID00062399	Where does the Crimson Caravan Company get its merchandise?
GID00062400	Do your caravans ever have trouble from bandits?
GID00062401	Where are you from?
GID00062402	The name's [%].
GID00062403	Sounds rough. I'll be heading out now...
GID00062404	Understood.
GID00062405	You've got five seconds to get out of my sight before I shove that rifle where the sun don't shine.
GID00062406	I think it's time to knock you down a peg or two, ranger.
GID00062407	What needs to be done?
GID00062408	Sure, let's play Caravan.
GID00062409	All right, here's your money.
GID00062410	Okay, fix me. Here's 100 caps.
GID00062411	Sorry, I don't have 100 caps.
GID00062412	Here's your money.
GID00062413	Okay, fix me. Here's 75 caps.
GID00062414	Sorry, I don't have 75 caps.
GID00062419	So you work for the Gun Runners?
GID00062420	Who are the Gun Runners?
GID00062421	< Barter 80 >
GID00062422	Arrange a temporary supply deal with other merchants. It'll still lead to a profit for you.
GID00062423	Just buy the supplies from the other merchants around here. Easy enough.
GID00062424	< Speech 80 >
GID00062425	Gun Runners are skilled enough to refurbish weapons like new, right? You're overthinking this.
GID00062426	Just give McCarran some used weapons. I mean, as long as they work, right?
GID00062427	Never mind. Let's talk about something else.
GID00062428	Maybe I could help you out with those supplies.
GID00062429	Any chance I could get a tour of the Gun Runner factory?
GID00062430	Tin cans.
GID00062431	Scrap metal.
GID00062432	Irons.
GID00062433	Pressure cookers.
GID00062434	Metal cooking pans.
GID00062435	Coffee pots.
GID00062436	Hot plates.
GID00062437	Metal cooking pots.
GID00062438	Pots.
GID00062439	Never mind.
GID00062440	Who's in charge of the Gun Runners?
GID00062441	You just shot that man, solely because he insulted you!
GID00062442	That might have been a tad... excessive.
GID00062443	Just the matter of my extra pay.
GID00062444	Goodbye.
GID00062445	I'm looking for work.
GID00062446	I'll take it. What do I need to do?
GID00062447	Actually, I don't have time for this right now.
GID00062448	What other work do you have available?
GID00062449	I'd like to know more about the Crimson Caravan Company.
GID00062450	How long have you been in business?
GID00062451	Does the Crimson Caravan have any competition?
GID00062452	You're well-dressed for this place.
GID00062453	I don't have any more questions. Let's talk about something else.
GID00062454	Tell me about the negotiation.
GID00062455	I want to know more about the problem with Henry Jamison.
GID00062456	What's the Gun Runner job about?
GID00062457	I'll see what I can do.
GID00062458	I'm here to talk about ending your employment with the Crimson Caravan Company.
GID00062459	Goodbye.
GID00062460	What do you know about the Omertas?
GID00062461	< Barter 50 >
GID00062462	The better deal would be for me to walk away and let the Omertas handle you.
GID00062463	What? No way. Pay off the Omertas, sure, but you don't get a single cap more.
GID00062464	Never mind.
GID00062465	Fine. I'll let McLafferty know we've struck a deal.
GID00062466	What brought you to New Vegas?
GID00062467	I don't have the caps right now.
GID00062468	Here's the caps.
GID00062469	Here's the caps.
GID00062470	Here's the caps.
GID00062471	Can you make me luckier?
GID00062472	Here's the caps.
GID00062473	Here's the caps.
GID00062474	Here's the caps.
GID00062475	Here's the caps.
GID00062476	Here's the caps.
GID00062477	I don't have the caps.
GID00062478	Here's the caps.
GID00062479	Here's the caps.
GID00062480	I don't have the caps.
GID00062481	I don't have the caps.
GID00062482	Here's the caps.
GID00062483	I don't have the caps.
GID00062484	That's all I wanted to know. Let's talk about something else.
GID00062485	Are you one of the Followers of the Apocalypse?
GID00062486	Can I make a donation to the Followers?
GID00062487	What do the Followers believe in?
GID00062488	Are the Followers part of the NCR?
GID00062489	Do the Followers have a headquarters around here?
GID00062490	Here's 500 caps.
GID00062491	I don't have the caps right now.
GID00062492	Never mind.
GID00062493	Here's the caps.
GID00062494	I don't have the caps right now.
GID00062495	Here's the caps.
GID00062496	I don't have the caps right now.
GID00062497	Not interested.
GID00062498	<Tell House about Benny's fate at fort>
GID00062499	I want to know more about you, Mr. House.
GID00062500	What was Vegas like before the war?
GID00062501	You say that you saved Las Vegas. How?
GID00062502	What preparations did you make to save Las Vegas?
GID00062503	Why didn't the Platinum Chip arrive on time?
GID00062504	How did you nearly die, defending Vegas?
GID00062505	Who do you think will win - the NCR or Caesar's Legion?
GID00062506	<Secondary factions>
GID00062507	Goodbye.
GID00062508	Goodbye.
GID00062509	Goodbye.
GID00062510	What killed the other troopers?
GID00062511	That's exactly why I'm here, General Oliver.
GID00062512	This doesn't have to end in bloodshed, general.
GID00062513	Then I guess I'd better kill you before that happens.
GID00062514	There won't be any reinforcements. The Legion has blocked the road west.
GID00062515	The Legion has more men on their way as well.
GID00062516	There's still time. You could escape. I won't stop you.
GID00062517	Then let's stop wasting time, shall we?
GID00062518	To what end? You delay the inevitable.
GID00062519	You're right. I guess you're screwed.
GID00062520	I'm betting a man as smart as you wouldn't leave himself without at least one contingency.
GID00062521	You could head down the river, take a boat or something.
GID00062522	Very clever, general. But I already know you have an escape route.
GID00062523	And what about your duty to your men?
GID00062524	Then let's fight already.
GID00062525	Dying won't accomplish anything.
GID00062526	Then I guess we fight.
GID00062527	The dam is already lost, general. Your responsibility now is to get your men out of here alive.
GID00062528	Is this dam really that important? Really?
GID00062529	Then choose, general. Leave now and your men will live. Stay, and you all die.
GID00062530	I'm looking for an antique rangefinder somebody might've sold you.
GID00062531	What kind of collar?
GID00062532	Did you happen to find out where he was from?
GID00062533	What'd you tell him?
GID00062534	What did he look like?
GID00062541	There's still some fighting back there.
GID00062542	The area is secure.
GID00062543	How did you get here ahead of me?
GID00062544	I'll see what I can do.
GID00062545	I'll make my way across somehow.
GID00062546	Just make sure your men don't get in my way.
GID00062547	I found this syringe on Private Stone.
GID00062548	It's better if you turn yourself in rather than me turning you in.
GID00062549	Goodbye.
GID00062550	Goodbye.
GID00062551	Can I ask you something else?
GID00062552	How did the Legion get into the camp?
GID00062553	Can I ask you something else?
GID00062554	How did you survive the attack?
GID00062555	Can I ask you something else?
GID00062556	I have to think about this first.
GID00062557	Can I ask you something else first?
GID00062558	Alright, I'll do it.
GID00062559	Sorry, I can't help you right now.
GID00062560	Can I ask you something else?
GID00062561	Can I ask you something else?
GID00062562	Actually, let me ask you something else first.
GID00062563	Nope, I'm getting out of here.
GID00062564	Sorry, my mistake, I'm still in.
GID00062565	Not yet, but I had more questions.
GID00062566	I'm afraid he's dead.
GID00062567	<Truth> I killed him.
GID00062568	<Lie> The Legion caught him and crucified him. He was dead when I found him.
GID00062569	The Legion caught him and crucified him. I was just trying to end his pain.
GID00062570	I didn't know he worked for you.
GID00062571	It was fun. He made a noise like a deflating balloon.
GID00062572	What do you think about the Khans' alliance with Caesar?
GID00062573	What are you doing?
GID00062574	Can you tell me about the Great Khans?
GID00062575	I'd like to hear some of your poetry.
GID00062576	It sounded like you were writing poetry.
GID00062577	You don't sound too eager for your initiation.
GID00062578	I had some other questions, actually.
GID00062579	Why isn't poetry "Great Khan-like?"
GID00062580	I could ask them for you.
GID00062581	Why don't you go there and find out?
GID00062582	Probably. You seem like their type.
GID00062583	That's not really my problem, is it?
GID00062584	What do you know about the Followers of the Apocalypse?
GID00062585	What is this place?
GID00062586	How does the initiation work?
GID00062587	What does it take to join the Great Khans?
GID00062588	I had some other questions.
GID00062589	I met a kid who's unsatisfied with life in the Great Khans. Will you take him on as a Follower?
GID00062590	Well, he's a poet. Kind of.
GID00062591	He's obviously a bright, sensitive soul, and he loves literature.
GID00062592	None whatsoever.
GID00062593	The Followers have agreed to take you on as a member. Head to the Old Mormon Fort.
GID00062595	Boost my charisma.
GID00062596	Got anything to make people like me better?
GID00062597	I'm interested in the sub-dermal implant.
GID00062598	Sub-what now? I'm interested in that.
GID00062599	I'd like the regenerating ability.
GID00062600	Here's the caps.
GID00062601	Never mind.
GID00062604	<Ask Mr. House why the place doesn't seem to have any power.>
GID00062605	What makes you think Caesar gave me the Chip?
GID00062606	You wanted me to come down here?
GID00062607	Who are you, exactly?
GID00062608	Why did you send me here?
GID00062609	What is this place?
GID00062610	What is this place?
GID00062611	Caesar wants me to destroy this place.
GID00062612	What do you want me to do?
GID00062613	Maybe I should destroy everything down here.
GID00062614	<Use Barter to negotiate for higher reward.>
GID00062615	This work sounds important - and expensive.
GID00062616	I could use a raise!
GID00062617	I'll upload the data, as you ask.
GID00062618	We'll see what happens.
GID00062619	Caesar will kill me unless he believes I blew something up down here.
GID00062620	The Legion took it from me at the Fort.
GID00062621	<Lie> I'm not sure what happened to it.
GID00062622	I'll do as you say.
GID00062623	You're asking me to commit suicide. The Legion will attack me on sight.
GID00062624	What are you asking me to do?
GID00062625	Who are you exactly?
GID00062626	What is this place?
GID00062627	Goodbye.
GID00062628	Goodbye.
GID00062629	What did you say this place was, again?
GID00062630	Goodbye.
GID00062631	Goodbye means goodbye.
GID00062632	What are you doing here?
GID00062633	Caesar wants me to destroy this place.
GID00062634	What will you do with your Securitrons?
GID00062635	What was that you said about security systems?
GID00062636	I'm going to do as Caesar asks and blow everything up down here.
GID00062637	I'll upload the data, as you ask.
GID00062638	Nope, I'm going to blow it all up anyways.
GID00062639	Caesar will kill me unless he believes I blew something up down here.
GID00062640	What if I destroy all three?
GID00062641	There was never any chance. His mind was made up from the start.
GID00062642	Maybe if we make a stronger case, he'll change his mind.
GID00062643	You just weren't very persuasive.
GID00062644	Would someone else listen to you?
GID00062645	Where does that leave you?
GID00062646	You should take over.
GID00062647	This is your home, and these are your friends. You should stay.
GID00062648	Leaving now is your only shot at a future.
GID00062649	You're the only one who can make this decision.
GID00062650	My friend is part of a group that can develop it into something safe everyone can benefit from.
GID00062651	What's this about?
GID00062652	Okay, I'll go visit him as soon as I can.
GID00062653	Forget it, I'm not interested.
GID00062654	What alliance?
GID00062655	What's your role in Caesar's Legion?
GID00062656	What does the Legion want with the Great Khans?
GID00062657	I had some other questions.
GID00062658	This is a great honor. I don't know what to say.
GID00062659	Maybe you could give me the short version.
GID00062660	On second thought, let's talk about something else.
GID00062661	How did the Three Families defeat you?
GID00062662	What happened at Bitter Springs?
GID00062663	That doesn't sound like something the NCR would order.
GID00062664	That's horrible!
GID00062665	I don't want that kind of responsibility.
GID00062666	What did you mean about Papa's hatred poisoning his mind?
GID00062667	Tell me about Bitter Springs.
GID00062668	Never mind, I have other questions.
GID00062669	What kind of doubts?
GID00062670	We fight for Caesar.
GID00062671	We fight for the NCR.
GID00062672	I'm giving leadership to you. I want you to take the tribe north, and find yourselves a new life.
GID00062673	We fight for ourselves. Bring our warriors to the battle and kill everyone.
GID00062679	What do you think about Caesar?
GID00062687	Goodbye.
GID00062688	Transplant Rey's brain into Rex.
GID00062689	Transplant Lupa's brain into Rex.
GID00062690	Transplant Violetta's brain into Rex.
GID00062691	Tell me about the co-op.
GID00062693	What's your story?
GID00062694	Whose idea was it to use the kid?
GID00062695	What went down with Anderson and Corporal White?
GID00062696	I'm leaving.
GID00062697	I'm going to have a chat with Anderson. Don't worry.
GID00062698	[Say nothing.]
GID00062699	Hope you're not too attached to this place.
GID00062700	Goodbye.
GID00062701	Goodbye.
GID00062702	What alliance?
GID00062703	Why are things so tough?
GID00062704	Let's talk about something else.
GID00062705	So you're drug dealers?
GID00062706	Who do you sell to?
GID00062707	Good to know. I had some other questions.
GID00062708	Okay then, what do you make?
GID00062709	What's "the magic?"
GID00062710	Never mind.
GID00062711	You're drug dealers?
GID00062712	How'd you get into this business?
GID00062713	Who's Diane?
GID00062714	Who's Jerry?
GID00062715	Good to know. Let's talk about something else.
GID00062716	I've come with an offer of alliance from the Powder Gangers at Vault 19.
GID00062717	Give me one good reason not to kill you.
GID00062718	Maybe that's why I broke into the weapons locker.
GID00062719	Guess who broke into the confiscated weapons locker?
GID00062720	What's the alternative?
GID00062721	Oh, there's a need for violence. <Attack Benny.>
GID00062722	What's your point?
GID00062723	Goodbye.
GID00062724	I'd like to have greater strength.
GID00062725	I'd like to have more muscles.
GID00062726	Make me more perceptive.
GID00062727	Make me see better.
GID00062728	Increase my endurance.
GID00062729	Can you make me tougher?
GID00062730	I want to be more intelligent.
GID00062731	I want to be smarter.
GID00062732	Enhance my agility.
GID00062733	Do you have something to make me quicker?
GID00062734	Never mind.
GID00062735	Hundreds of Securitrons. All of them upgraded now, thanks to the Chip.
GID00062736	What is it?
GID00062737	Not now.
GID00062738	What did you want to talk about earlier?
GID00062739	I'll take you back there, first chance I get.
GID00062740	Can it wait?
GID00062741	Why don't you just go back on your own?
GID00062742	That's just not important right now.
GID00062743	I'm ready to take you to Hidden Valley.
GID00062744	All right, I'll go.
GID00062745	I have things I need to do. You'd better go alone.
GID00062746	What now?
GID00062747	You think the Elder will listen at all?
GID00062748	What could we bring to him that would change his mind?
GID00062749	So what is it you're trying to accomplish?
GID00062750	How would you propose to do that?
GID00062751	Father Elijah?
GID00062752	Tell me about the rangefinder.
GID00062753	Let's head out.
GID00062754	Good intentions don't justify marching the Brotherhood to its death.
GID00062755	Have you considered that he might be right?
GID00062756	What's a pulse gun?
GID00062757	Farming technology?
GID00062758	Let's pursue the pulse gun.
GID00062759	The rangefinder sounds promising.
GID00062760	We should go after the vegetation technology.
GID00062761	Actually, the rangefinder might be a better idea.
GID00062762	I changed my mind. Let's go after the farming tech.
GID00062763	Maybe the pulse gun would be a smarter move.
GID00062764	Let's go find it.
GID00062765	The Powder Gangers have access to large quantities of explosives, which they'd be willing to share.
GID00062766	Bombs. Lots of bombs.
GID00062767	I found a Legion camp at Cottonwood Cove.
GID00062768	Is there anything you need done?
GID00062769	I already took care of the camp.
GID00062770	I think I can handle that for you.
GID00062771	Maybe later.
GID00062772	I released some barrels of radioactive waste.
GID00062773	I can help you with Cottonwood Cove.
GID00062774	I have an update on Cottonwood Cove.
GID00062775	[Give intel] I planted the bug in Cottonwood Cove's radio and found some intel.
GID00062776	Is there anything else you need done?
GID00062777	I already took care of the camp.
GID00062778	Consider it done.
GID00062779	I'll see what I can do.
GID00062780	Maybe later.
GID00062781	[Give Aurelius' old intel] I planted the bug and found some paperwork.
GID00062782	Nothing new to report.
GID00062783	I killed everyone in the camp.
GID00062784	I released some barrels of radioactive waste.
GID00062785	I just killed everyone the old-fashioned way.
GID00062786	I can clear out Cottonwood Cove for you.
GID00062788	I'm looking for something that could inspire the Great Khans. Know of anything like that?
GID00062789	Who is Ezekiel?
GID00062790	Where can I find this Ezekiel?
GID00062791	On second thought, never mind.
GID00062792	Julie Farkas said you might know something about the Great Khans.
GID00062793	Goodbye.
GID00062794	Goodbye.
GID00062795	How have they been harassing the town?
GID00062796	What are they doing to the town?
GID00062797	You're sure these mercenaries work for the NCR?
GID00062798	Why can't you just take them out?
GID00062799	What do you want me to do?
GID00062800	I'll see what I can do.
GID00062801	I'd rather not get involved.
GID00062802	Goodbye.
GID00062803	Goodbye.
GID00062804	What do you want with Jacobstown?
GID00062805	Who are you doing this for?
GID00062806	I hear you're mercenaries. Will caps make you go away?
GID00062807	I'm sure you two can settle this.
GID00062809	Goodbye.
GID00062810	Hey, you said you would help clear the caves.
GID00062811	Well, have a safe trip.
GID00062812	You said I could have your rifle before you go.
GID00062813	Why the rush to leave? You said you would help clear the caves.
GID00062814	You said I could have your rifle before you go.
GID00062816	It can't be as hard as all that. What needs to get done?
GID00062817	Okay, let's get them out to the range.
GID00062818	Never mind, I'll talk to the others about their ideas first.
GID00062819	I'm sure. Let's do it.
GID00062820	Human niceness?
GID00062821	That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
GID00062822	What do you mean?
GID00062823	So you think I should find ways to convince the Misfits to get along?
GID00062824	Okay, I'll try to convince them.
GID00062825	On second thought, I'll ask around first.
GID00062826	I'll do it. Work is overrated anyways.
GID00062827	Maybe I'll ask around a little more instead.
GID00062828	Angry... juice?
GID00062829	Okay, tell me where to get it.
GID00062830	I'm convinced this is a good idea, let's do it.
GID00062831	On second thought, I'll talk to the others first.
GID00062832	They have a point, it is their armor. You should give it back.
GID00062833	You should listen to them. They have lasers, you know.
GID00062834	I'll find you when you're done here.
GID00062835	Would it be so bad to lend them the armor for the battle?
GID00062836	Not yet.
GID00062837	What exactly are we looking for here?
GID00062838	I found some NCR stuff.
GID00062839	I think this is everything.
GID00062840	Now what are we looking for?
GID00062841	I found more NCR stuff.
GID00062842	This is all I could find.
GID00062843	This is fascinating. Please continue.
GID00062844	Can I get the abridged version?
GID00062845	I'd love to hear your dissertation, but I'm in a bit of a hurry.
GID00062847	Razz wants the usual.
GID00062848	Doctor Henry wants to know if you'll continue to wear the Mark II prototype.
GID00062849	There's a risk that the mental damage will be permanent.
GID00062850	You can always say no.
GID00062851	All right, if you're sure. Let's talk about something else.
GID00062852	Give me some time to figure things out and we'll try again.
GID00062853	Don't worry, I'm not giving up. Let's try it again.
GID00062854	< Science 90 >
GID00062855	Use neuro-peptide stimulators on a Nightstalker brain. Results should be similar to a live brain.
GID00062856	You said Nightstalker brains were similar. What about just testing those?
GID00062857	That doesn't sound so bad.
GID00062858	It sounds like you're not happy being a Great Khan. Maybe you'd be happier someplace else.
GID00062859	Maybe you should just ditch this place.
GID00062860	Why don't you just cheat?
GID00062861	Just wait here a minute, I'll be back with some Med-X.
GID00062862	<Give Med-X> Painkillers like these, you mean?
GID00062863	Well then, never mind.
GID00062864	I'd like to join the Great Khans.
GID00062865	No, tell me what I have to do.
GID00062866	Run that by me again.
GID00062867	I've got it. Let's do this.
GID00062868	On second thought, never mind.
GID00062871	What is this all about?
GID00062872	I don't have time to talk right now.
GID00062873	What opportunity is that?
GID00062881	So where does this put the two of us?
GID00062882	You cheating bastard.
GID00062883	You're a dead man.
GID00062884	Mr. House wants the Platinum Chip. Hand it over.
GID00062885	<Kill Benny in his sleep.>
GID00062886	<Speech check to get Benny to back off.>
GID00062887	All I am is a courier trying to fulfill my contract.
GID00062888	But... I'm not mad. Really, I'm not mad!
GID00062889	The least you could do is answer some questions first.
GID00062890	<Speech check to really convince him.>
GID00062891	I "dig your line." Let me live, you'll never see me again.
GID00062892	My skull isn't thick to forgiveness! Um...
GID00062893	<Go to sleep.>
GID00062894	Call it luck and leave it at that.
GID00062895	What is the Platinum Chip?
GID00062896	What angle are you playing?
GID00062897	Hand over the Platinum Chip, maybe you live.
GID00062898	Your little ambush didn't go according to plan.
GID00062899	I'm coming for you, Benny.
GID00062900	Yeah, it's a real mess here - four bodies.
GID00062901	You'll answer my questions now, not later.
GID00062902	The jig's up, Benny. Me and Yes Man had a talk.
GID00062903	It takes more than a couple bullets in the head to stop me.
GID00062904	A Securitron dug me up and a doc in Goodsprings did the rest.
GID00062905	I'm persistent, that's all.
GID00062906	There's no need for violence.
GID00062907	You cheating bastard.
GID00062908	You're a dead man.
GID00062909	No deal. Time to die.
GID00062910	Why would I trust you?
GID00062911	All right, I'll meet you in the Presidential Suite.
GID00062912	Hand over the Chip or else.
GID00062918	Let's talk about something else.
GID00062919	Tell me about yourself, before it's too late.
GID00062920	Do you have a preference?
GID00062921	I haven't made up my mind.
GID00062922	I was thinking I might hack you to death while you're still tied up.
GID00062923	Crucifixion is an option.
GID00062924	Maybe we should fight it out in the arena, fair and square.
GID00062925	What if my choice is "none of the above?"
GID00062926	Why shouldn't Mr. House run Vegas?
GID00062927	Mr. House is already out of the picture.
GID00062928	What's so bad about the NCR?
GID00062929	You think Caesar would destroy the Strip?
GID00062930	Tell me about the Three Families.
GID00062931	How long were you the head of the family?
GID00062932	Was your tribe always called the Chairmen?
GID00062933	How did Mr. House introduce himself?
GID00062934	<Yes.>
GID00062935	<I can give you a few moments.>
GID00062936	I'm going to hack you to death while you're tied up, helpless.
GID00062937	You'll be crucified for my amusement.
GID00062938	We'll fight in the arena, fair and square.
GID00062939	I've decided to kill you here and now.
GID00062940	It's going to hurt. A lot. <Final decision.>
GID00062941	I could crucify you instead.
GID00062942	Pass the time thinking over your mistakes. <Final decision.>
GID00062943	Maybe I should hack you to death while you're bound helpless.
GID00062944	Let's do it. <Final decision.>
GID00062945	Sure, here it comes.
GID00062946	Something bad could happen to you right here...
GID00062947	Close your eyes, if you want.
GID00062948	You were amazing.
GID00062949	I didn't come here to reminisce.
GID00062950	I didn't come here to remember that stuff.
GID00062951	Sorry, Benny, didn't make much of an impression.
GID00062952	It is pretty funny.
GID00062953	I'll laugh later. We have business to discuss.
GID00062954	You have no one to blame but yourself.
GID00062955	Looks like you played past your abilities.
GID00062956	He gave me the Platinum Chip.
GID00062957	Caesar says I get to decide how you die.
GID00062958	What happened after you fled the Tops?
GID00062959	Tell me about the factions that want to rule Vegas.
GID00062960	Who is everybody who wants to get Vegas?
GID00062961	What do you think I should do with the Chip?
GID00062962	Caesar says I get to decide how you die.
GID00062963	I want to know more about you.
GID00062964	Tell me about the factions that want to rule Vegas.
GID00062965	Who is everybody who wants to get Vegas?
GID00062966	I haven't made up my mind.
GID00062967	I could have you brought before me hog-tied, then hack you to death.
GID00062968	How do you feel about crucifixion?
GID00062969	Maybe we should face each other in the arena, fair and square.
GID00062970	Something bad could happen to you right here...
GID00062971	There were hundreds of Securitrons down there - until I blew them up.
GID00062972	Hundreds of Securitrons. All of them upgraded now, just like Mr. House wants.
GID00062973	None of your business. It's time for you to die.
GID00062974	I have to decide what happens to you now.
GID00062975	On second thought, maybe I should fight you in the arena.
GID00062976	Or I could kill you right now, while your hands are bound.
GID00062977	Did you still want to help Doctor Henry run his experiment?
GID00062978	Why Lily and not some other Nightkin?
GID00062979	I'll talk to Lily, then.
GID00062980	What are the risks of the experiment?
GID00062981	Why is the Stealth Boy Mark II riskier?
GID00062982	I need to think about this.
GID00062992	I killed them all.
GID00062993	They seemed all right.
GID00062994	I'm reserving judgment.
GID00062995	I don't care for them.
GID00062996	I've heard they shoot lasers from their eyes.
GID00062997	I don't really know anything about them.
GID00062998	The Strip.
GID00062999	Hoover Dam.
GID00063000	I just kind of drift from place to place.
GID00063001	What's it to you?
GID00063002	I go where I'm needed.
GID00063003	Going to see an old friend.
GID00063004	You don't look like much. What do you bring to the table?
GID00063005	Where are you hoping to go?
GID00063006	Okay, let's travel together.
GID00063007	I'd like to, but I can't take you with me right now.
GID00063008	Not interested.
GID00063009	Don't you have a family to feed?
GID00063010	I'm ready to travel with you.
GID00063011	Let's go.
GID00063012	Actually, I'm more comfortable now that I know you've had some training.
GID00063013	As long as you're honest with me from now on.
GID00063014	Yes, but you're on a short leash.
GID00063015	Absolutely not. You misled me on purpose.
GID00063016	Tell me about yourself.
GID00063017	I have questions I wanted to ask you.
GID00063018	Ever heard of Mr. House before?
GID00063019	Can you tell me anything about this platinum chip?
GID00063020	Ever hear of a guy called Benny?
GID00063021	Know anything about New Vegas?
GID00063022	What do you think of the NCR?
GID00063023	Any thoughts about Caesar's Legion?
GID00063024	Never mind.
GID00063025	Let's keep moving.
GID00063026	Ok, I'll take care of him.
GID00063027	Can you offer any additional support?
GID00063028	The risk to Lily is too great. Don't keep running the test.
GID00063029	I think Lily should continue to wear the Mark II prototype.
GID00063030	What do you want to do?
GID00063031	Let me think about this.
GID00063032	What will happen to Lily?
GID00063033	What's going on here?
GID00063034	Tell me about Cooke.
GID00063035	Who are you?
GID00063036	Got any work?
GID00063037	What did you do?
GID00063038	How did you get out?
GID00063039	Who's Cooke?
GID00063040	Tell me about the prison break.
GID00063041	Who's Cooke?
GID00063042	Who is Samuel Cooke?
GID00063043	Tell me about the prison break.
GID00063044	Why were you in prison?
GID00063045	Why do you want to surrender?
GID00063046	Why don't you join the Great Khans?
GID00063047	Let's talk about something else.
GID00063048	Goodbye.
GID00063049	Let's talk about something else.
GID00063050	Goodbye.
GID00063051	Let's talk about something else.
GID00063052	Goodbye.
GID00063053	Let's talk about something else.
GID00063054	Goobye.
GID00063055	What's going on around here?
GID00063056	Let's talk about something else.
GID00063057	Goodbye.
GID00063058	I've come here looking for work.
GID00063059	Let's talk about something else.
GID00063060	Goodbye.
GID00063061	Let's talk about something else.
GID00063062	Goodbye.
GID00063063	Let's talk about something else.
GID00063064	Goodbye.
GID00063065	Let's talk about something else.
GID00063066	Goodbye.
GID00063067	Let's talk about something else.
GID00063068	Goodbye.
GID00063069	Goodbye.
GID00063070	Goodbye.
GID00063071	May I ask you some questions?
GID00063072	Goodbye.
GID00063073	You're doing the right thing.
GID00063074	May I ask you some questions?
GID00063075	Goodbye.
GID00063076	What if you joined the Great Khans?
GID00063077	Goodbye.
GID00063078	What's going on around here?
GID00063079	Got any work?
GID00063080	I took care of those geckos.
GID00063081	Goodbye.
GID00063082	What is this initiation?
GID00063083	Would you mind if I borrowed him to check out the area?
GID00063084	How do you get his coat so shiny?
GID00063085	It's okay, I'm good with animals.
GID00063086	Come on, it's just a dog.
GID00063087	Nevermind.
GID00063088	I have other questions.
GID00063089	Thanks for letting me borrow your dog.
GID00063090	Anything I can do to help around here?
GID00063091	I need repairs.
GID00063092	Goodsprings.
GID00063093	The grave.
GID00063094	I'm not entirely sure.
GID00063095	None of your business.
GID00063096	You live in a hole in the ground?
GID00063097	So you just leave your family in the bunker?
GID00063098	Go ahead.
GID00063099	I'd rather you didn't.
GID00063100	Some other time, maybe.
GID00063101	What did you want to ask me earlier?
GID00063102	I met a group of them in a bunker west of here.
GID00063103	They're usually harmless unless you use advanced technology around them.
GID00063104	They're enemies of the NCR. If you know where they are you should turn them in.
GID00063105	They've got the right idea.
GID00063106	I know who they are but I don't care about their agenda.
GID00063107	Yeah. I know to shoot them on sight.
GID00063108	Not really.
GID00063109	Why can't you do it?
GID00063110	I'll do it.
GID00063111	Why would you want to do that?
GID00063112	Let's talk about something else.
GID00063113	Goodbye.
GID00063114	Yes.
GID00063115	Why do you want to seal off the sulfur?
GID00063116	Yes.
GID00063117	Why can't you seal off the sulfur yourself?
GID00063118	Let's talk about something else.
GID00063119	Goodbye.
GID00063120	Let's talk about something else.
GID00063121	Goodbye.
GID00063122	Goodbye.
GID00063123	Yes.
GID00063124	I'm working on it, but I had some questions.
GID00063125	Goodbye.
GID00063126	The Khans will accept you as long as you pass the initiation rite.
GID00063127	I'm still working on it. May I ask you some questions?
GID00063128	Goodbye.
GID00063129	Why do you want to surrender?
GID00063130	Let's talk about something else.
GID00063131	Goodbye.
GID00063132	Have you considered joining the Great Khans?
GID00063133	You're doing the right thing.
GID00063134	You're right, it is.
GID00063135	Sure, I'll go talk to them.
GID00063136	Goodbye.
GID00063137	Goodbye.
GID00063138	Goodbye.
GID00063139	Goodbye.
GID00063140	May I ask you a few questions first?
GID00063141	Goodbye.
GID00063142	What's going on here?
GID00063143	Do you know anything about this vault?
GID00063144	Who are you?
GID00063145	Tell me about NCR.
GID00063146	Got any work?
GID00063147	Tell me about Lem.
GID00063148	Who's Lem?
GID00063149	How did you end up in prison?
GID00063150	Tell me about the prison break.
GID00063151	Why do you hate the NCR?
GID00063152	Why did you kill Lem?
GID00063153	Why can't you do it?
GID00063154	What do you want the sulfur for?
GID00063155	Yes.
GID00063156	Yes.
GID00063157	Why do you want to join the Great Khans?
GID00063158	I'll do it.
GID00063159	I'll do it.
GID00063160	Yes.
GID00063161	Let's talk about something else.

GID00063166	Let's talk about something else.
GID00063167	Why can't you do it?
GID00063168	What do you need the sulfur for?
GID00063169	So, what brought you to this place?
GID00063170	Tell me about the area outside the vault.
GID00063171	Let's talk about something else.
GID00063172	Goodbye.
GID00063173	Let's talk about something else.
GID00063174	Goodbye.

GID00063179	Tell me about McCarran.
GID00063180	Tell me about the Great Khans.
GID00063181	Why's the area so dangerous?
GID00063182	Tell me about the super mutants.
GID00063183	Why do you hate the NCR so much anyway?
GID00063184	Tell me about the problems with Lem.

GID00063233	Goodbye.
GID00063234	Let's talk about something else.
GID00063235	Goodbye.
GID00063236	What's going on around here?
GID00063237	Got any work?
GID00063238	May I ask you some questions?
GID00063239	Goodbye.
GID00063240	What's got you so worked up?
GID00063241	I'm just another wastelander looking for work.
GID00063242	Goodbye.
GID00063243	May I ask you some questions?
GID00063244	Goodbye.
GID00063245	Yes.
GID00063246	I'm working on it, may I ask you some questions?
GID00063247	Goodbye.
GID00063248	Yes. You can join then, but he says you would all still have to pass the initiation rite.
GID00063249	I'm still working on it, may I ask you some questions?
GID00063250	Goodbye.
GID00063251	Sure, what do you need done?
GID00063252	Not right now, may I ask you some questions?
GID00063253	Goodbye.
GID00063254	Goodbye.
GID00063255	Nothing, I'm just passing through.
GID00063256	I'm hunting ghouls.
GID00063257	Why the hostility?
GID00063258	Maybe I can help?
GID00063259	Can you tell me anything about Camp Searchlight?
GID00063260	Who is your employer?
GID00063261	I could ask you the same thing.
GID00063262	Are you looking for something?
GID00063263	Goodbye.
GID00063264	What are you looking for in the computer?
GID00063265	I'll check it out.
GID00063266	I can do that.
GID00063267	I'd better get a bigger share for this.
GID00063268	Fine, I'll do it.
GID00063269	Okay. I'll be back.
GID00063270	Yeah, I'm ready.
GID00063271	Hang on, I gotta take care of something first.
GID00063272	Can I ask you something before we go?
GID00063273	Where exactly are we going?
GID00063274	What do you hope to find?
GID00063275	Can I ask where we're going?
GID00063276	Yep, I'm ready to go.
GID00063277	Okay, I'm ready to go.
GID00063278	Can I ask what you're looking for?
GID00063279	Okay, I'll do that.
GID00063280	Medical supplies are always scarce, and they don't kill the buyer as often. Think of the profits!
GID00063281	But you could turn a profit and help the people of the Mojave!
GID00063282	I'll take the caps.
GID00063283	I'll take the recipe.
GID00063284	But think of all the people who overdose on Jet and Psycho. It's bad for your karma.
GID00063285	If "groodalicious" means "dead," maybe. Think of the children, man! The *children!*
GID00063286	I can teach you to make Super Stimpaks.
GID00063287	I was thinking Super Stimpacks, but now I'm not so sure.
GID00063288	I can teach you to make Hydra.
GID00063289	I was thinking Hydra, but now I'm not so sure.
GID00063290	I can teach you to make Slasher.
GID00063291	I was thinking Slasher, but now I'm not so sure.
GID00063292	I can teach you to make Party-Time Mentats.
GID00063293	I was thinking Party-Time Mentats, but now I'm not so sure.
GID00063294	I can teach you to make Rocket.
GID00063295	I was thinking Rocket, but now I'm not so sure.
GID00063296	On second thought, nothing now.
GID00063297	I'm looking to make a few caps. Got any work for me?
GID00063298	I finished the Crimson Caravan run.
GID00063299	I finished the Vault 3 run.
GID00063300	Any new jobs for me?
GID00063301	Now that Anders is back, how about that work?
GID00063302	Any new jobs for me?
GID00063303	Any new jobs for me?
GID00063304	Any new jobs for me?
GID00063305	You've got an impressive setup here - have you considered making more helpful chems?
GID00063306	How's the medical work going?
GID00063307	Have you started making meds yet?
GID00063308	What do you have for sale?
GID00063309	I know a few recipes for chems you might want. I could teach you.
GID00063311	Sure, just tell me who I'm looking for and where to start.
GID00063312	Sounds like more trouble than it's worth. I'll pass.
GID00063313	Okay, I'll be back as soon as I have any news.
GID00063314	Sure, what have you got?
GID00063315	On second thought, never mind.
GID00063316	Sure, I'll do it.
GID00063317	I'm not interested in being a drug mule.
GID00063318	Piece of cake.
GID00063319	Sounds too dangerous, I'll pass.
GID00063320	I've got a package here from your friends Jack and Diane.
GID00063321	I've got a package here from your friends Jack and Diane.
GID00063322	4 chips for 1 Legion Denarius.
GID00063323	100 chips for 1 Legion Aureus or 25 Legion Denarii.
GID00063324	20 chips for 5 Legion Denarii.
GID00063325	40 chips for 10 Legion Denarii.
GID00063326	80 chips for 20 Legion Denarii.
GID00063327	2 chips for $5 NCR.
GID00063328	8 chips for $20 NCR.
GID00063329	40 chips for $100 NCR.
GID00063330	I'll take my payout in caps.
GID00063331	Pay me in NCR money.
GID00063332	Legion money, please.
GID00063333	Goodbye.
GID00063334	This brain is from Rey, one of Old Lady Gibson's dogs.
GID00063335	I took down a Fiend dog named Violetta.
GID00063336	I got a brain from Lupa, the mother of many Legion Mongrels.
GID00063337	Hold off for now.
GID00063339	<Raise arms>Boogedy boogedy boo!
GID00063340	You mean your army is about to attack?
GID00063341	You're the Legate, I'm guessing?
GID00063342	And what do you want me to do?
GID00063343	What does Lanius mean?
GID00063344	I wanted to know more about you.
GID00063345	Are you looking forward to the battle?
GID00063346	What do you think of the NCR?
GID00063347	Any idea what our chances are?
GID00063348	I'm ready. What is the plan?
GID00063349	What can you tell me about the layout of the dam?
GID00063350	I have questions.
GID00063351	Then let's go.
GID00063352	Time to go pay General Oliver a visit.
GID00063353	You're the problem here.
GID00063354	My dog here doesn't like you.
GID00063355	No problem.
GID00063356	Goodbye.
GID00063357	I found this detonator in your pocket.
GID00063358	Would you happen to know who did maintenance on the President's vertibird?
GID00063359	Just come with me, right now.
GID00063360	My mistake.
GID00063361	Why don't we take this somewhere private?
GID00063362	Maybe I should go get the MPs.
GID00063363	There's a dead ranger downstairs!
GID00063364	I need you to radio in an emergency report!
GID00063365	Let's go!
GID00063366	Is it okay to leave your post?
GID00063367	Let's radio it in first.
GID00063368	<Ambush Dialog>
GID00063369	Okay, but let's make it quick.
GID00063370	No, radio it in first.
GID00063371	Just get out of the way.
GID00063372	< Speech 80 >
GID00063373	< Speech 80 >
GID00063374	What you do in the wasteland affects all the mutants here, but you didn't think about that, did you?
GID00063375	Doctor Henry doesn't have the cure just yet, but he's almost there. Be patient.
GID00063376	What are you planning to do once you have the specs?
GID00063377	The Mark IIs are even more dangerous than standard Stealth Boys.
GID00063378	Doctor Henry, do as he asks.
GID00063379	You're not getting the Mark II specs.
GID00063380	You should just go kill him.
GID00063381	Can I ask you something else?
GID00063382	Can I ask you something else?
GID00063384	What do you know about the Legion?
GID00063385	What makes the NCR too ambitious?
GID00063386	Anything else can you tell me about the NCR?
GID00063387	Do you have any dealings with New Vegas?
GID00063388	Let's talk about something else.
GID00063389	There was no reasonable chance of success.
GID00063390	I changed my mind.
GID00063391	And once I'm inside?
GID00063392	I should be going.
GID00063393	Canine neuroscience?
GID00063394	You were with the Enclave?
GID00063395	I'm all set.
GID00063396	I need to prepare first.
GID00063397	I have some questions.
GID00063398	<Ranger Graham Morning Conversation>
GID00063399	Can I use my weapons during the President's visit?
GID00063400	What are your security arrangements?
GID00063401	Do you have a detailed schedule for the visit?
GID00063402	Do you have any leads on possible security threats?
GID00063403	What can I do to help?
GID00063404	So what's the plan for today?
GID00063405	Let's get this show on the road.
GID00063406	I've made my preparations. Let's get started.
GID00063407	I'm done with questions.
GID00063408	I'm going to need access everywhere.
GID00063409	I have access, right?
GID00063410	Sounds good.
GID00063411	No more questions.
GID00063412	Astor has agreed to let you join him.
GID00063413	<Lie> Oh yeah, I'm sure he'd love to see you.
GID00063414	Can you tell me anything about Camp Searchlight?
GID00063415	What's the history of the camp?
GID00063416	On second thought, let me ask you something else.
GID00063417	You define who you are, not some dog tag.
GID00063418	Your humanity is a part of you, not kept in some dog tag.
GID00063419	Give me your dog tag, now!
GID00063420	He thinks you're suffering.
GID00063421	[Attack] You're a rabid dog that needs to be put down.
GID00063422	Actually, I want to talk about something else.
GID00063423	Before I take care of them, can I ask you about your dog tag?
GID00063424	Can I have it?
GID00063425	There's an NCR soldier who wants me to kill you for it.
GID00063426	Can I ask you something else?
GID00063427	Can I ask you about your dog tag first?
GID00063428	Did he also tell you women aren't permitted to serve in the Legion?
GID00063429	If the Great Khans join the Legion, you'll be sold as a slave. An officer's wife, if you're lucky.
GID00063430	What? Wait, can't we talk about this?
GID00063431	If you think you can take me, then.
GID00063432	Oh good, I've been needing a new head for my trophy spike.
GID00063433	Not really, no. Let's do this.
GID00063434	Not while there are still spines un-shattered.
GID00063435	Caesar isn't going to let you run drugs as an ally any more than he supports it now. He hates chems.
GID00063436	Not yet, but I'll find some.
GID00063437	No, and finding some would be too much work. Never mind.
GID00063438	But you won't have each other. The Legion will kill you and sell Diane into slavery as a prostitute.
GID00063439	Let's get this over with then.
GID00063440	Send your whole damned Legion if you want - I'll water the desert with their blood.
GID00063441	But surely a warrior in service of glorious Caesar is the equal of any tribe's finest?
GID00063442	Wow, you're not worthy to join a scruffy tribe of has-been desert raiders? You must suck.
GID00063443	Because you know they'd come up lacking?
GID00063444	Well-spoken. You win this round.
GID00063445	Interesting opinion, Karl. I wonder what Papa Khan will say about this.
GID00063446	So if you were in charge of the tribe, you'd fight with the NCR against Caesar if asked?
GID00063447	Caesar is only using you, he doesn't actually care about the Great Khans.
GID00063448	Do you really think Caesar is going to restore your tribe to glory? You'll be made slaves.
GID00063449	Because the NCR is the best hope for long-term stability in the region, not Caesar.
GID00063450	That sounds wise. I wish you the best.
GID00063451	Hey, as long as you aren't fighting for Caesar, I don't care what you do.
GID00063452	Now that we've got that out of the way, I don't suppose you'd consider joining the NCR instead?
GID00063453	Just asking. Good luck on your migration.
GID00063454	All right, all right, don't get touchy. Just stick around for a while. I might change your mind.
GID00063455	Who are you?
GID00063456	What is it you had in mind?
GID00063457	Why should I listen to you?
GID00063458	So what do I do?
GID00063459	Aren't you convinced already, if we're having this conversation?
GID00063460	What would convince Jack and Diane to support me?
GID00063461	What about Melissa?
GID00063462	Okay, I'll see what I can do to convince everyone.
GID00063463	I don't think I actually want to do that.
GID00063464	I'll think about it, but I have other questions for now.
GID00063465	How would I do that?
GID00063466	I'll keep that in mind.
GID00063467	I'm not afraid of Karl, and I don't feel like wasting my time on him.
GID00063468	Tell me again what I need to do to convince Papa.
GID00063469	Nothing, never mind.
GID00063472	You're a mutant, too. Wouldn't the Nightkin listen to you?
GID00063473	Um... you're all mutants. You can't make them do what you say?
GID00063474	Any way I can help?
GID00063475	Never mind. I'll be going now.
GID00063476	Sounds like a deal.
GID00063477	No thanks.
GID00063478	<no prob.>
GID00063479	I have some questions.
GID00063480	What is this place?
GID00063481	What is your role here?
GID00063482	Do you see much action against the NCR?
GID00063483	That is all for now.
GID00063484	There may be a battle in the near future at the Hoover Dam, can you offer any assistance?
GID00063485	Are you and your people still ready to help in the upcoming battle at Hoover Dam?
GID00063486	We're all fine here, thank you. How are you?
GID00063487	Is Ignacio dead over there? Did you kill him?
GID00063488	You're with the Legion?
GID00063489	What will you do now?
GID00063490	Why are you still here?
GID00063491	What you doing here?
GID00063492	How are things, now that the battle for Hoover Dam is over?
GID00063493	How did you survive?
GID00063494	How did they get into the camp?
GID00063495	What kind of favor?
GID00063496	What's in it for me?
GID00063497	Sorry, I can't help you right now.
GID00063498	What's so dangerous about this place?
GID00063499	I'm gonna need more than that if you want my help.
GID00063500	Alright, I'll help.
GID00063501	Sorry, I can't help you right now.
GID00063502	Alright, I'll do it.
GID00063503	Sorry, I can't help you right now.
GID00063504	Sure I'll do it.
GID00063505	Why do you want to kill them?
GID00063506	Alright, I'll do it.
GID00063507	Why Novac?
GID00063508	What kind of creatures?
GID00063509	He is a ghoul in Camp Searchlight.
GID00063510	Nevermind, can I ask you something else?
GID00063511	But he isn't feral.
GID00063512	Can I ask you something else?
GID00063513	Maybe Edwards can help you?
GID00063514	He isn't showing any signs of going feral.
GID00063515	Is there somewhere else he can go?
GID00063516	I'll go ask him about it.
GID00063517	Can I ask you something else?
GID00063518	This is the last of the dog tags.
GID00063519	If it's filled with radiation, why are you still here?
GID00063520	Where should I go instead?
GID00063521	Former? What happened?
GID00063522	Can I ask you something else?
GID00063523	Maybe they'll let you back in?
GID00063524	You're right, ghouls aren't fit to be in the army.
GID00063525	[Attack] Don't worry, I'll put you out of your misery.
GID00063526	I see you're wearing an NCR dog tag.
GID00063527	Goodbye.
GID00063528	Can I have your dog tag?
GID00063529	You know, there's an NCR soldier outside who wants me to kill you for it.
GID00063530	Can I ask you something else?
GID00063531	There must be someplace you can go.
GID00063532	Why haven't you gone feral yet?
GID00063533	Actually I have another question.
GID00063534	Can you tell me what happened here?
GID00063535	But ghouls are immune to radiation.
GID00063536	Is that the only thing you're afraid of?
GID00063537	There's still radiation in your house.
GID00063538	Can I ask you about something else then?
GID00063539	Can I ask you something else?
GID00063540	I'm positive, they're all gone.
GID00063541	Well, there may still be a few out there.
GID00063542	<Lie> They are definitely all gone.
GID00063543	Actually lets talk about something else.
GID00063544	I'll take care of them. Be right back.
GID00063545	I want to talk about something else.
GID00063546	There are plenty of places out in the wasteland.
GID00063547	Maybe First Sergeant Astor will let you join him?
GID00063548	You should work things out with First Sergeant Astor.
GID00063549	I heard Ranger Station Echo up north is manned by other ghouls.
GID00063550	Let's talk about something else first.
GID00063551	I'll go talk to him first.
GID00063552	On second thought maybe somewhere else would work better.
GID00063553	There's always the wasteland.
GID00063554	Ranger Station Echo is north of here. They have ghoul troopers.
GID00063555	Lets talk about something else first.
GID00063556	Don't worry, I'll talk to Astor and work it out for you.
GID00063557	It's either him or the wasteland.
GID00063558	Ranger Station Echo up north may take you in.
GID00063560	There was another man involved at Sloan, but he's dead.
GID00063562	Is this delivery legal?
GID00063563	How did you end up joining the Great Khans?
GID00063564	Why the lockdown?
GID00063565	Who's authorized to go upstairs?
GID00063566	I've always wanted to see the President's vertibird.
GID00063567	May I have permission to go on the roof of the Visitor Center?
GID00063568	Pretty please?
GID00063569	Come on!
GID00063570	That's too bad.
GID00063571	Go on.
GID00063572	Uh huh. Make sense. Say more words.
GID00063573	I have another question.
GID00063574	The Brotherhood of Steel knew about ARCHIMEDES?
GID00063575	Why was the Brotherhood of Steel here?
GID00063576	Are there any other survivors?
GID00063577	What happened?
GID00063578	Can I ask you something else?
GID00063579	<Questions>
GID00063580	<Questions>
GID00063581	Can you tell me about your people?
GID00063582	Tell me about Papa Khan.
GID00063583	Regis says I should talk to you about speaking against the Great Khans' alliance with Caesar.
GID00063584	Who are you?
GID00063585	What do you think of the Great Khans?
GID00063586	I've been wondering why you don't petition the Khans for membership as a show of allegiance.
GID00063587	Who did this to you?
GID00063588	What are you doing up there?
GID00063589	You're smuggling drugs?
GID00063590	Let's get you down from there.
GID00063591	Are you Anders? Jack and Diane sent me to look for you.
GID00063592	I think you're better off where you are. Hang around, I'll be back.
GID00063593	Not yet, but I had some questions.
GID00063594	Actually, I have a few questions first.
GID00063595	Good luck on your journey.
GID00063597	I'm sorry, but all these muscles make it hard to hear sometimes. What was that about risk?
GID00063599	Chomps Lewis, the foreman at Sloan, was also involved.
GID00063601	Tyrone has been selling chemical supplies to the Great Khans. Here - I got these from him.
GID00063603	<Lie> No, there wasn't anyone else.
GID00063604	What is this place?
GID00063605	Your supplier was exposed. There won't be any more chemical supplies.
GID00063606	Simple. I turned him in.
GID00063607	He was sloppy and trusted the wrong person.
GID00063608	<Lie> Beats me.
GID00063609	You want me to kill Caesar?
GID00063610	So what do you want me to do at Fortification Hill?
GID00063611	Going to the Fort sounds insane.
GID00063612	Caesar has already invited me to the Fort.
GID00063613	I've already met with Caesar at the Fort.
GID00063614	I think I'll be going.
GID00063615	Crops in Westside - the apparent water shortage here can't be a coincidence, then.
GID00063616	The fields should be getting their full supply of water again.
GID00063617	What can you tell me about the Followers of the Apocalypse?
GID00063618	Followers of who?
GID00063619	What do you know about the Followers of the Apocalypse?
GID00063620	What is this place?
GID00063621	What do you do here?
GID00063622	Who are the Followers of the Apocalypse?
GID00063623	<Press the yellow button to quit.>
GID00063624	Play again.
GID00063625	I'm done.
GID00063627	I feel lucky.
GID00063629	How about you and I come to another arrangement. It'll be worth it - trust me.
GID00063630	I'll make sure the Boomers support the right side.
GID00063631	Where can I find more of these caps?
GID00063632	So you collect these caps too?
GID00063633	Thanks for the info, but I'll be going now.
GID00063634	What kind of treasure are we talking about?
GID00063635	You mentioned someone named Festus. Who's that?
GID00063636	It'll be more fun if we keep it a mystery. Besides, I'm more interested in you.
GID00063637	You too tense. It wrinkle your nice face.
GID00063638	I don't need your help. I'm going to carve myself a key from your bones.
GID00063639	I am pale Death come to bear you to Perdition.
GID00063640	An attractive woman like yourself all alone? Maybe you and I could work out some kind of trade...
GID00063641	Goodbye.
GID00063642	< Barter - 50 >
GID00063643	250 caps. Unless you think you'll find another buyer soon for such specialized parts?
GID00063644	You should cut down the price. It's not like anyone will probably buy them.
GID00063645	< Speech - 50 >
GID00063646	But you're going to cut the price to 250 because I'm just that charming, right?
GID00063647	How about a discount? I'm a nice person.
GID00063648	500 caps it is. Here you go.
GID00063649	Never mind.
GID00063650	250 caps it is. Here you go.
GID00063651	I don't have the caps with me right now.
GID00063652	I'll be back in a bit.
GID00063653	Deal. Here's 700 caps.
GID00063654	< Barter 70 >
GID00063655	I'm offering Rey immortality of a sort. Are you really going to put a price on that?
GID00063656	It's just a dog's brain. I don't think it's worth that many caps.
GID00063657	Never mind.
GID00063658	How did you meet Doctor Henry?
GID00063659	What's the story with Keene?
GID00063660	Why does Keene want to leave?
GID00063661	What happens if Keene leaves?
GID00063662	What do you do in Jacobstown?
GID00063663	What's the next step?
GID00063664	I've done enough work for you.
GID00063665	I've come here to kill you, Mr. House. <Attack Mr. House.>
GID00063666	I'll make sure they support the right side.
GID00063667	I've done enough work for you for the moment.
GID00063668	<Decline quest to neutralize Boomers.>
GID00063669	I'd like to ask some questions.
GID00063670	Tell me about the mission.
GID00063671	If I want more work, I'll come see you.
GID00063672	The Boomers and I had a disagreement a while back. I pretty much wiped them out.
GID00063673	The Boomers have already vowed to help me out.
GID00063674	I'll check into the Omertas.
GID00063675	The Omertas? No thanks.
GID00063676	I'm going to kill you now, Mr. House.
GID00063677	The Omertas were clever, but no match for me.
GID00063678	They had it coming. The Omertas disgust me!
GID00063679	It's a good thing we stopped the Omertas in time.
GID00063680	Where do you want me to start?
GID00063681	Any possibility of a diplomatic solution?
GID00063682	I don't want to kill off the entire Brotherhood.
GID00063683	What do you want me to do?
GID00063684	Let me think about it.
GID00063685	I've already destroyed their bunker.
GID00063686	Goodbye.
GID00063687	Why are these fields being guarded?
GID00063688	What can you tell me about these fields?
GID00063689	Trent Bascom says he's not getting his full allotment of water.
GID00063690	I'm looking for Corporal White. Trent told me you'd seen him.
GID00063691	You haven't heard anything more from White?
GID00063692	Do you have something against White?
GID00063693	Let's talk about something else.
GID00063694	Goodbye.
GID00063695	You work these fields?
GID00063696	What's the Thaler Act?
GID00063697	Why is this work a bum deal?
GID00063698	What are NCR troopers doing here?
GID00063699	What kind of crops do you grow?
GID00063700	Let's talk about something else.
GID00063701	Water was being diverted to Westside, but I took care of the problem.
GID00063702	<Lie> The NCR admitted there's bad pipes somewhere, and took care of the problem.
GID00063703	Me? I have no idea what you're talking about.
GID00063704	What are you going to do now?
GID00063705	Goodbye.
GID00063706	Can't you just grow less crops?
GID00063707	I'm looking for Corporal White. I was told that he'd spoken to you.
GID00063708	He was hurting you?
GID00063709	Goodbye.
GID00063710	Goodbye.
GID00063711	What do you do here?
GID00063712	A friend in Sloan told me to come to you about some chemical supplies.
GID00063713	You were already paid in advance.
GID00063714	< Speech 40 >
GID00063715	I say the word and someone else will start making deliveries to Nevada, not you.
GID00063716	Come on. Give me a break, just this once.
GID00063717	< Barter 35 >
GID00063718	Is 300 caps worth being known as a deal-breaker? Seems like bad business to me.
GID00063719	It's not a fair trade, and you know it.
GID00063720	Here's 300 caps. Hand over those supplies.
GID00063721	Never mind. Let's talk about something else.
GID00063722	About those chemical supplies...
GID00063723	How do you like being part of the NCR military?
GID00063724	You don't care that you're helping the Great Khans?
GID00063725	Has Tyrone cheated you before?
GID00063726	All right. I'll go pay a visit to Tyrone.
GID00063727	How do you know Melissa?
GID00063728	Goodbye.
GID00063729	I'm looking for some Great Khans who stole something from me in Goodsprings.
GID00063730	What are you doing up here?
GID00063731	I'll help you with your problem.
GID00063732	What kind of delivery are you expecting?
GID00063733	Seems like an odd place to pick up a delivery.
GID00063734	No angle. I just want to help.
GID00063735	A favor for a favor.
GID00063736	Well, I am expecting to be paid, of course.
GID00063737	Are these chemicals dangerous?
GID00063738	Got it. Let's talk about something else.
GID00063739	Anything else I should know?
GID00063740	I got the chems for you.
GID00063741	Tell me about the Great Khans.
GID00063742	Let's talk about something else now.
GID00063743	Let's talk about something else.
GID00063744	<Lie> Just trying to get on the good side of the Great Khans.
GID00063745	What happened between the Great Khans and the NCR?
GID00063746	Where can I find the rest of the Great Khans?
GID00063747	Goodbye.
GID00063748	Hmmm... your leg appears to be injured.
GID00063749	How's it going?
GID00063750	< Medicine - 30 >
GID00063751	[Clean the wound with antibiotics and expertly bind Snuffles' injured leg.]
GID00063752	[Do your best attempts at first aid to treat Snuffles' injured leg.]
GID00063753	Surrender, general. The dam is almost taken.
GID00063754	Tell me about the Powder Gangers.
GID00063755	Have you had problems with Deathclaws before?
GID00063756	I could take care of your Deathclaw problem.
GID00063757	Let's talk about something else.
GID00063758	What does the NCR need with the cement?
GID00063759	What's a dragline?
GID00063760	You don't get paid in caps?
GID00063761	Let's talk about something else.
GID00063762	I noticed you have a tame molerat.
GID00063763	People have a rather unique taste, I've discovered.
GID00063764	Why do you ask?
GID00063765	Ghouls and Super Mutants sometimes taste like Brahmin steaks.
GID00063766	Anything that wasn't made 200 years ago.
GID00063767	Where did you come up with this recipe?
GID00063768	Where can I find a Deathclaw egg?
GID00063769	What are you offering in exchange for a Deathclaw egg?
GID00063770	Let's talk about something else.
GID00063771	Goodbye.
GID00063772	About that Deathclaw Omelet recipe...
GID00063773	I had some questions about this place.
GID00063774	Show me what you have for sale.
GID00063775	Let's talk about something else.
GID00063776	You don't look like a quarry worker.
GID00063777	Are you from California?
GID00063778	Any trouble around here?
GID00063779	I just happen to have a Deathclaw egg with me. Here.
GID00063780	I got a Deathclaw egg for you.
GID00063781	Don't mention it. I'll be on my way.
GID00063782	What was that you took from his corpse?
GID00063783	Yes, I've got a few myself.
GID00063784	No, can't say that I have.
GID00063785	Sure have. And I'm thinking of adding yours to my collection.
GID00063786	Nothing like those six you've got there.
GID00063787	Are you sure that necklace is yours?
GID00063788	Actually, the necklace is made of seven caps. It's not really yours, is it?
GID00063789	You stole that cap necklace from that poor man.
GID00063790	Let's just say I'll leave just enough of you left for the dogs to fight over.
GID00063791	Nothing, I guess.
GID00063792	I'm going to see that justice is done.
GID00063793	Kill you, I suppose.
GID00063794	Hand over the necklace, thief.
GID00063795	No reason. Sorry to bother you.
GID00063796	Why were you following me?
GID00063797	Go on.
GID00063798	Don't follow me. You'll live longer.
GID00063799	What's so special about these caps?
GID00063800	Why didn't you say anything then and there?
GID00063801	This is getting creepy. I'm leaving, and don't follow me.
GID00063802	What kind of treasure are we talking about?
GID00063803	So you collect these caps too?
GID00063804	Where can I find more of these caps?
GID00063805	What kind of treasure are we talking about?
GID00063806	Did you know her?
GID00063807	Lucky charm necklace?
GID00063808	I have to be going.
GID00063809	All sorts of nasty people are looking for caps like those. You'd be safer if you got rid of them.
GID00063810	Those caps are bad luck. Why don't you let me hold onto them for you?
GID00063811	Lucky for me, you mean. Hand them over.
GID00063812	Lucky for me, you mean. Hand them over or I gut you like a fish.
GID00063813	I can hold onto them for you. I'm not worried about the people that are looking for them.
GID00063814	Just get rid of them. It doesn't matter how you do it.
GID00063815	Just be more careful in the future, okay?
GID00063816	Figure it out yourself. I need to get out of here.
GID00063817	Of course I have a plan.
GID00063818	I haven't given it much thought.
GID00063819	I don't need a plan to put a bullet in his head.
GID00063820	It's none of your business.
GID00063821	What sort of information do you have?
GID00063822	Let's get moving.
GID00063823	Do you have any suggestions about the assassination?
GID00063824	What sort of intel have you gathered?
GID00063825	How are we getting into the Dam?
GID00063826	Is there anything you can do to help?
GID00063827	I don't have any more questions.
GID00063828	Tell me about Kimball's schedule.
GID00063829	Give me the security details.
GID00063830	Let's go back to my other questions.
GID00063831	I'm familiar with explosives, give it here.
GID00063832	How hard can it be to put a bomb on a vertibird?
GID00063833	No thanks.
GID00063834	I'm familiar with explosives, give it here.
GID00063835	How hard can it be to put a bomb on a vertibird?
GID00063836	I don't need a bomb.
GID00063837	<First Dialog by Watson to Player>
GID00063838	Your helmet is right over there.
GID00063839	What do you know about the President's visit?
GID00063840	Tell me about yourself.
GID00063841	It's right over there.
GID00063842	I haven't seen it.
GID00063843	[Lie] Do you mean the helmet I just threw off the dam?
GID00063845	Fantastic? What are you doing here?
GID00063846	Get this straight. You're not my master.
GID00063847	What are your responsibilities now?
GID00063848	They put you in charge of Hoover Dam?
GID00063849	So you have to do whatever Lawson tells you.
GID00063850	What are you doing here?
GID00063851	Do you have a means of changing her mind? Something I can do?
GID00063852	Will the White Glove Society ally with Caesar now?
GID00063853	I'm still working on it.
GID00063855	You aren't feral are you?
GID00063856	<Questions>
GID00063857	<Questions>
GID00063858	<Questions>
GID00063860	Why are you still here?
GID00063861	The radscorpions are gone.
GID00063862	Sorry, I didn't catch your name.
GID00063863	<Questions>
GID00063864	<Questions>
GID00063865	<Questions>
GID00063866	<Questions>
GID00063867	<Questions>
GID00063868	Are you looking for something?
GID00063869	I found the radiation suits.
GID00063870	I found the location of the radiation suits.
GID00063871	I've been a lot of help to you already. You can do me this one favor.
GID00063873	About Doctor Henry's experiment...
GID00063874	Goodbye.
GID00063875	You're not getting the Mark II specs.
GID00063876	Doctor Henry, do as he asks.
GID00063877	How does that make you different from some humans?
GID00063878	[Stare silently at him.]
GID00063879	Goodbye.
GID00063880	I'm looking into the Nightstalker mutation. Want to come along with me?
GID00063881	What makes you think that the Nightstalker mutation isn't natural?
GID00063882	Go ahead and start the tests.
GID00063883	Don't start just yet. I'll be back.
GID00063884	You should stay with your family - reconcile with them.
GID00063885	You should get out of here and never come back.
GID00063886	[Attack] Thanks for the gun, it will make this easier.
GID00063887	You should leave and never come back.
GID00063888	You should leave and never come back.
GID00063889	[Attack] I'm not seeing it either, yet!
GID00063890	<Attack> I'm not seeing it either, yet!
GID00063891	Only you can answer that.
GID00063892	I... guess that's your choice.
GID00063893	You should leave and never come back.
GID00063894	<Attack> Here's my answer.
GID00063895	Give them a chance.
GID00063896	You should stay with your family - reconcile with them.
GID00063897	You should get out of here and never come back.
GID00063898	<Attack> You're not going anywhere.
GID00063899	Alice, Andy's just using you to get the money.
GID00063900	So, where's the money?
GID00063901	<Attack> That won't do. Time to put you down.
GID00063902	Okay, go ahead. I'll wait for you.
GID00063903	Calm down. I just want to talk.
GID00063904	I give up. Sort it out on your own.
GID00063905	Now there really is no turning back.
GID00063906	That was great! Good job, Alice.
GID00063907	[Attack] You're next!
GID00063908	Once I have my share, you can get out of here.
GID00063909	Grab the money and run far away.
GID00063910	[Attack] I think you're better dead.
GID00063911	I don't care about any of this.
GID00063912	Nice to meet you too.
GID00063913	Let's get on with this.
GID00063914	I've made my preparations. Let's get started.
GID00063915	Yes, I'm ready.
GID00063916	I'm not ready yet.
GID00063924	I had some questions about Jacobstown.
GID00063925	What's the history of Jacobstown?
GID00063926	I'd like to know about you.
GID00063927	Super Mutant army?
GID00063928	You were a mayor?
GID00063929	Tell me more about the tribal.
GID00063930	Let's talk about something else.
GID00063931	No more questions. Let's talk about something else.
GID00063932	How does the town support itself?
GID00063933	Nobody who threatens me lives to tell about it. Not even Nightkin.
GID00063934	What are you talking about?
GID00063935	I heard your radio broadcast. I'm here to help.
GID00063936	This is it, buddy.
GID00063937	You think I need more men to get the job done?
GID00063938	What killed the other troopers?
GID00063939	Are you okay?
GID00063940	How did you kill that thing?
GID00063941	Looks like some nasty lacerations and a dislocated joint. You're lucky I found you.
GID00063942	I think I've got a dull needle and twine in one of my pockets.
GID00063943	<Use Doctor Bag to heal his leg> This should help fix up your leg.
GID00063944	I'll be back.
GID00063945	That's a nice gun you've got there.
GID00063946	You're free to leave. The way up is clear.
GID00063947	We need to clear the caves first.
GID00063948	You're free to leave. The way up is clear.
GID00063949	If we don't clear the caves, your friends' deaths were for nothing. Can you live with that?
GID00063950	More people are going to die if we don't do something.
GID00063951	Let's get moving.
GID00063952	Have a safe trip.
GID00063953	This brain is from Rey, one of Old Lady Gibson's dogs.
GID00063954	Transplant Rey's brain into Rex.
GID00063955	I got a brain from Lupa, the mother of many Legion Mongrels.
GID00063956	Transplant Lupa's brain into Rex.
GID00063957	Hold off on the transplant.
GID00063958	Never mind. I want to hold off for now.
GID00063959	I took down a Fiend dog named Violetta.
GID00063960	Transplant Violetta's brain into Rex.
GID00063961	Companions.
GID00063962	Rex.
GID00063963	Never mind.
GID00063964	Spawn him and add him as a companion.
GID00063965	Never mind.
GID00063966	Start the quest to fix Rex's brain.
GID00063967	I hear you've been causing trouble.
GID00063968	[Attack] I'm looking at my next victim.
GID00063969	Goodbye.
GID00063970	No need for violence. What'll it take for you to stop?
GID00063971	These people won't put up with you forever.
GID00063972	Locals are getting edgy. How long, you think, before you're gutted open by an angry mob?
GID00063973	[Attack] I was hoping you'd be that stupid.
GID00063974	No need for violence. What'll it take for you to stop?
GID00063975	[Attack] I'm going to enjoy seeing you bleed.
GID00063976	How about if I pay you 100 caps to get out of here?
GID00063977	You can't really enjoy living here. Take 50 caps and get out of here.
GID00063978	Goodbye.
GID00063979	These people will not put up with you forever.
GID00063980	Goodbye.
GID00063981	No need for violence. What'll it take for you to stop?
GID00063982	Goodbye.
GID00063983	[Attack] Can't say I didn't try. Time to die!
GID00063984	I'm not here to hurt you.
GID00063985	What's going on here?
GID00063986	<Attack> Time to put you down!
GID00063987	I'm here to help you. Andy sent me.
GID00063988	I just want to talk, that's all.
GID00063989	I'm here to help you. Andy sent me.
GID00063990	What's going on in here?
GID00063991	<Attack> Time to put you down!
GID00063992	I hear you, and I'm not going to hurt you.
GID00063993	I'm here to help you. Andy sent me.
GID00063994	<Attack> Time to put you down!
GID00063995	Alice, Andy's just using you to get the money.
GID00063996	Do you have the money?
GID00063997	So, where's the money?
GID00063998	What's going on here?
GID00063999	<Attack> I'll take over now, without you.
GID00064000	No, look at this note I found in his room.
GID00064001	What do you really want, Alice?
GID00064002	Why are you doing this? Just for the money?
GID00064003	They care for you, in their own way.
GID00064004	Do you have the money?
GID00064005	What's going on here?
GID00064006	<Attack> I'll help you leave, dead cold.
GID00064007	Never mind, Andy sent me to help you, actually.
GID00064008	Okay, go ahead. I'll wait for you.
GID00064009	Alice, Andy's just using you to get the money.
GID00064010	I'm here to help you. Andy sent me.
GID00064011	Talk you out of what?
GID00064012	<Attack> You're right, there's no turning back. Time to teach you a lesson.
GID00064013	I don't care about this. Sort it out yourselves.
GID00064014	Okay, go ahead. I'll wait for you.
GID00064015	They care for you, in their own way.
GID00064016	Alice, Andy's just using you to get the money.
GID00064017	I'm here to help you. Andy sent me.
GID00064018	What's going on in here?
GID00064019	<Attack> I think I'll just put you down.
GID00064020	Do you have the money?
GID00064021	What's going on in here?
GID00064022	[Attack] That won't do. Time to put you down.
GID00064023	Alice, Andy's just using you to get the money.
GID00064024	I know, but look at this note I've found in Andy's room.
GID00064025	Do you have the money?
GID00064026	Do you have the money?
GID00064027	Alice, Andy's just using you to get the money.
GID00064028	I'm here to help you. Andy sent me.
GID00064029	Don't worry. Just get the cash. I'll wait for you.
GID00064030	Look at this note I found in Andy's room.
GID00064031	Is that what you really want?
GID00064032	<Attack> No, you won't.
GID00064033	I don't care about this. Sort it out yourselves.
GID00064034	I don't care about this. Sort it out yourselves.
GID00064035	Forget it. Sort your problems by yourselves.
GID00064036	Forget it. Sort your problems by yourselves.
GID00064037	Actually, just sort this out on your own.
GID00064038	I'm not interested in this. Sort it out yourselves.
GID00064039	<Attack> You are no help, time to put you down.
GID00064040	Give me your gun, Alice.
GID00064041	I should've known you don't have what it takes.
GID00064042	<Attack> I'll make you do it.
GID00064043	Relax, I was just leaving.
GID00064044	I know about your plans for Alice.
GID00064045	<Attack> I'm here to kill you.
GID00064046	Goodbye.
GID00064047	<Lie> I've no idea what you're talking about.
GID00064048	Yes, I did. I know about your plans for Alice.
GID00064049	<Attack> Yes, but I figured I'd save her the trouble of killing you.
GID00064050	Goodbye.
GID00064051	Why would she be?
GID00064052	<Attack> She won't be, once I'm done with you.
GID00064053	Goodbye.
GID00064054	I was just exploring North Vegas and found this building.
GID00064055	I went into your room. I know about your plans for Alice.
GID00064056	<Attack> And it's the last you'll ever see.
GID00064057	Nothing, goodbye.
GID00064058	She deserves to know the truth.
GID00064059	You're manipulating her into betraying her family.
GID00064060	Goodbye.
GID00064061	Aren't you afraid I'll blow your plans?
GID00064062	<Attack> Sure, but first, let's tie up loose ends.
GID00064063	Goodbye.
GID00064064	A cut from the Hostetlers' money, and I might help you.
GID00064065	Maybe I'll do that, then. Goodbye.
GID00064066	Actually, I know about your plans for Alice.
GID00064067	<Attack> Only after I've taken care of you.
GID00064068	Goodbye.
GID00064069	I know about your plans for Alice.
GID00064070	<Attack> I'm looking for you. It's time to die.
GID00064071	Goodbye.
GID00064072	Relax, I was just leaving.
GID00064073	I know about your plans for Alice.
GID00064074	[Attack] Time to pay.
GID00064075	<Attack> Like this: You're dead.
GID00064076	We'll see. Goodbye.
GID00064077	Goodbye.
GID00064078	Why would Alice follow your plans?
GID00064079	Alice should know the truth.
GID00064080	Alice should stay with her family.
GID00064081	I'll help you out for a cut of the Hostetlers' money.
GID00064082	Goodbye.
GID00064083	I'm just another Wasteland wanderer. Why the suspicion?
GID00064084	Relax, I only want to ask you some questions.
GID00064085	Goodbye.
GID00064086	I'm just another Wasteland wanderer. Why the suspicion?
GID00064087	<Attack> I guess you'll have to find out the hard way.
GID00064088	Goodbye.
GID00064089	You look capable of defending yourself.
GID00064090	I see you can take care of yourself. Your revolver's trigger shines like silver.
GID00064091	Can I ask you some questions?
GID00064092	Goodbye.
GID00064093	<Questions General>
GID00064094	Can I ask you other questions?
GID00064095	Goodbye.
GID00064096	Another time. Let me ask you some questions.
GID00064097	Goodbye.
GID00064098	Tell me about North Vegas.
GID00064099	What's your story?
GID00064100	I'm looking for Alice Hostetler.
GID00064101	Goodbye.
GID00064102	NCR whores?
GID00064103	What's your opinion of the NCR, again?
GID00064104	What's the deal with the Fiends?
GID00064105	What did you say before about the Fiends?
GID00064106	Any more trouble with the Fiends?
GID00064107	Do you know where might I find them?
GID00064108	Tell me again where to find Alice and Andy.
GID00064109	What's your opinion of the NCR?
GID00064110	Tell me about North Vegas.
GID00064111	What's the deal with the Fiends?
GID00064112	What did you say before about the Fiends?

GID00064242	I think I know what you meant before.
GID00064243	What do you mean by "more than just a weapon?"

GID00064269	Not anymore?
GID00064270	I have another question about you.

GID00064282	Does Stealth Boy use hurt humans?
GID00064283	Why are you helping the Nightkin?
GID00064284	I'd like to help. What do you need me to do?
GID00064285	Let's talk about something else.
GID00064286	<Speech - Confront>
GID00064287	Your family doesn't want you around. You need to clean up, Frank.
GID00064288	They hate you. Get over it.
GID00064289	They hate you. Get over it.
GID00064290	<Be mean>
GID00064291	Why would I tell an abusive bastard like you?
GID00064292	<Barter>
GID00064293	Show me some caps and I'll tell you exactly where to go.
GID00064294	Hey thanks, Frank. Go to hell.
GID00064295	<Speech - Anger>
GID00064296	You're a slimy yellow-bellied bastard. You don't deserve a family!
GID00064297	Your family doesn't want you around. You need to clean up your act.
GID00064298	They mentioned going to the Old Mormon Fort in Freeside.
GID00064299	Goodbye, Frank.
GID00064300	<Speech - Suicide>
GID00064301	Think about it, Frank. What do you have to live for?
GID00064302	You're scum, Frank. A real bottom-feeder.
GID00064303	So, are you a cannibal?
GID00064304	I don't have any more questions. Let's talk about something else.
GID00064305	You live out here by yourself?
GID00064306	Are you all right?
GID00064307	You were lucky. I might not be around next time.
GID00064308	Why were the Omertas out to kill you?
GID00064309	Goodbye.
GID00064310	Save your thanks - this was a job, nothing more.
GID00064311	You work with the NCR? It was the Legion who sent me to protect you.
GID00064312	So, you're a spy.
GID00064313	Dangerous work.
GID00064314	Let's talk about something else now.
GID00064315	What do you do around here?
GID00064316	Who are you?
GID00064317	What do you know about the Legion?

GID00064319	About your family...
GID00064320	What happened to your family?
GID00064321	Remind me what happened to your family.
GID00064322	I'm infiltrating the organization. I have to gain their trust.
GID00064323	I'm... uh... helping them so I can spy on them better.
GID00064324	It won't happen again.
GID00064325	Things have changed. I'm with Caesar now.
GID00064326	[Attack] I won't be needing your services any longer.
GID00064327	Very well. You have my word.
GID00064328	Sorry. I won't compromise my mission.
GID00064329	Then we can't work together anymore.
GID00064330	All right. I won't do anything else to hurt the NCR.

GID00064518	Does the Legion see much action here?
GID00064519	That's some armor you're wearing.
GID00064520	An NCR officer asked me to plant this listening device here. <Give Aurelius the NCR bug>
GID00064521	Goodbye.
GID00064522	You must be the one in charge here.
GID00064523	I have dog tags to turn in.
GID00064524	It doesn't bother you, enslaving people?
GID00064525	How much would it cost to buy the three "captures"?
GID00064526	Let me think about it.
GID00064527	I'll give you 150 caps for the lot.
GID00064528	How did the Legion set up a camp on this side of the river?
GID00064529	How did you join Caesar's Legion?
GID00064530	Goodbye.
GID00064531	Who is Cursor Lucullus?
GID00064532	Do you have any "captures" with the last name, "Weathers?"
GID00064533	Goodbye.
GID00064534	I've paid for your freedom. You're free to go.
GID00064535	Goodbye.
GID00064536	<Speech>
GID00064537	I'm just a humble trader passing through.
GID00064538	Just thought I'd check the place out.
GID00064539	<Show Mark of Caesar> I was invited.
GID00064540	<Attack> I go where I please!
GID00064541	Be calm. I am a friend of the Legion.
GID00064542	Goodbye.
GID00064543	Who are you calling "Dissolute?"
GID00064544	What have I done to earn this honor?
GID00064545	Goodbye.
GID00064546	Why are you surprised to see a woman receive this honor?
GID00064547	I'm ready to return to Cottonwood Cove.
GID00064548	<Give Mrs. Weathers the key from Canyon Runner>
GID00064549	I'll see what I can do.
GID00064550	<Lie> I paid for your release. You're free to go.
GID00064551	I took care of your master. You're free as a bird.
GID00064552	Goodbye.
GID00064553	How were you captured?
GID00064554	I've paid for your freedom. You're free to go.
GID00064555	Goodbye.
GID00064556	It was an accident.
GID00064557	Just letting you know.
GID00064558	Goodbye.
GID00064559	I can teach you to make Powder Charges.
GID00064560	One.
GID00064561	Three.
GID00064562	Five.
GID00064563	Ten.
GID00064564	I want to trade for something else.
GID00064565	That's it for now.
GID00064566	Study this as long as you need. <Show him the Powder Charge schematic.>
GID00064567	I can show you how to disarm the NCR's mines.
GID00064568	<Player teaches Severus how to disarm NCR munitions>
GID00064569	The trick is to rush the mine and press the blinking red light.
GID00064570	The trick, I figure, is to pick up the mine really, really carefully.
GID00064571	Another time, perhaps.
GID00064572	I have dog tags to turn in.
GID00064573	Your Centurion said I could trade dog tags for supplies.
GID00064574	I need you to stop the violence against NCR citizens in Freeside.
GID00064575	I need some snipers to cover my advance.
GID00064576	Have your unit follow with me, we'll assault them head on.
GID00064577	<Speech Options>
GID00064578	You have superior firepower. You can overwhelm them if you push the advance on them.
GID00064579	You go first. I'll be right behind you.
GID00064580	I can manage this without your assistance.
GID00064581	[Reputation] I've done a lot for the Legion. Just hand over the bear already.
GID00064582	Is that a yes?
GID00064583	They have cyber-dogs in Denver?
GID00064584	I'm ready to fight Lupa now.
GID00064585	I'll be back when I'm ready.
GID00064586	I'm sure. Let's go.
GID00064587	Actually, I still need to prepare some more.
GID00064588	I found an assassin in the tower.
GID00064589	I'm all set. When does the President arrive?
GID00064590	Anything you can help me with?
GID00064591	<Cato Good Morning Dialog>
GID00064592	Nice looking dog you have there.
GID00064593	Notice anything suspicious?
GID00064594	I found a Legion sniper on the roof of the tower.
GID00064595	Nothing to report.
GID00064596	Warning 1
GID00064597	Warning 2
GID00064599	Report, centurion. What are your standing orders?
GID00064600	What news of the battle below?
GID00064601	I have to keep moving. Kill a few of them for me.
GID00064602	It is imperative we secure the dam top. Instead of dividing your men, focus their attack here.
GID00064603	Screw that. I need all your men dying fo- er, backing me up here.
GID00064604	The power plant is what really matters. Have all of your men attack there. I'll finish things here.
GID00064605	Pffft. I can handle things here. You and your men can hold the power plant until I get there.
GID00064606	Why are there so many Great Khan tags around the camp?
GID00064607	I see. Well, that's too bad. Good luck.
GID00064608	I don't need any reward, just keep these people fed and healthy.
GID00064609	Whatever you can spare would be a big help.
GID00064610	I dragged myself all over Hell's half-acre for you, I expect something substantial!
GID00064611	I've got other questions.
GID00064612	It was a Great Khan named Oscar Velasco. His family was killed by the NCR, and he wanted revenge.
GID00064613	It was a Great Khan raider. He had a base camp in a cave up in the mountains.
GID00064614	You mean the massacre three years ago?
GID00064615	What incident?
GID00064616	Like what? It looks to me like the NCR ran the Khans out of Bitter Springs altogether.
GID00064617	Well, it's taken care of now. I convinced him to leave Bitter Springs alone.
GID00064618	Well, it's taken care of now. He's dead.
GID00064619	That's very noble of you. I'd like to talk about something else though.
GID00064620	Any idea why a Great Khan would be so far from Red Rock Canyon?
GID00064621	<Truth> I give you my word I won't tell the NCR where you are. I want to resolve this peacefully.
GID00064622	<Lie> I give you my word I won't tell the NCR where you are. I want to resolve this peacefully.
GID00064623	Don't sweat it, I was glad to help.
GID00064624	Well, if you've got a surplus, maybe you could spare a little medicine?
GID00064625	Some spare meds would be great - and those books weren't cheap.
GID00064626	Thanks, that should cover my expenses.
GID00064627	Those books were pretty expensive. Maybe you can cough up a little more?
GID00064628	<GENERAL QUESTIONS>
GID00064629	<GENERAL QUESTIONS>
GID00064630	How can I serve the Legion?
GID00064631	Your "civilization" sounds like a pack of snarling dogs.
GID00064632	What exactly happened here?
GID00064633	You captured everyone?
GID00064634	Sounds like they got what was coming to them.
GID00064635	I admire the purity of the Legion's justice.
GID00064636	You slaughtered innocent civilians?
GID00064637	I've heard enough.
GID00064638	Who is this Legatus you mention?
GID00064639	Tell me about Caesar.
GID00064640	What happened to the mayor?
GID00064641	How'd your plan go wrong?
GID00064642	Let's talk about something else.
GID00064643	What happened after everyone got lottery tickets?
GID00064644	You said some of the people were enslaved?
GID00064645	I'll do what I can to save them.
GID00064646	It's not my problem.
GID00064647	I can spare some Med-X.
GID00064648	One dose.
GID00064649	Two doses.
GID00064650	Three doses.
GID00064651	Five doses.
GID00064652	I don't have any Med-X for you.
GID00064653	Are you a Powder Ganger?
GID00064656	I'm going to do this my way. I can't bring you.
GID00064657	All right, come along.
GID00064659	Okay, I'll see what I can do.
GID00064660	Legion's attacked Nipton, burned and killed everyone.
GID00064661	<Attack> Ave Caesar!
GID00064662	What outfit did you serve in the military with?
GID00064663	How did you happen to join First Recon?
GID00064664	What's the slogan?
GID00064665	Is that a First Recon beret?
GID00064666	Tell me about Camp McCarran.
GID00064667	What was Camp Golf like?
GID00064668	What do you think of General Oliver?
GID00064669	Do you know Colonel Hsu at all?
GID00064670	The Dam?
GID00064671	Don't worry, I'm not going in there right now.
GID00064672	As long as you don't mind me joining the fun.
GID00064673	I don't want any trouble. We should part ways for now.
GID00064674	Yes, but you're not coming with me.
GID00064675	No, I'm not going in right now.
GID00064676	I'm ready. Caesar won't know what hit him.
GID00064677	No, that's not a problem. That's a solution.
GID00064678	I'm not ready to attack it. We'll keep our distance.
GID00064679	That's not how I want to approach this. You'd better go your own way for now.
GID00064680	Goodbye.
GID00064682	What was your tour with the NCR like?
GID00064683	So why'd you leave?
GID00064684	What did happen at Bitter Springs?
GID00064685	Let's talk about something else.
GID00064686	How do I reach Fortification Hill?
GID00064687	Trust me, your troubles are over. <Set off the explosive in her collar>
GID00064688	I'd like to talk about something else.
GID00064689	I'm looking for a howitzer firing mechanism.
GID00064690	< Barter 50 >
GID00064691	Potentially losing four dogs is a very high price to pay for a toy. What about two?
GID00064692	Can't we make some kind of deal?
GID00064693	I'm ready now. Let's go.
GID00064694	There are a lot of tents here.
GID00064695	Moo! That's what Brahmin say.
GID00064696	I found a bomb on the President's vertibird.
GID00064697	I found a detonator on that man over there.
GID00064698	<Starting Converstation for VMQ03a>
GID00064699	I'm ready. When will the President be here?
GID00064700	So you've been hiding in these mountains ever since? Why?
GID00064701	The people at this camp aren't responsible for your family's death. They're refugees.
GID00064702	But the NCR are trying to help! They're good people, fighting for civilization in a lawless waste!
GID00064703	The Khans settled in Red Rock Canyon years ago. It's time to let go of your hate and join them.
GID00064704	Take revenge on the people actually responsible: Go attack Camp McCarran.
GID00064705	I promised Captain Gilles I'd stop the attacks on Bitter Springs.
GID00064706	Let's not be hasty. I'll be back.
GID00064707	If you insist. Let's finish this.
GID00064708	I understand. I'll leave you to your grief, then.
GID00064709	Let me ask you about something else.
GID00064710	Goodbye.
GID00064711	At least, tell me how you find these creatures.
GID00064712	Let me ask you about something else.
GID00064713	How could I help The Thorn?
GID00064714	Where can I find Giant Mantis' eggs?
GID00064715	Let's talk about the creature's eggs you need.
GID00064716	I'll find Giant Mantis' eggs for you.
GID00064717	Maybe later. Let's go back to my questions.
GID00064718	Goodbye.
GID00064719	How do you find these creatures?
GID00064720	Let's go back to my other questions.
GID00064721	Let's go back to my other questions.
GID00064722	Let's go back to my other questions.
GID00064723	I'm still looking for the Giant Mantis Eggs.
GID00064724	Who else can bring you so many intact eggs? I deserve a bigger reward.
GID00064725	I don't agree with it because... because it was very dangerous and I deserve more caps.
GID00064726	<Questions about VMS38 quest>
GID00064727	Let's talk about the creature's eggs that you need.
GID00064728	200 caps are sufficient. Take the eggs.
GID00064729	I don't need anything in return. Take the eggs.
GID00064730	Goodbye.
GID00064731	Where can I find Radscorpion eggs?
GID00064732	Let's go back to my other questions.
GID00064733	Goodbye.
GID00064734	I'll find the Radscorpion eggs for you.
GID00064735	Maybe later, let's go back to my other questions.
GID00064736	Goodbye.
GID00064737	Is there anything else I can do to help The Thorn?
GID00064738	I've got other questions for you.
GID00064739	Perhaps, I'll keep the eggs for now.
GID00064740	Goodbye.
GID00064741	I was planing on helping you get even deadlier creatures, but not without a raise.
GID00064742	I'm risking my life for you at every turn. Pay up or find another hunter.
GID00064743	300 caps are enough. Take the eggs.
GID00064744	I don't need anything in return. Take the eggs.
GID00064745	Is there anything else I can do to help The Thorn?
GID00064746	I've got other questions for you.
GID00064747	Goodbye.
GID00064748	Where can I find Fire Gecko eggs?
GID00064749	I'll find the Fire Gecko eggs for you.
GID00064750	I'm still looking for the Radscorpion Eggs.
GID00064751	I've shown you my worth. Doesn't your best hunter deserve the best rewards?
GID00064752	Those Fire Geckos are not easy... not easy at all. I deserve more caps.
GID00064753	Is there anything else I can do to help The Thorn?
GID00064754	I've got other questions for you.
GID00064755	Goodbye.
GID00064756	Where can I find Night Stalker Eggs?
GID00064757	I'll find the Night Stalker Eggs for you.
GID00064758	500 caps sound good. Take the eggs.
GID00064759	I don't need anything in return. Take the eggs.
GID00064760	I'm still looking for the Fire Gecko eggs.
GID00064762	I've braved packs of Night Stalkers to get these eggs. My reward should match this effort.
GID00064763	Is there anything else I can do to help The Thorn?
GID00064764	I've got other questions for you.
GID00064765	Goodbye.
GID00064766	I'm getting tired of running around all over The Wasteland for a handful of caps. I want more.
GID00064767	700 caps will do. Take the eggs.
GID00064768	I don't need anything in return. Take the eggs.
GID00064769	Where can I find Cazador Eggs?
GID00064770	I'll find the Cazador Eggs for you.
GID00064771	I've brought the Cazador Eggs.
GID00064772	There's almost nothing worse than Cazadores in The Wasteland. Great deeds deserve great rewards.
GID00064773	Those Cazadores almost killed me. Pay me more or... just pay me more, alright?
GID00064774	Is there anything else I can do to help The Thorn?
GID00064775	I've got other questions for you.
GID00064776	Goodbye.
GID00064777	A 1000 caps will do. Take the eggs.
GID00064778	I don't need anything in return. Take the eggs.
GID00064779	Where can I find Deathclaw Eggs?
GID00064780	I'll find this great prize for you.
GID00064781	Is there anything else I can do to help The Thorn?
GID00064782	I've got other questions for you.
GID00064783	Goodbye.
GID00064784	I will, Lucy.
GID00064785	I'm still looking for the Night Stalker Eggs.
GID00064786	I'm still looking for the Cazador Eggs.
GID00064787	I'm still looking for the Deathclaw Eggs.
GID00064788	I took care of that slave caravan.
GID00064789	I just wandered in here.
GID00064790	I'm here about the hostages.
GID00064791	Can you let them go?
GID00064792	I'll be going now.
GID00064793	I want one of their heads.
GID00064794	Are you the one who's been raiding the refugee camp at Bitter Springs?
GID00064795	It's time to die.
GID00064796	Spare me your sob story, it's time to die.
GID00064797	What happened to your people?
GID00064798	You'll get your freedom if you kill me in single combat. Just you, me, and machetes.
GID00064799	I've decided to let the Legion crucify you.
GID00064800	Goodbye.
GID00064802	Why aren't you sure?
GID00064803	You underestimated us.
GID00064804	You can't take back what you've done. But your regrets can set you on a better path.
GID00064805	I wasn't going to let you die.
GID00064806	Maybe it's just not your time yet.
GID00064807	No one is judging or punishing you. Things just happen.
GID00064808	Having to live with what you've done is your punishment.
GID00064809	Get over it. It's war. People die. Why should it matter whether they're soldiers or civilians?
GID00064812	Who's in charge here?
GID00064813	So what's next for you?
GID00064814	You ever spend time with a trooper named White?
GID00064815	He's gone missing, and I'm trying to track him down. Any ideas?
GID00064816	Did he ever tell you anything about what he was up to?
GID00064817	I'm asking the questions here. Tell me what you know.
GID00064818	Goodbye.
GID00064819	How much for a good time?
GID00064820	Let's party. Here's the hundred caps.
GID00064821	Where are you from?
GID00064822	Never mind.
GID00064823	Uhh... twenty, twenty five... yeah, I have enough. Here you go.
GID00064824	How about we just split this Med-X and... relax for a while?
GID00064825	< Medicine 35 >
GID00064826	I know the right dose for a little thing like you. Medical training, you know.
GID00064827	I used, like, a whole bunch of this stuff and I'm still fine.
GID00064828	< Speech 35 >
GID00064829	I wouldn't offer if it wasn't safe. Do I look like someone who would hurt you?
GID00064830	Mess you up? Nah, it's probably fine. Trust me.
GID00064831	We girls have to stick together. Any chance you could give me a better deal?
GID00064832	Fifty caps it is. Let's party.
GID00064833	A hundred caps? I think you're the one getting the deal here.
GID00064834	I'm a little short on caps.
GID00064835	Uh... sorry. I don't count so good.
GID00064836	< Blink. >
GID00064837	Haha. You're dumber than me.
GID00064838	I don't have a hundred caps on me.
GID00064839	What are we waiting for?
GID00064840	We can stay on Coyote Tail Ridge for the night.
GID00064842	What happened?
GID00064843	I'm not interested in your stories.
GID00064844	You did what you were supposed to as a soldier.
GID00064845	That's not what I would've done at all.
GID00064846	How could you kill innocent people like that?
GID00064847	Let's get out of here. Let them have Bitter Springs.
GID00064848	Your only mistake was not bringing enough ammo.
GID00064849	We can do that.
GID00064850	I'd prefer not to right now.
GID00064851	Why would they come to Bitter Springs?
GID00064852	Good. Saves us the trouble of finding them.
GID00064853	You don't sound surprised.
GID00064854	Can you tell me about Westside?
GID00064855	Do you have a lot of run-ins with the Fiends?
GID00064856	Tell me about the Scorpions.
GID00064857	What's so great about the co-op?
GID00064858	Do you know anything about that Super mutant walking around town?
GID00064859	What do you do around here?
GID00064860	I don't have any more questions. Let's talk about something else.
GID00064861	Enough about the Westside.
GID00064862	How did he end up here on the Westside?
GID00064863	People around here aren't afraid of him?
GID00064864	Do you know how he got away from the NCR?
GID00064865	I'd like to talk about something else now.
GID00064866	Goodbye.
GID00064867	You need to answer for your crime.
GID00064868	You have a deal.
GID00064869	No, I'm not going to lie for you.
GID00064870	Say I keep Westside's secret - what's in it for me?
GID00064871	Ten percent it is.
GID00064872	I'd rather not turn you in, but someone else might come looking for White.
GID00064873	Consider it done. You stay free and Westside keeps getting water.
GID00064874	Forget I said anything. I'll keep your secret, but I'm turning you in.
GID00064875	I'm taking you out, Anderson.
GID00064876	< Barter - 50 >
GID00064877	Westside's secret is easily worth more, but I'm willing to settle for twenty percent.
GID00064878	I'm keeping a very big secret. Twenty percent is fair.
GID00064879	How about twenty percent? Twenty is better.
GID00064880	I could say that... if the price was right.
GID00064881	Keep your money. I'll just say that White was killed by the Scorpions.
GID00064882	It'll be simpler to just kill you.
GID00064883	Then I'm going to kill you.
GID00064884	If I don't turn you in, will you stop stealing NCR water?
GID00064885	Then I'll turn you in, and the water gets shut off.
GID00064886	What bargain will you accept?
GID00064887	I won't turn you in, but what happens when someone else comes looking for White?
GID00064888	<Give NCR bug> NCR wants intel on Cottonwood Cove.
GID00064889	By "captures," do you mean "slaves"?
GID00064890	<SPEECH - player tells CR the daughter has an incurable STD>
GID00064891	<Lie> Any fool can see that girl has all the symptoms of Pustular Hypomyalgia!
GID00064892	But the girl is sick. With classic symptoms of, uh... Vagina Dentata?
GID00064893	I can pay you 300 caps.
GID00064894	I'll give you 150 caps for the lot.
GID00064895	I'll come back if I want to buy them.
GID00064896	Relax, this'll be over quickly. <Set off the explosive in his collar>
GID00064897	Let me deactivate your collar.
GID00064898	Hold still. <Deactivate the charge and remove his collar>
GID00064899	RF detonator? Give me a second.<Deactivate the charge and remove his collar>
GID00064900	Hold still! <Deactivate the charge and remove his collar>
GID00064901	Never mind. I'll see if there is another way to free you.
GID00064902	I'm working on it.
GID00064903	Frank sent me to free you.
GID00064904	I've paid for the three of you. You are free to go.
GID00064905	<SPEECH - Player tells her to make a run for it>
GID00064906	Cry freedom! Run for it!
GID00064907	Run for it!
GID00064908	If you believe hard enough, you can do anything! Run!
GID00064909	Let me deactivate your collar.
GID00064910	Hold still. <Deactivate the charge and remove her collar>
GID00064911	Looks tougher than I thought. We'll have to find another solution.
GID00064912	Don't worry your little head, Sammy. <Set off the explosive in her collar>
GID00064913	Let me deactivate your collar.
GID00064914	I'm working on it.
GID00064915	Hold still. <Deactivate the charge and remove her collar>
GID00064916	Never mind. I'll see if there is another way to free you.

GID00064932	I've spoken to the Great Khans. Their new leader has agreed to fight for the NCR.
GID00064933	Not yet. I'm still working on it.
GID00064934	Yes, ma'am.
GID00064935	I'm a little busy at the moment.
GID00064936	You could say we've had dealings.
GID00064937	I have a score to settle with them.
GID00064938	I might have heard of them. Remind me.
GID00064939	What if I find they're committed to joining Caesar?
GID00064940	Will I have any NCR support in this?
GID00064941	No questions, ma'am.
GID00064942	No further questions, ma'am.
GID00064943	No ma'am.
GID00064944	The Khans won't be a problem to anyone ever again.
GID00064945	Where should I start?
GID00064946	Can you give me any leads?
GID00064947	The Omertas were up to something big, but I stopped them.
GID00064948	I'm still working on it.
GID00064949	<Lie> The Omertas are planning to attack New Reno. It's none of NCR's concern.
GID00064950	<Lie> You've got nothing to worry about. The Omertas are perfectly clean.
GID00064951	I was hoping to ask you some questions.
GID00064952	Mr. House won't be a problem. He's been disconnected from his system.
GID00064953	I killed Mr. House.
GID00064954	I'm still working on it.
GID00064955	I was hoping to ask you some questions.
GID00064956	Is there no peaceful way to resolve this?
GID00064957	How do you expect me to destroy an entire Brotherhood chapter?
GID00064958	I thought the Brotherhood were all wiped out at HELIOS One. How could they have survived?
GID00064959	No ma'am.
GID00064960	The Brotherhood has been eliminated.
GID00064961	Not yet.
GID00064962	I was hoping to ask you some questions.
GID00064963	I talked the Brotherhood into supporting the NCR.
GID00064964	The president has departed safely.
GID00064965	The president was killed by assassins.
GID00064966	I don't know. The visit is still going on up there.
GID00064967	I was hoping to ask you some questions.
GID00064968	What can I do to help?
GID00064969	I can handle them, no problem.
GID00064970	I'll take care of it.
GID00064971	You won't mind if I kill them?
GID00064972	The mongrels won't touch me. Animals like me.
GID00064973	You thought wrong.
GID00064974	I need to think about this.
GID00064975	Let's do this.
GID00064976	You call that a challenge? Ha.
GID00064977	Nice dog.
GID00064978	What did you need help with?
GID00064979	Uhh... wouldn't Sergeant Teddy be dead?
GID00064980	They let you have toys here?
GID00064981	I can't help you with that right now.
GID00064982	I'll see what I can do.
GID00064983	Goodbye.
GID00064984	Here you go.
GID00064985	Not so fast. What will you give me for him?
GID00064986	< Tear Sergeant Teddy in half. >
GID00064987	That's enough about the arena. Let's talk about something else.
GID00064988	What are the rules?
GID00064989	Who does the fighting?
GID00064990	What do you do?
GID00064991	I'm ready.
GID00064992	Got it. I'm ready.
GID00064993	I need some time to prepare.
GID00064994	Never mind.
GID00064995	I'm ready.
GID00064996	I'm ready.
GID00064997	Do you have anything for sale?
GID00064998	< Survival 20 >
GID00064999	You are using one broc flower per xander root, right?
GID00065000	Maybe you could try using different plants and herbs?
GID00065001	Never mind.
GID00065002	<Mike Lawson Warning Greeting>
GID00065003	Any idea where I might find those books?
GID00065004	Where you want me to look for them books?

GID00065220	Your friends are safe.
GID00065221	They're still in the mine.
GID00065222	Were they the NCR hostages in the mine?
GID00065223	They're already dead.
GID00065224	I got them out alive.
GID00065225	Captain Gilles at Bitter Springs needs reinforcements. Can you spare any?
GID00065228	Wanted to ask some questions about the outpost.
GID00065232	Do you think about Bitter Springs a lot?
GID00065233	Maybe it would help to go back there.
GID00065234	What changed your mind?
GID00065235	Okay. We'll make it a point to stop there.
GID00065236	I don't really have time for this now, Boone.

GID00065251	How can I help with medical supplies?
GID00065252	What's this about someone killing refugees?
GID00065253	I'd like to ask about something else.
GID00065254	What happened to this town?
GID00065255	How did you survive?
GID00065256	Why are you still here?
GID00065257	I found this supply cache in a cave up the mountain. Maybe it will help.
GID00065258	I found these supply caches in some caves up the mountain. Maybe they'll help.
GID00065259	I found another supply cache for the camp.
GID00065260	Medical texts? Aren't you a doctor?
GID00065261	Major psycho-what-now?
GID00065262	I'll keep my eyes open for books on pediatrics or psychological trauma, then.
GID00065263	I'll look out for... books like what you said.
GID00065264	My friend here is a doctor, maybe he could give you some training in those areas instead.
GID00065265	<Lie, give radioactive supplies> These supplies should be "helpful." Enjoy them.
GID00065267	These supplies are irradiated, but if we filter them with Rad-X they'll be safe.
GID00065268	These supplies are radioactive, so swallow lots of lead before you eat them.
GID00065269	Goodbye.
GID00065270	Why is the flag upside down?
GID00065271	Are you aware that your flag is upside down?
GID00065272	Captain Gilles said to talk to you about medical aid for the camp.
GID00065273	What kind of medical aid are you looking for again?
GID00065274	What kind of medical aid are you looking for again?
GID00065275	What kind of medical aid are you looking for again?
GID00065276	What kind of aid were you looking for again?
GID00065277	I found one of those books you wanted.
GID00065278	I found those books you wanted.
GID00065279	I found another book for you.
GID00065280	What can I do to help?
GID00065281	What is this place?
GID00065282	Are things going better at the camp now?
GID00065283	How are things around the camp?
GID00065284	DELETE THIS
GID00065285	Better for her to die than live a Legion slave.
GID00065286	You should've tried to rescue her. Even if it meant your death.
GID00065287	You had no right to make that decision.
GID00065288	You make it sound like your wife's death was inevitable.
GID00065289	Why do you think you've got bad things coming?
GID00065290	I don't understand.
GID00065291	Let's talk about something else.
GID00065292	You're not going to tell me?
GID00065293	Were you at Bitter Springs with First Recon?
GID00065294	You must've been at Bitter Springs. What happened there?
GID00065295	That's it? You won?
GID00065296	I've seen my share of terrible things. You can talk to me about it.
GID00065297	How can you say that? We've been fighting together.
GID00065298	Tell me about it.
GID00065299	You want me to make good on my promise to fight the Legion with you, is that it?
GID00065300	Sounded like more of a massacre.
GID00065301	Must've been one hell of a miscommunication.
GID00065302	There must be more to it than that.
GID00065303	Sounds like you have some regrets.
GID00065304	That's true. You can't second guess what you do out there.
GID00065305	Being a mindless drone is just as dangerous. You have to think for yourself.
GID00065306	It is because of Bitter Springs that you think you've got bad things coming?
GID00065307	Maybe you can make up for your mistakes.
GID00065308	Life doesn't work that way. Your misfortunes are just bad luck.
GID00065309	If it's out of your control, why worry about it?
GID00065310	How do you know your punishment isn't over?
GID00065311	I helped Troike out, like you asked.
GID00065312	I finished that work for Clanden.
GID00065313	I finished all the work you had for me.
GID00065314	Saint James and Dermot were behind it. They're dead now.
GID00065315	I found this evidence in their rooms - they attacked when I confronted them.
GID00065316	Proof enough. Let's talk about my reward.
GID00065317	I'll keep looking.
GID00065318	I'll keep looking.
GID00065319	Any ideas what to look for?
GID00065320	Any ideas what to look for?
GID00065321	I found all the evidence you'll need from Saint James' and Dermot's rooms. Here.
GID00065322	What is it you aren't telling me about what happened to your wife?
GID00065323	I don't feel like I can trust you.
GID00065324	I want to understand you better.
GID00065325	You're right. I was out of line.
GID00065326	I think it's time you told me what happened to your wife.
GID00065327	You're hiding something. Spit it out. You owe me.
GID00065328	The better we understand each other, the more effective we'll be.
GID00065329	I just want to know.
GID00065330	Goodbye.
GID00065331	I didn't mention Aerotech.
GID00065332	Um, what is an "Aerotech?"
GID00065333	And yet you know the missing people are refugees.
GID00065334	But you got to know more than me!
GID00065335	Will you pay a bounty for NCR troops I kill?
GID00065336	<BARTER, player asks to use dog tags as currency for supplies>
GID00065337	If you trade me ammo and supplies instead, I can stay in the area, racking up kills.
GID00065338	How many dog tags to get your helmet?
GID00065339	I'll come back when I've made some kills.
GID00065340	One.
GID00065341	Two.
GID00065342	Three.
GID00065343	Here, take all the dog tags I've got.
GID00065344	Five.
GID00065345	Never mind.
GID00065346	I have more to turn in.
GID00065347	That's all for now.
GID00065348	I'm ready to travel with you.
GID00065349	I can't believe you just said that.
GID00065350	Skip the puns. What is this idea you have?
GID00065351	Of course I will be. I'm the best at everything.
GID00065352	Okay you talked me into it.
GID00065353	I couldn't care less.
GID00065354	I'll kill you for asking.
GID00065355	That is the stupidest joke I've heard.
GID00065356	That's hilarious. You think of it on your own?
GID00065357	Sign me up.
GID00065358	Count me out.
GID00065359	Skip the jokes. I'm in.
GID00065360	I love fighting. I'm going back out there now.
GID00065361	I still don't know.
GID00065362	If you're looking for someone in particular, I could tip you off if I see them.
GID00065363	Who were you looking for? Come on, you can tell me. Please?
GID00065364	Sorry, no one parts me from my weapons.
GID00065365	Yep, let's rock.
GID00065366	Do you have any rooms available?
GID00065367	What is there to do around here?
GID00065368	<Lie> Well Nero didn't tell me any of this when he convinced me to take you out.
GID00065369	I've got a message for you, from Carlitos.
GID00065370	Have you actually tried that?
GID00065371	Goodbye.
GID00065372	Who are you?
GID00065373	I'll be back later. Don't go running off anywhere.
GID00065374	Sorry, not interested.
GID00065375	All right. I'll do it.
GID00065376	Not good enough.
GID00065377	About that favor you owe me...
GID00065378	I'm not interested.
GID00065379	I don't want to abuse Mr. House's trust.
GID00065380	Because I don't give a shit about the Followers or anyone else in this dump.
GID00065381	I have to go.
GID00065382	Dr. &PCName; diagnoses a terminally low discussion of caps in this conversation.
GID00065383	Yeah, well I'm suffering from a lack of caps. What can you do for me?
GID00065384	So, are you... paying me for this?
GID00065385	What do you do here?
GID00065386	Goodbye.
GID00065387	What happened to this Brahmin?
GID00065388	Is the dead Brahmin contagious?
GID00065389	I'm not exactly a friend of the Legion, you know.
GID00065390	I could probably find a use for some of this meat.
GID00065391	< Speech Option >
GID00065392	I'll just keep bugging you until you say yes, you know.
GID00065393	Tell Caesar I accept his invitation.
GID00065394	Do you work for one of the casinos?
GID00065395	Mr. House gets half of each day's take?
GID00065396	You bet, I'm parched.
GID00065397	No thanks.
GID00065398	Tell me about Freeside.
GID00065399	What about The Kings?
GID00065400	Let's talk about something else.
GID00065401	What do you think of the NCR?
GID00065402	What's your opinion of Mr. House?
GID00065403	What do you think of the Followers of the Apocalypse?
GID00065404	What do you know about the Van Graffs?
GID00065405	This would be as an "escort."
GID00065406	When I say "escort," I mean "prostitute."
GID00065407	Turns out there are customers looking for someone just like you.
GID00065408	<Speech>
GID00065409	You'd be an independent - with a deep discount on the booze, maybe?
GID00065410	Let's face it... this is the only way you're going to get any action.
GID00065411	Never mind.
GID00065412	It's not like you'd be a slave. You'd get to choose your clients.
GID00065413	You'll be paid well, and room and board is on the house.
GID00065414	Perhaps a bottle of Jacob's Absinthe might convince you?
GID00065415	Goodbye.
GID00065416	Sorry Jacob, I haven't found those chems yet.
GID00065417	Goodbye.
GID00065418	Can you forge a handwritten note for me?
GID00065419	I need a note written to Pacer from Jean-Baptiste Cutting.
GID00065420	Just that Jean-Baptiste has Pacer's jet.
GID00065421	[Intelligence] How did you get enough money to enter The Strip?
GID00065422	What does it involve?
GID00065423	I don't have the time right now.
GID00065424	Stop bugging me.
GID00065425	The King wants to help with the relief effort.
GID00065426	Which are?
GID00065427	Sure. Serve me up something.
GID00065428	Ah, not right now. Thanks.
GID00065429	What are you serving?
GID00065430	Do you know anything about NCR soldiers here in Freeside?
GID00065431	The King thinks those troops have been attacking Locals.
GID00065432	Can you tell me anything else about them?
GID00065433	Nothing, let's talk about something else.
GID00065434	I'll head over right away.
GID00065435	I'll look into it when I can.
GID00065436	The Local men were attacked by soldiers. One of the men was identified by rank.
GID00065437	They're only handing out supplies to NCR citizens.
GID00065438	I'm still looking into the matter.
GID00065439	I wanted to ask you some questions.
GID00065440	They refuse to serve Locals.
GID00065441	I still haven't found anything.
GID00065442	Can I ask you a few questions?
GID00065443	It seemed fairly innocent.
GID00065444	What are you going to do?
GID00065445	They said someone was sent to discuss the issue with you.
GID00065446	Let's not act rashly here.
GID00065447	They said the man was severely beaten and barely survived.
GID00065448	The man was attacked and driven off. He never arrived.
GID00065457	I left one of my companions in the freezer for your enjoyment.
GID00065460	I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry.
GID00065461	Do you serve food to Locals as well?
GID00065462	Yes, but I was afraid he wouldn't get served.
GID00065463	No, I was just curious.
GID00065464	Why don't you serve Locals?
GID00065465	Why not?
GID00065466	Julie Farkas told me to ask. She said it was important.
GID00065467	And the King refused?
GID00065468	What happened?
GID00065469	Let me guess, something bad happened to the envoy.
GID00065470	I thought I'd save everyone some time and just kill you.
GID00065471	That wasn't him. He didn't even know an envoy was sent.
GID00065472	What's my silence worth to you?
GID00065473	That's a good start...
GID00065474	That's it?
GID00065475	Thanks. I suddenly forgot what I was going to tell the King.
GID00065476	I still think he should know about it.
GID00065477	You're right. He shouldn't be bothered with rumors right now.
GID00065478	Thanks. This will keep me warm while I tell the story to the King.
GID00065479	What's your trick?
GID00065480	Who is Michael Angelo?
GID00065481	Tell me again about Michael Angelo.
GID00065482	Tell me again about Michael Angelo.
GID00065483	I better go.
GID00065484	I heard your family has a grudge against a King named Pacer.
GID00065485	I was thinking of raiding his jet stash.
GID00065486	Why don't you just kill him?
GID00065487	Tell me about the Van Graffs.
GID00065488	Tell me about your siblings.
GID00065489	Tell me about yourself.
GID00065490	What are the symptoms of Hydra use?
GID00065491	People using Hydra have their skin turn purple, right?
GID00065492	What do you know about Hoover Dam?
GID00065493	What's your take on the NCR?
GID00065494	Tell me about the first battle.
GID00065495	Must have been rough.
GID00065496	Let's go back to my previous questions.
GID00065497	Let's talk about something else.
GID00065498	Thanks, I appreciate it.
GID00065499	Whatever it is, I think you need it more than I do.
GID00065500	Then why did I find this empty syringe in your pocket?
GID00065501	Private Sexton mentioned you wander around the camp at night.
GID00065502	I know what's really going on. You can trust me.
GID00065503	Yeah, right. Why don't you tell me what's really going on?
GID00065504	I sometimes do the same thing.
GID00065505	For some reason I don't believe you.
GID00065506	You filed a report which said Legion Super Mutants wiped out an NCR patrol.
GID00065507	What are you doing out here?
GID00065508	Anything I can do to help?
GID00065509	Let's talk about something else.
GID00065510	Why are you out here alone?
GID00065511	I'll take a look and see if there's anything I can do.
GID00065512	You sure they're still alive?
GID00065513	Extra encouragement would also increase their chances.
GID00065514	Alright. It can't hurt to try.
GID00065515	The odds are too small. You're on your own.
GID00065516	It's your own damn fault. Help them yourself.
GID00065517	I changed my mind. I'll save your squad.
GID00065518	I'm going nowhere in particular.
GID00065519	I have no time to talk right now.
GID00065520	Yes. But why does that matter to you?
GID00065521	Sorry. I need to go.
GID00065522	Okay I will help you.
GID00065523	I really can't do that.
GID00065524	What are you doing out here alone?
GID00065525	Armed? Look at these biceps!
GID00065526	And what would you need me for?
GID00065527	Just those? You calling me weak? I'll show you weak!
GID00065528	I can't help you right now.
GID00065532	Hit me with a stimpak, Doc.
GID00065533	<Pay 10 caps>
GID00065534	Heal me up completely.
GID00065535	I've got some wounds I need you to look at.
GID00065536	<Pay 50 caps>
GID00065537	<Pay 25 caps>
GID00065538	<Pay 75 caps>
GID00065539	<Pay 40 caps>
GID00065540	I could use another hit with a stimpak.
GID00065541	Just staple it all together. I'll fix my gimpy bits later.
GID00065542	<Pay 50 caps>
GID00065543	<Pay 25 caps>
GID00065544	What's in it for me?
GID00065545	Why can't you take care of this yourself?
GID00065546	I'll check up on her for you.
GID00065547	I'll consider it.
GID00065548	Why is your bodyguard allowed to have a gun?
GID00065549	I need medical treatment.
GID00065550	I have wounds that need mending.
GID00065551	I need help with an addiction.
GID00065552	Can you heal my radiation?
GID00065553	I need medical supplies.
GID00065554	Do it.
GID00065555	Here's your 100 caps. Do it.
GID00065556	I don't have 100 caps.
GID00065557	No, thanks.
GID00065558	Yes, cure me.
GID00065559	Yes, cure me. Here's 50 caps.
GID00065560	I can't afford treatment. I don't have 50 caps.
GID00065561	No, thanks.
GID00065562	Fix me.
GID00065563	Okay, fix me. Here's 50 caps.
GID00065564	Sorry, I don't have 50 caps.
GID00065565	No, thanks.
GID00065566	Actually, I changed my mind.
GID00065567	I'd like to trade.
GID00065568	<Attack>
GID00065569	< Speech Option >
GID00065570	The Legion is watching out for this woman. Go ahead, cross them. I dare you.
GID00065571	Kill her and Caesar's Legion will get you.
GID00065572	What's going on here?
GID00065573	Do whatever you want. I just want to loot the room.
GID00065574	What is there to do here?
GID00065575	What's playing at the Aces right now?
GID00065576	Where did you take my weapons?
GID00065577	What's the situation here?
GID00065578	I was in the area, that's all.
GID00065579	How can I help break the stalemate?
GID00065580	I'll be on my way.
GID00065581	Why haven't you attacked the enemy?
GID00065582	I'll be on my way.
GID00065583	You're demoralizing the enemy by leaving them alone?
GID00065584	I've already killed everyone at Camp Forlorn Hope.
GID00065585	How can I help break the stalemate?
GID00065586	I'll be on my way.
GID00065587	How can I help break the stalemate?
GID00065588	I'll be on my way.
GID00065589	I've slaughtered the enemy at Camp Forlorn Hope.
GID00065590	Sounds like fun. I'll be right back.
GID00065591	No offense intended. Carry on.
GID00065592	I'll be on my way.
GID00065593	Goodbye.
GID00065594	I'm going to kill everyone at Camp Forlorn Hope.
GID00065595	What's the situation here?
GID00065596	I've slaughtered the enemy at Camp Forlorn Hope.
GID00065597	Why haven't you attacked the enemy?
GID00065598	How can I help break the stalemate?
GID00065599	Nothing new to report, actually.
GID00065600	I've slaughtered the enemy at Camp Forlorn Hope.
GID00065601	I'll carry your blade with honor.
GID00065602	Why would I want a piece of shit machete?
GID00065603	You earned your blade. Keep it.
GID00065604	Here you go. <Hand over all weapons>
GID00065605	Okay. <Keep holdout weapons>
GID00065606	Nevermind, I'll be back.
GID00065607	I have news from Carlitos.
GID00065608	He'll meet us in Freeside around midnight. I'll sneak you out in disguise.
GID00065609	He'll meet us in Freeside around midnight. I'll sneak you out in disguise.
GID00065610	Are you ready to get out?
GID00065611	Let's do this.
GID00065612	Wait a minute.
GID00065613	Never mind. Let's get you out of here.
GID00065614	Are you ready to get out?
GID00065615	Let's head out.
GID00065616	Let me make sure I'm ready.
GID00065617	Goodbye.
GID00065618	Sure, here you go.
GID00065619	<Keep holdout weapons> Sure, here you go.
GID00065620	Why do you need my guns?
GID00065621	Five words: From. My. Cold. Dead. Hands.
GID00065622	I've got a better idea. How about I kill you and take my guns in anyways?
GID00065623	What is your assignment?
GID00065624	So there's no hope in Hope.
GID00065625	Wow. Bringing up morale must be a difficult.
GID00065626	Hell yeah. Tell me about it.
GID00065627	I don't know. It doesn't sound very good.
GID00065628	Here are some ears.
GID00065629	Let's talk about something else.
GID00065630	I don't want to talk.
GID00065631	Are you complaining?
GID00065632	About that competition.
GID00065633	Have you heard anything about Dr. Richards' missing medical supplies?
GID00065634	Sign me up.
GID00065635	Maybe another time.
GID00065636	How's the morale doing?
GID00065637	What makes you think that?
GID00065638	That's all I need.
GID00065639	I need some injuries patched up.
GID00065641	1000 caps? Sounds good. <Give the Platinum Chip to Mr. House.>
GID00065642	[Barter] for better terms.
GID00065643	It's a great start... but well below market price.
GID00065644	Raise your price or... or... you'll be "chip outta luck."
GID00065645	I'll hang on to the Chip for now.
GID00065646	I can get a better price elsewhere.
GID00065647	I guess I'll accept your original offer.
GID00065648	I can do better.
GID00065649	What happens next?
GID00065650	You think your Securitrons can defeat Caesar's Legion *and* the NCR?
GID00065651	I'll be on my way, Mr. House.
GID00065652	How do I open the hatch?
GID00065653	What's inside the hatch?
GID00065654	All right, I'll do as you ask.
GID00065655	Why should I be working for you?
GID00065656	No thanks, Mr. House.
GID00065657	How do I open the hatch?
GID00065658	And what then? You want me to kill Caesar?
GID00065659	It's not safe for me to go back. The Legion will attack me on sight.
GID00065660	I'm still looking into it.
GID00065661	I've found evidence of an Omerta plot.
GID00065662	The Omertas who were conspiring against you are dead.
GID00065663	What's the next step?
GID00065664	I've secured their loyalty. They'll do as I say.
GID00065665	The Boomers and I don't get along. I'd rather keep my distance.
GID00065666	I had to wipe out their leadership.
GID00065667	The Brotherhood of Steel has been wiped out.
GID00065668	When the Legion assaults the dam, the Brotherhood will attack the NCR and weaken them.
GID00065669	I'm done working for you.
GID00065670	I'm going to kill you now, Mr. House.
GID00065671	It was an accident.
GID00065672	My only regret is that he got away.
GID00065673	I did my best, but the Legion did better.
GID00065674	So Kimball's dead. So what?
GID00065675	Of course. Here it is.
GID00065676	I have some questions to ask first...
GID00065677	Not so fast, Mr. House. We need to discuss payment.
GID00065678	I'm not going to give you the Chip.
GID00065679	What happens next?
GID00065680	You could work off your debt.
GID00065681	Work for James Garret as an escort.
GID00065682	<Lie and give 600 caps> I collected all of the debts.
GID00065683	I don't have the caps.
GID00065684	I'd like to browse your special inventory.
GID00065685	I'd like to browse your special inventory.
GID00065686	I've noticed Legionaries prefer using machetes as weapons.
GID00065687	How are women treated around here?
GID00065694	Mortimer wants to release the kid, if he'll cooperate. I'm the negotiator.
GID00065695	Your naked body, stud. Go into the dumpster and I'll meet you after I change.
GID00065696	I'm just here to talk.
GID00065697	You keep tilting your head to one side. Is your neck okay?
GID00065698	I can get that out for you. <Apply Sleeper Hold>
GID00065699	Try breathing deeply three times and then blowing on your thumb.
GID00065700	Did you know there's a nerve in your neck that helps you sleep? <Strike Nerve>
GID00065701	Look out, behind you! <Pistol Whip Carlyle>
GID00065702	Let's talk about something else.
GID00065703	You. You don't seem like you fit in here.
GID00065704	Never mind.
GID00065705	What's so bad about your reputation?
GID00065706	Joining the White Glove Society could clear your name. They're respected.
GID00065707	Talk to a man named Mortimer. He's looking for some big-name new members.
GID00065708	<Lie> I'll do it. Where can I find Ted Gunderson?
GID00065709	<Lie> I'll do the job you proposed. Where do I find Ted Gunderson?
GID00065710	Wouldn't putting St. Clair's body into a dumpster give it a terrible taste?
GID00065711	I trapped Carlyle St. Clair in the dumpster outside his house.
GID00065712	I sent Carlyle St. Clair to come and speak with you.
GID00065713	Carlyle St. Clair is dead.
GID00065714	Never mind, let's talk about Joana.
GID00065715	How do I get her out of Gomorrah?
GID00065716	Where in Freeside will you meet us?
GID00065717	Okay, I'm on it.
GID00065718	Goodbye.
GID00065719	How do I get her out of Gomorrah?
GID00065720	Where in Freeside will you meet us?
GID00065721	Okay, I'm on it.
GID00065722	Goodbye.
GID00065723	It's my pleasure.
GID00065724	Let's talk about my fee.
GID00065725	Goodbye.
GID00065726	No need. Helping you was enough.
GID00065727	I think 400 caps is a fair deal.
GID00065728	I think 400 caps is a fair deal.
GID00065729	Actually, I don't want anything.
GID00065730	Why don't you get her out of Gomorrah?
GID00065731	My help has a price.
GID00065732	200 caps will do.
GID00065733	My help has a price.
GID00065734	Joana's dead.
GID00065735	Joana's dead.
GID00065736	Your boss will hear about how you spoiled the mission.
GID00065737	You've got two choices. Live or die.
GID00065738	There's an opportunity for profit, here.
GID00065739	Let's finish this.
GID00065740	Your boss will hear about how you spoiled the mission.
GID00065741	Carlitos is trading what he stole for Joana. I was hired to see that he does.
GID00065742	Your boss kept it a secret. Carlitos would've not dealt directly with Omertas.
GID00065743	I... I was hired to, you know, draw Carlitos out of hiding.
GID00065744	Well, this is my... initiation test, to prove myself to the Omertas.
GID00065745	Your crew? You mean those little men shaking like leaves behind you?
GID00065746	Good! Today I haven't had a chance to crush anyone to a pulp, yet.
GID00065747	Leave us alone or I'll... I'll beat you and, yeah, your crew too, I think.
GID00065748	I'm going... to, to deal with you first, yeah. That's it.
GID00065749	A big profit. 500 caps for you and your men to enjoy as you wish.
GID00065750	A big profit. 500 caps would net you... well, lots of things, no?
GID00065751	Right, loyalty is worth more than, say, a 1000 caps.
GID00065752	Make it a 1000 caps. That's enough to betray the Omertas, no?
GID00065753	You've got two choices. Live or die.
GID00065754	There's an opportunity for profit, here.
GID00065755	Let's finish this.
GID00065756	You've got two choices. Live or die.
GID00065757	There's an opportunity for profit, here.
GID00065758	Let's finish this.
GID00065759	You should know that Heck's dead.
GID00065760	I have some questions for you.
GID00065761	Why was Heck such a threat to other ranchers?
GID00065762	You should know that Heck's dead.
GID00065763	I've dealt with the Gundersons.
GID00065764	You don't have to worry about Heck, ever again.
GID00065765	Ted's dead.
GID00065766	Heck and Ted are dead.
GID00065767	I've got some questions for you.
GID00065768	Two Gundersons, that's worth a 1000 caps at least.
GID00065769	I don't charge for good deeds.
GID00065770	Goodbye.
GID00065771	The big Gunderson's worth 750 caps, at least.
GID00065772	The young Gunderson's worth 500 caps, at least.
GID00065773	I've news about Heck Gunderson.
GID00065774	I don't charge for good deeds.
GID00065775	Sounds good.
GID00065776	Goodbye.
GID00065777	Sounds good.
GID00065778	I don't charge for good deeds.
GID00065779	Goodbye.
GID00065780	Sounds good.
GID00065781	I don't charge for good deeds.
GID00065782	Goodbye.
GID00065783	We said 400 for information about Heck, right?
GID00065784	We do.
GID00065785	I'm not interested right now.
GID00065786	Okay, 200 for information about Heck, right?
GID00065787	We do.
GID00065788	I'm not interested right now.
GID00065789	Wait, what?
GID00065790	Got it.
GID00065791	Is anything wrong?
GID00065792	Just thought I'd stop in and say hello.
GID00065793	For starters, what in the hell just happened?
GID00065794	I thought you hated the NCR?
GID00065795	Just start at the beginning.
GID00065796	So now the Van Graffs are allied with the NCR?
GID00065797	Wouldn't you have made just as much money dealing with the Legion?
GID00065798	What will you do now?
GID00065799	It's complicated. Hanlon caused the misinformation, but I convinced him to stop.
GID00065800	That's not important. It's over.
GID00065801	He wanted to scare the NCR into retreating from this region - all to save lives.
GID00065802	Can't you snipe the captives from up here?
GID00065803	Sorry, not interested.
GID00065804	What would I have to do?
GID00065805	Okay, I'll do it.
GID00065806	How about I rescue them instead?
GID00065807	Sorry, not interested.
GID00065808	I put the captives out of their misery.
GID00065809	Looks like I was able to get a few of the hostages out alive.
GID00065810	Nothing new to report on my end.
GID00065811	What can I do to help?
GID00065812	Never mind. See you around.
GID00065813	I'll be going then.
GID00065814	Yes, I'll do it.
GID00065818	Did one of your contractors get lost?
GID00065819	As a last request, will you tell me more about your plan?
GID00065820	Err.. can you tell me what the plan was?
GID00065821	So tell me about your plan.
GID00065822	I'm ready.
GID00065823	I'd like to talk first.
GID00065824	Goodbye.
GID00065825	I want to talk about Carlitos.
GID00065826	I'd like to know more about you.
GID00065827	I have questions about Gomorrah.
GID00065828	What can you tell me about the Omertas?
GID00065829	Tell me about your problem.
GID00065830	I want to talk about Carlitos.
GID00065831	What can you tell me about the Omertas?
GID00065832	Goodbye.
GID00065833	Let's go back to my other questions.
GID00065834	Goodbye.
GID00065835	Tell me about the Omertas.
GID00065836	Tell me about Cachino.
GID00065837	I want to know about Carlitos.
GID00065838	I have other questions.
GID00065839	Goodbye.
GID00065840	I want to talk about Carlitos.
GID00065841	I have questions about you.
GID00065842	Goodbye.
GID00065843	About your problem, let's go to your room.
GID00065844	Tell me about the Omertas.
GID00065845	I want to know about Cachino.
GID00065846	I'd like to talk about Carlitos.
GID00065847	I have questions about you.
GID00065848	Tell me about Gomorrah.
GID00065849	What can you tell me about the Omertas?
GID00065850	I actually found you an escort who's a ghoul *and* a cowboy.
GID00065851	Her name's Beatrix, and she can start immediately.
GID00065852	I'll see what I can do.
GID00065853	Where did you get the gun, anyway?
GID00065854	What do you need artillery for?
GID00065855	What do you sell?
GID00065856	Let me see what you have for sale.
GID00065857	Tell me about the Strip.
GID00065858	Goodbye.
GID00065859	Why?
GID00065860	What can you tell me about the Omertas.
GID00065861	About your problem, let's go to your room.
GID00065862	You wanted a smooth-talker for an escort? I found one.
GID00065863	Santiago's your man.
GID00065864	Let's talk about Freeside.
GID00065865	What's all the fuss about the water pump?
GID00065866	Who are The Kings?
GID00065867	What do you know about Mick and Ralph?
GID00065868	Tell me about the Van Graffs.
GID00065869	What's the Atomic Wrangler?
GID00065870	Let's talk about something else.
GID00065871	I'd like to know more about Freeside.
GID00065872	Who is The King?
GID00065873	Who are the Van Graffs?
GID00065874	What's up with the Atomic Wrangler?
GID00065875	What sort of show are you talking about?
GID00065876	Where do I find the Aces Theater?
GID00065877	Get away from me.
GID00065878	Who is the Lonesome Drifter?
GID00065879	Who's Bruce Issac?
GID00065880	Where do I find the Aces Theater?
GID00065881	<Player dismisses Promoter>
GID00065882	Goodbye.
GID00065883	<Player asks about the Chairmen>
GID00065885	I wanted to check on the troopers sent from Camp Forlorn Hope.
GID00065886	I heard sounds of a struggle in the Ultra-Luxe Penthouse.
GID00065887	I've heard your group dines on human flesh.
GID00065888	I, too, know what it is to feel the Craving. How can I support your cause?
GID00065889	<Lie> I, too, know what it is to feel the Craving. How can I support your cause?
GID00065890	<Lie> I sort of tasted human flesh once. Mmm mmm good. Tell me all your secrets.
GID00065891	So it isn't true?
GID00065892	Let's talk about something else.
GID00065893	Do you have any work that needs to be done?
GID00065894	The main course is a person?
GID00065895	[Attack] He's the least of your problems right now, cannibal.
GID00065896	I think you have the wrong person for this job.
GID00065897	What did you do?
GID00065898	Arcade.
GID00065899	Tell me what I need to do.
GID00065900	What about the boy you kidnapped?
GID00065901	I'll do it.
GID00065902	I'll think about it.
GID00065903	[Attack] I can't let you get away with what you've done.
GID00065904	<Hushed> Would my companion here make a suitable replacement meal?
GID00065905	Boone.
GID00065906	Cass.
GID00065907	Veronica.
GID00065908	I'll do the job you proposed.
GID00065909	I framed Heck Gunderson and sent a Securitron to arrest him.
GID00065910	Did you succeed in turning the White Glove Society back to cannibalism?
GID00065911	Not yet.
GID00065912	I convinced Ted it was all a terrible misunderstanding.
GID00065913	Ted Gunderson is dead. He wouldn't listen to reason.
GID00065914	Couldn't Heck just claim intruders killed his son?
GID00065915	I planted evidence in Heck Gunderson's room.
GID00065916	Your dad's powerful. Someone wants him to feud with the White Glove Society.
GID00065917	Er... probably just some mixed up people who are really sorry.
GID00065918	I'm here on Joana's behalf.
GID00065919	She didn't know if you were still alive.
GID00065920	Goodbye.
GID00065921	First, let me ask you some questions.
GID00065922	I'll let her know.
GID00065923	Will you answer my questions now?
GID00065924	Okay, I'll let her know that you'll help.
GID00065925	I'll try, but not for free.
GID00065926	200 caps and we have a deal.
GID00065927	Never mind. I don't need anything.
GID00065928	I'll try talking with her, but not for free.
GID00065929	Does the name "Carlitos" ring a bell?
GID00065930	What sort of debt do you owe Carlitos?
GID00065931	Never mind.
GID00065932	Carlitos is ready to cash in his chips.
GID00065933	Carlitos says he's ready to cash in his chips.
GID00065934	The "where" is Freeside, and "now" would be a good time.
GID00065935	What sort of debt do you owe Carlitos?
GID00065936	What's this place?
GID00065937	I'm looking for Michael Angelo.
GID00065938	Goodbye.
GID00065939	Who is Michael Angelo?
GID00065940	Where can I find Michael Angelo?
GID00065941	How long have you worked here?
GID00065942	Count me in.
GID00065943	I can't right now.
GID00065944	I'm in.
GID00065945	In that case, I'm out.
GID00065946	Who is this girl?
GID00065947	I'll do it.
GID00065948	I've changed my mind. I'll take the job.
GID00065949	Count me out.
GID00065950	Just thought I'd say hi.
GID00065951	She's dead.
GID00065952	I'm working on it.
GID00065953	I am.
GID00065954	Maybe.
GID00065955	I'm sorry, you've mistaken me for someone else.
GID00065956	Who is we?
GID00065957	It's right here.
GID00065958	Where's the payment?
GID00065959	My employers managed to negotiate a small fee for this drop a short time ago.
GID00065960	Surely you were told to pay the Van Graffs' messenger?
GID00065961	Never mind, I must have confused this with one of my other deliveries.
GID00065962	What were you informed of?
GID00065963	A little morbid, isn't it?
GID00065964	I have some questions about the NCR.
GID00065965	How do things look around the camp?
GID00065966	What's your take on the NCR's position here?
GID00065967	Let's talk about something else.
GID00065968	Let's do this.
GID00065969	I'm not ready yet.
GID00065970	Let's attack from the north.
GID00065971	We should attack from the ridge on the east.
GID00065972	Judging from the economic state of Freeside, they can't be paying you that much.
GID00065973	Sure, since this is the only casino in the whole town, you must make a ton!
GID00065974	Really? How much are you making?
GID00065975	Sure, I bet you're raking in the cash in this dump.
GID00065976	I could talk to Garret and try to convince him to let you go.
GID00065977	Well, tough luck. Let me know if you change your mind.
GID00065978	Milo Initiate
GID00065979	How rude.
GID00065980	Hey there.
GID00065984	I could pay you.
GID00065985	He's not the right fit for this place. You'll find better performers.
GID00065986	But how much do you lose on folk not coming into a place with a ghoul performer?
GID00065987	If you don't I'll tear out your spleen and then rip this place down.
GID00065988	I'll pay you 100 and not a cap more.
GID00065989	Here you go, 150 caps.
GID00065990	I'll come back when I have enough.
GID00065991	Here you go.
GID00065992	I'll come back when I have enough.
GID00065993	Here you go.
GID00065994	Fine, I'll come up with something later.
GID00065996	Tell me about the Omertas.
GID00065997	What's the Omertas' role in Gomorrah?
GID00065998	Tell me about their leaders.
GID00065999	Goodbye.
GID00066000	Tell me about their leaders.
GID00066001	I want to talk about Carlitos.
GID00066002	Carlitos wants to get you out of here.
GID00066003	I want to talk about something else.
GID00066004	Goodbye.
GID00066005	You keep avoiding my questions. Are you bothered by them?
GID00066006	Joana, you can trust me. Why are you avoiding my questions?
GID00066007	You don't look good. Are you... ill or something?
GID00066008	Contracted pupils, involuntary spasms... Med-X kills quickly, Joana. I can help.
GID00066009	All right. Lead the way.
GID00066010	Let me ask you something else.
GID00066011	Trust me, I'll keep you safe.
GID00066012	I... don't know, but we'll figure it out.
GID00066013	I had other questions first.
GID00066014	You'll never see them again, you have my word.
GID00066015	Don't worry, I'll tell him that you are happy to hear from him.
GID00066016	I have other questions for you.
GID00066017	You'll just have to hope it all works out... I guess.
GID00066018	Consider it done.
GID00066019	What's the deal with Cachino?
GID00066020	What's happened to you?
GID00066021	Tell me about the Omertas.
GID00066022	Tell me about Cachino.
GID00066023	Goodbye.
GID00066024	What's Carlitos' story?
GID00066025	Cachino talked because Carlitos broke Omerta rules?
GID00066026	I know Carlitos.
GID00066027	Sorry, I'm not interested in this right now.
GID00066028	Tell me about your problem.
GID00066029	I've talked to Carlitos, but not about you.
GID00066030	All right. I'll talk to him.
GID00066031	What if Carlitos lives?
GID00066032	If he lives, I'll find him for you.
GID00066033	I'd like to know more about you.
GID00066034	I have questions about Gomorrah.
GID00066035	What can you tell me about the Omertas.
GID00066036	Anything...
GID00066037	Nothing, I'll find him for you.
GID00066038	200 caps would do, for now.
GID00066039	You know what I want, Joana.
GID00066040	Carlitos wants to get you out of here.
GID00066041	I want to ask you something else.
GID00066042	I expect something in return.
GID00066043	I want to talk about Carlitos.
GID00066044	So, you want me to talk to Carlitos?
GID00066045	I'll talk to him for you.
GID00066046	I expect something in return.
GID00066047	I know Carlitos.
GID00066048	I've talked to Carlitos, but not about you.
GID00066049	So, you want me to talk to Carlitos?
GID00066050	What do you know of the White Glove Society?
GID00066051	How could savage cannibals run the Ultra-Luxe?
GID00066052	How did you capture Benny?
GID00066053	What happened after Benny was caught?
GID00066054	What do you think of the NCR?
GID00066055	President Tandi was voted into office each time.
GID00066056	How is the NCR weak?
GID00066057	Surely, the NCR is a powerful foe?
GID00066058	What do you know about Mr. House?
GID00066059	What did you know about Mr. House?
GID00066060	What role will regional powers play in the conflict?
GID00066061	How did you rise to power?
GID00066062	You were a Follower of the Apocalypse?
GID00066063	What changed you from a Follower to dictator?
GID00066064	Why would learning dialects be a waste of time?
GID00066065	What was wrong with the Blackfoot?
GID00066066	What steps did you take?
GID00066067	What happened after you trained the Blackfoot?
GID00066068	What happened to the tribes?
GID00066069	And since forming the Legion, all you've done is conquer other tribes?
GID00066070	Why is Caesar's Legion so... strange?
GID00066071	What does "Pax Romana" mean?
GID00066072	So you'll destroy the NCR because you hate its inefficiencies?
GID00066073	"Hegelian Dialectics?" What are those?
GID00066074	So what's "dialectic" about you and the NCR?
GID00066075	Let me see what you have.
GID00066076	I'm looking for information.
GID00066077	Nothing right now.
GID00066078	I hear you have some exotic tastes when it comes to women.
GID00066079	Oh, I was just told to deliver a girl to the spare room you keep up here.
GID00066080	Well... I... I have some exotic tastes too!
GID00066081	I thought that maybe I could be your next playtoy. Your exploits are well known.
GID00066082	Sorry, I was thinking about someone else. I have a different question though.
GID00066083	Goodbye.
GID00066084	I think the authorities would like to hear these tapes I found in your safe.
GID00066085	I'll give you the tapes if you promise to leave Vegas and never come back, and give me 200 caps.
GID00066086	If you... um... give me 300 caps and leave Vegas, I'll keep these tapes safe.
GID00066087	I can't give you these tapes, they are evidence of a crime.
GID00066088	I always have what it takes.
GID00066089	I... don't know, uh, what does it take?
GID00066090	I just want to ask you some questions.
GID00066091	Goodbye.
GID00066093	I'd like to know more about you.
GID00066094	I have questions about Gomorrah.
GID00066095	What can you tell me about the Omertas?
GID00066097	I'll... I'm sure something good.
GID00066098	The better question is what are *you* going to do with it.
GID00066099	The better question is what are *you* going to do with it.
GID00066100	Lead the way.
GID00066101	Lead the way.
GID00066102	How does a 100 caps sound?
GID00066103	How does 75 caps sound?
GID00066104	I am. Lead the way.
GID00066105	I am. Lead the way.
GID00066106	Actually, I'm short on caps right now.
GID00066107	Actually, I'm short on caps right now.
GID00066108	I have some questions.
GID00066109	Actually, let me ask you some questions.
GID00066110	I just have some questions for you.
GID00066111	What's your story?
GID00066112	Do you like it here?
GID00066113	Let's talk about having fun.
GID00066114	Let's go back to my other questions.
GID00066115	What's the deal with Gomorrah?
GID00066116	Tell me about Gomorrah's clients.
GID00066117	I'm here for some fun.
GID00066118	Not so fast, Mr. House. We need to discuss payment.
GID00066119	I'm not going to give you the Chip.
GID00066120	Attack me and you risk destroying the Chip.
GID00066121	Here it is. <Give the Platinum Chip to Mr. House.>
GID00066122	I'm not afraid of you, Mr. House. The Platinum Chip belongs to me.
GID00066123	I think that sounds insane.
GID00066124	What do you want me to do there?
GID00066125	Caesar has already invited me to the Fort.
GID00066126	I've already visited Caesar.
GID00066127	No thanks, Mr. House.
GID00066128	I have some questions to ask first...
GID00066129	And what then?
GID00066130	Caesar has already invited me to the Fort.
GID00066131	I have some questions to ask first...
GID00066132	I'm not going to give you the Chip.
GID00066133	Not so fast, Mr. House. We need to discuss payment.
GID00066134	Let's talk about that mission after all.
GID00066135	I'll make it up to you. What do we do next?
GID00066136	What does the Platinum Chip do?
GID00066137	I'll be on my way. Goodbye.
GID00066138	What's my stake in this?
GID00066139	All right, I'll do as you ask.
GID00066140	What's inside the hatch?
GID00066141	You want the Chip? Here it is. <Give the Platinum Chip to Mr. House.>
GID00066142	Here it is. <Give the Platinum Chip to Mr. House.>
GID00066143	Here, take it. <Give the Platinum Chip to Mr. House.>
GID00066144	I'm still not giving you the Chip.
GID00066145	What happens next?
GID00066146	What does the Chip do, exactly?
GID00066147	I'll be on my way, then...
GID00066148	Why show your hand like that? Now your enemies know what you're up to.
GID00066149	You think your Securitrons can defeat Caesar's Legion *and* the NCR?
GID00066150	I'll be on my way, Mr. House.
GID00066151	I'm listening.
GID00066152	Let me ask some questions first.
GID00066153	The Chip's been delivered. We're through.
GID00066154	I guess you can tell me about the mission.
GID00066155	Let me ask some questions first.
GID00066156	No thanks, Mr. House.
GID00066157	I've already visited Caesar.
GID00066158	No thanks, Mr. House.
GID00066159	I'll do as you ask.
GID00066160	What will I find at Caesar's camp?
GID00066161	What's inside the hatch?
GID00066162	So you want me to go back there and kill Caesar?
GID00066163	What will I find at Caesar's camp?
GID00066164	Caesar has already invited me to the Fort.
GID00066165	I've already met with Caesar at the Fort.
GID00066166	No thanks, Mr. House.
GID00066167	I'm not planning to go to the Fort.
GID00066168	I'm not planning to visit the Fort.
GID00066169	All right, I'll do as you ask.
GID00066170	<Change the subject.>
GID00066171	I'm surprised you haven't asked what became of Benny.
GID00066172	What's my stake in this?
GID00066173	No thanks, Mr. House.
GID00066174	No thanks, Mr. House.
GID00066175	No thanks, Mr. House.
GID00066176	I have some questions to ask.
GID00066177	I do have questions to ask.
GID00066178	Like I said, I'm not interested.
GID00066179	I'll go to the Fort as you ask.
GID00066180	What's in it for me?
GID00066181	I'll do as you ask, Mr. House.
GID00066182	What's inside the hatch?
GID00066183	Fine, I'll do as you ask.
GID00066184	Got any advice to share?
GID00066185	<Barter>
GID00066186	One of the employee perks is a discount...
GID00066187	Caps are caps, honey. You can't be picky about how you make them!
GID00066188	You could be the next big thing at the Wrangler.
GID00066189	Let's talk about something else.
GID00066190	So, who are you?
GID00066191	I have some questions.
GID00066192	What are you doing with the Followers?
GID00066193	I bet you've seen a lot over the years.
GID00066194	I'm in the market for something a little unusual.
GID00066195	Sounds good to me. <Pay 25 caps.>
GID00066196	Maybe another time.
GID00066197	No chatty games, Santiago. I don't have time for this.
GID00066198	Goodbye.
GID00066199	James Garret is looking for a suave escort. Interested in some work?
GID00066200	I'd like to hire you for a bit.
GID00066201	Here you go. <Pay 25 caps>
GID00066202	That all you've got, robot?
GID00066203	What are you selling?
GID00066204	I've got the detox chems you need.
GID00066205	<Speech>
GID00066206	Jacob, be strong. You just need the support of your friends to get through this.
GID00066207	Jacob, drugs are for the weak.
GID00066208	Seems like you need a steady supply, not just whatever I can grab for you.
GID00066209	Which merchants might be willing to make a deal?
GID00066210	I need medical services.
GID00066211	A regular shipment of supplies is what you need here.
GID00066212	I have some medical supplies to drop off.
GID00066213	Med-X
GID00066214	Rad-Away
GID00066216	I've got a chem problem.
GID00066217	I've been exposed to radiation.
GID00066218	<Pay 50 caps>
GID00066219	Never mind.
GID00066220	<Pay 100 caps>
GID00066221	Never mind.
GID00066222	One.
GID00066223	Two.
GID00066224	Three.
GID00066225	One.
GID00066226	Two.
GID00066227	Three.
GID00066228	One.
GID00066229	Two.
GID00066230	Three.
GID00066231	That is all for now.
GID00066232	They just need tech support and raw materials.
GID00066233	The Garrets should be sending over supplies shortly.
GID00066234	Do you sell medical supplies?
GID00066235	I'd like to buy medical supplies.
GID00066236	<Pay 25 caps>
GID00066237	<Pay 50 caps>
GID00066238	Why charge for water?
GID00066239	How much for a drink?
GID00066240	Can I buy bottled water?
GID00066241	<Pay 10 caps>
GID00066242	Never mind.
GID00066243	Do you have any special items for sale?
GID00066244	No.
GID00066245	Yes.
GID00066246	The Followers are looking to work out a supply deal.
GID00066247	No.
GID00066248	Pacer, I won't let you ruin this opportunity.
GID00066249	I think that's up to the King.
GID00066250	I was afraid this would happen. Sergeant, you know what to do.
GID00066251	So you'll fight him *and* the NCR? Can the Kings afford to fight each other?
GID00066252	Just shut up and do what your leader tells you!
GID00066253	It appears the Kings are a worthless pack of thugs. Sergeant, they're all yours.
GID00066254	We're dealing with the King, not you.
GID00066255	The Followers are looking to set up a supply deal.
GID00066256	What if they are?
GID00066257	Freeside gets more food, water, and electricity.
GID00066258	The NCR is willing to help supply Freeside in exchange for peace.
GID00066259	Just hear them out. They're offering generous terms.
GID00066260	You stop the attacks on NCR citizens, and your supply problems disappear.
GID00066261	The Kings have to stop the violence against people from the NCR.
GID00066262	They're just here as an escort. Now do you want to hear their offer or not?
GID00066263	No catch. You just make sure no King attack an NCR citizen from now on.
GID00066264	I want to join the Kings.
GID00066265	Can you get me into the Strip?
GID00066266	I could really use some money...
GID00066267	I'd like to think about it.
GID00066268	I wanted to talk about something else.
GID00066269	I need you to stop the violence against NCR citizens in Freeside.
GID00066270	All I'm asking is that you try.
GID00066271	The Kings will follow your leadership.
GID00066272	Well, if you can't do it...
GID00066273	I need you to stop the violence against NCR citizens.
GID00066274	Can I join the Kings?
GID00066275	I need medical services.
GID00066276	I'm addicted to something.
GID00066277	I could use some patching up.
GID00066278	I have radiation sickness.
GID00066279	<Pay caps>
GID00066280	<Pay 50 caps>
GID00066281	<Pay 45 caps>
GID00066282	<Pay 40 caps>
GID00066283	No thanks.
GID00066284	<Pay caps>
GID00066285	<Pay 100 caps>
GID00066286	<Pay 90 caps>
GID00066287	<Pay 80 caps>
GID00066288	<Pay caps>
GID00066289	<Pay 100 caps>
GID00066290	<Pay 90 caps>
GID00066291	<Pay 80 caps>
GID00066292	<Pay caps>
GID00066293	<Pay 75 caps>
GID00066294	<Pay 67 caps>
GID00066295	<Pay 60 caps>
GID00066296	Never mind.
GID00066297	Rex? I picked him up in New Vegas.
GID00066298	<Lie> He just started following me one day. I have no idea where he came from.
GID00066299	Why do you want to know?
GID00066300	I don't have any more questions. Let's talk about something else.
GID00066301	How did you end up joining the Legion?
GID00066302	What happened to the rest of your tribe?
GID00066303	You don't hate the Legion for what it did to your tribe?
GID00066304	I have questions about something else.
GID00066305	What do you think about the NCR?
GID00066306	How did the NCR defeat the Legion at Hoover Dam before?
GID00066307	< Speech - 50 >
GID00066308	I'm a friend. It's okay for you to talk to friends, right?
GID00066309	I just have some questions. It'll probably be okay to talk to me.
GID00066310	Don't worry - I won't tell on you if you don't tell on me.
GID00066311	I'd like to report a murder at Gomorrah.
GID00066312	Sorry, I'll find some proof.
GID00066313	I found a dead girl in Gomorrah.
GID00066314	I found these tapes.
GID00066315	I can't say for sure.
GID00066316	No, but I'll find out for you.
GID00066317	It is a guy named Clanden.
GID00066318	Here are the caps. <pay 150 caps>
GID00066319	Never mind, I have some other questions though.
GID00066320	Would you happen to know where I could find a sexbot?
GID00066321	The Garrets are looking to satisfy certain customers.
GID00066322	Thanks, I'll check it out.
GID00066323	Is there a holotape or anything I'll need for the sexbot?
GID00066324	Good to know. I might have you make one later if I can't get it myself.
GID00066325	<Speech>
GID00066326	Ralph, I've been a loyal customer to you and Mick. How about 100 caps?
GID00066327	Can't you just call it a favor?
GID00066328	<Barter>
GID00066329	Data modules are rare but generally useless. How about 100 caps for your work?
GID00066330	50 caps is my best offer.
GID00066331	<Speech High>
GID00066332	Ralph, I've been directing a lot of business your direction. Call it a favor?
GID00066333	Is the holotape ready yet?
GID00066334	I'm short on caps right now. Maybe later.
GID00066335	Is there a holotape or anything I'll need for the sexbot?
GID00066336	I'm afraid so.
GID00066337	The violence needs to stop.
GID00066338	There's still time to solve this peacefully.
GID00066339	These men have orders to kill you all if you refuse. Are you sure?
GID00066340	And when you're dead? What will happen to their freedom then?
GID00066341	The NCR is far too powerful. Just give up.
GID00066342	The NCR is just trying to protect its people.
GID00066343	Actually, they want to make you an offer.
GID00066344	You've got them all wrong.
GID00066345	I was, uh, just sightseeing. Sorry to bother you.
GID00066346	Ambassador Crocker said to come see you about Freeside.
GID00066347	No ma'am.
GID00066348	This plan seems awfully confrontational.
GID00066349	Nope. I'm to go to Freeside and shoot up some Kings.
GID00066350	I had some questions.
GID00066351	Where does the Legion get its dogs?
GID00066352	Let's talk about something else.
GID00066353	You train these dogs?
GID00066374	Sounds like you're in trouble. What's the deal?
GID00066375	How high was that fall?
GID00066376	If Vault 21 is your "bottom of the barrel" then I'd say you could've done worse.
GID00066377	Let me ask you about New Vegas.
GID00066378	Tell me about The Strip.
GID00066379	What are the important players in town?
GID00066380	I've got other questions about you.
GID00066381	Any recommendations on where to go for some fun?
GID00066382	You worked in Gomorrah as a Croupier, uh? What was it like?
GID00066383	You spent some time at Gomorrah, then. What was it like?
GID00066384	Any important "wiseguys" that I should know about?
GID00066385	Anyone in Gomorrah you'd recommend for a good time?
GID00066386	Let me ask you something else.
GID00066387	What does Sarah do around here?
GID00066388	Why do you say that Vault 21 has come a long way?
GID00066389	I can keep a secret, Carlitos. About whom are you worried?
GID00066390	Wait a minute. What's that name again?
GID00066391	Tell me about your past.
GID00066392	So you live in Vault 21?
GID00066393	What did you say about working at Gomorrah?
GID00066394	Tell me again about the girl at Gomorrah that worries you.
GID00066395	Don't talk to me like that or I'll... I'll... have to get tough with you.
GID00066396	Why not? It looks private enough for a midnight stunt.
GID00066397	Why don't you get her out of Gomorrah?
GID00066398	How did Cachino get you out of the way?
GID00066399	I can talk to Joana for you.
GID00066400	I could talk to Joana for you, but it'll cost you 200 caps.
GID00066401	You know, paying a visit to Joana sounds like fun.
GID00066402	All right. I'll talk to her.
GID00066403	On second thought - let's wait.
GID00066404	All right. I'll talk to her.
GID00066405	On second thought - let's wait.
GID00066406	I want to talk about Joana.
GID00066407	I couldn't convince her to attempt a escape.
GID00066408	Joana's happy to hear from you and wants to escape Gomorrah.
GID00066409	I'll be back when I convince her.
GID00066413	What are you and he up to out here on the Strip?
GID00066414	Where are you from?
GID00066415	Goodbye.
GID00066416	Tell me again why the two of you came to the Strip.
GID00066417	What's so important about Heck Gunderson?
GID00066418	What's so important about Heck Gunderson?
GID00066419	Where are you from?
GID00066420	Where are you from?
GID00066421	What's life like as a Bighorn rancher?
GID00066422	Goodbye.
GID00066423	Goodbye.
GID00066424	What are you and he up to on the Strip?
GID00066425	Tell me again why the two of you came to the Strip.
GID00066426	Goodbye.
GID00066427	Where are you from?
GID00066428	Where are you from?
GID00066429	What are you and he up to on the Strip?
GID00066430	Tell me again what you and he are doing on the Strip?
GID00066431	What's life like as a Bighorn rancher?
GID00066432	What's life like as a Bighorn rancher?
GID00066433	Goodbye.
GID00066434	Goodbye.
GID00066435	What's the deal with this Heck Gunderson?
GID00066436	Goodbye.
GID00066437	I'll see what I can do.
GID00066438	If you can't talk him out of it, seems worthless for me to try.
GID00066439	Goodbye.
GID00066440	All right, I'll talk to him.
GID00066441	Maybe later.
GID00066442	Goodbye.
GID00066443	Is there some way I could help you out?
GID00066444	Is there some way I could help you out?
GID00066445	What's so important about this Heck Gunderson?
GID00066446	What's life like as a Bighorn rancher?
GID00066447	What's life like as a Bighorn rancher?
GID00066448	You look more than just too hot - what's the matter?
GID00066449	Then have, I don't know, some water or something.
GID00066450	I'd like to ask you some other questions.
GID00066451	Goodbye.
GID00066452	I have questions about you.
GID00066453	I'd like to ask you about the Wasteland.
GID00066454	Let's talk about Heck Gunderson.
GID00066455	What was that about settling a score?
GID00066456	Where do you come from?
GID00066457	I have news about the Gundersons
GID00066458	How do Wastelanders cope with current times?
GID00066459	Maybe Heck would listen to your pleas if his son's life was at stake.
GID00066460	Heck's life and a safe future have a steep price, Walter. 1000 caps' my fee.
GID00066461	Heck's life? That's big game, a 1000 caps.
GID00066462	I want to talk to you about our deal.
GID00066463	You're not from around here, are you?
GID00066464	Are you a Bighorn rancher?
GID00066465	What else can you tell me about Heck Gunderson?
GID00066466	Heck claims to be an honest rancher.
GID00066467	What do you plan to do about him?
GID00066468	Heck's looking for his disappeared son. I've agreed to find him.
GID00066469	I may be able to help you.
GID00066470	I'll find out for you but not cheaply - 400 caps.
GID00066471	Okay, I'll be back when I find out more about him.
GID00066472	The best don't come cheap, Walter. 400 caps' my fee.
GID00066473	Actually, let me consider it first.
GID00066474	Okay, I'll be back when I find out more about him.
GID00066475	Actually, let me consider it first.
GID00066476	Okay, I'll be back when I find out more about him.
GID00066477	Actually, let me consider it first.
GID00066478	How is Heck a threat to other ranchers in The Wasteland?
GID00066479	I'll take care of them.
GID00066480	Heck's a powerful man - I'd need extra for his son's life, 500 caps.
GID00066481	500 and Ted's history.
GID00066482	I'm not interested right now. Sorry, Walter.
GID00066483	Actually, never mind. Let me ask you about something else.
GID00066484	Tell me again about your home.
GID00066485	What's being a Bighorn rancher like?
GID00066486	It turns out that Ted Gunderson's disappeared. Heck's looking for him.
GID00066488	Ted's a goner.
GID00066489	You don't have to worry about Heck Gunderson, ever again.
GID00066490	Consider it done.
GID00066491	Consider it done.
GID00066492	Consider it done.
GID00066493	Consider it done.
GID00066494	Consider it done.
GID00066495	Let's talk prices.
GID00066496	You might like to know that Heck's barely protected, right now.
GID00066497	We said 1000 for Heck, right?
GID00066498	Heck for 500, correct?
GID00066499	Ted's worth 500 to you, then?
GID00066500	So, 250 for Ted it is?
GID00066501	The Gundersons are history.
GID00066502	I have news about the Gundersons
GID00066503	Goodbye.
GID00066504	Ethel's right, vengeance will only lead to more innocents' deaths.
GID00066505	None but...huh, what right do you have?
GID00066506	You are just giving them the excuse they need.
GID00066507	You are right. Let's deal with them.
GID00066508	Goodbye.
GID00066509	I'm not interested about this right now.
GID00066510	I was wondering if you had any work available.
GID00066511	I was wondering if you had any work available.
GID00066512	Is that guard position still available?
GID00066513	Still need that sample delivered?
GID00066514	I delivered the package as requested.
GID00066515	Sure. Count me in.
GID00066516	Sorry, I have better things to do.
GID00066517	Mind if I ask you some questions?
GID00066518	So is this a family business?
GID00066519	What do you sell?
GID00066520	This seems like a bad neighborhood to open a store.
GID00066521	Tell me about Freeside.
GID00066522	Tell me about yourself.
GID00066523	Always.
GID00066524	Maybe another time.
GID00066525	Keep talking.
GID00066526	I'll do it.
GID00066527	I'm not a delivery boy. Not interested.
GID00066528	He said you'd hear from them soon.
GID00066529	What do you know about this client?
GID00066530	They seemed pleased, and said they'd be in touch.
GID00066531	Absolutely.
GID00066532	What would I have to do?
GID00066533	I'm busy now.
GID00066534	That's right.
GID00066535	How did you know?
GID00066536	Looks like we're stuck with each other.
GID00066537	Laser.
GID00066538	Plasma.
GID00066539	What's the difference?
GID00066540	I have. It's a slum.
GID00066541	Yes, what of it?
GID00066542	No, I haven't.
GID00066543	Maybe? I go lots of places. Can't remember them all, you know.
GID00066544	Sure, I'll look into it.
GID00066545	I think I'll pass.
GID00066546	If I can't just kill him, what did you want me to do?
GID00066547	What was I supposed to do again?
GID00066548	I've heard that there's bad blood between Pacer and the Van Graff family.
GID00066549	Pacer's addicted to Jet, even though he has a heart condition.
GID00066550	Add a little Psycho to his Jet, and he'd have a heart attack.
GID00066551	Maybe the jet will cause his heart to give out.
GID00066552	I was hoping you'd know.
GID00066553	I'm not an assassin.
GID00066554	All right, I'll try to find a way.
GID00066555	What's my other choice?
GID00066556	Let's start with my reward.
GID00066557	When you put it that way... yes.
GID00066558	I suppose not.
GID00066559	You wanted a man dead. He's dead. Now where are my caps?
GID00066560	I'm sorry. I screwed up.
GID00066561	Wow, you're really mad.
GID00066562	I discovered that Pacer and the Van Graffs have a troubled history.
GID00066563	I discovered that Pacer is a Jet addict and has a heart condition.
GID00066564	I used an energy weapon to kill Pacer, so the Van Graffs should take the blame.
GID00066565	I risked my neck out there. Couldn't you spare a little more?
GID00066566	That's it?
GID00066567	I laced Pacer's Jet with Psycho and it didn't go well for him.
GID00066568	The King complied with Colonel Moore's ultimatum.
GID00066569	Glad to be of service.
GID00066570	Keep me in mind for any future assignments.
GID00066571	I spoke to the King, and he promised to stop the violence against NCR citizens.
GID00066572	The King won't deal with the NCR.
GID00066573	I'm still working on it.
GID00066574	Sounds like you and the Colonel don't get along.
GID00066575	That'll show the people in Freeside who's in charge!
GID00066576	Sending NCR soldiers into Freeside would be a bad idea.
GID00066577	So what do you suggest?
GID00066578	I guess I'll head over to Colonel Moore, then.
GID00066579	But you've got another idea. Spit it out.
GID00066580	The Kings were all killed after the King turned down the ultimatum.
GID00066581	The King accepted Colonel Hsu's offer of help.
GID00066582	A fight broke out when I presented Hsu's offer. The Kings are all dead.
GID00066583	I think I'd rather go with the assassination plan.
GID00066584	Add a little Psycho to his Jet, and he'd have a heart attack.
GID00066585	Maybe the jet will cause his heart to give out.
GID00066586	I was hoping you'd know.
GID00066587	I received my orders from Colonel Moore, and am still carrying them out.
GID00066588	Tell me more about the King.
GID00066589	What would I need to do?
GID00066590	Guess I'll go have a talk with the King, then.
GID00066591	I received my orders from Colonel Hsu, and am still carrying them out.
GID00066592	I haven't talked to either Colonel Moore or Colonel Hsu yet.
GID00066595	Major Polatli said you might need some help.
GID00066596	I wanted to talk to you about your missing medical supplies.
GID00066597	I finished looking over your patients.
GID00066598	Yes. I have some medical experience.
GID00066599	<Lie> You betcha!
GID00066600	No, not really.
GID00066601	Yes. Private Stone was stealing them.
GID00066602	No, not yet.
GID00066603	<Lie> I wasn't able to find out anything.
GID00066604	I'm not qualified to examine your patients.
GID00066608	I did what I could for your patients.
GID00066609	I've studied lots of medicology.
GID00066610	How're things around camp?
GID00066611	I have some questions for you.
GID00066612	Things look pretty rough in here.
GID00066613	It looks like you have a decent facility here.
GID00066614	You seem to be handling it well.
GID00066615	This place looks more like a chop shop.
GID00066616	What makes you think someone is stealing your supplies?
GID00066617	Perhaps you've misplaced them?
GID00066618	Maybe you're just careless.
GID00066619	It wasn't me.
GID00066620	I can look into this for you.
GID00066621	What exactly is missing?
GID00066622	Where do you keep your supplies?
GID00066623	When did you notice them missing?
GID00066624	I can't help you right now.
GID00066625	I want to talk about something else.
GID00066626	Major Polatli sent me to help you out.
GID00066627	How're things around the camp?
GID00066628	I found the supplies you were looking for.
GID00066629	Speaking of supplies... I found some nearby, are they yours?
GID00066630	Tell me about yourself.
GID00066631	About that thing you wanted...
GID00066632	I'm always willing to give a helping hand.
GID00066633	It depends on what sort of thing.
GID00066634	Uh, no thanks, maybe later.
GID00066635	I found some NCR dogtags.
GID00066636	Seems easy enough.
GID00066637	I wanted to ask about your missing men.
GID00066638	The situation looks pretty bad here.
GID00066639	Quit complaining, it's not that bad here.
GID00066640	How can I help with your supply problems?
GID00066641	Any idea on where I should start looking?
GID00066642	This sounds pretty dangerous.
GID00066643	I'd like to ask about something else.
GID00066644	Goodbye.
GID00066645	Do you know anything about Dr. Richards' missing medical supplies?
GID00066646	What do you need help with?
GID00066647	I could do that for you.
GID00066648	I don't have time for this.
GID00066649	Do you have the troops to retake Nelson?
GID00066650	What do you want me to do now?
GID00066651	Is there any intel on the Legion forces at Nelson?
GID00066652	I've helped Quartermaster Mayes get some supplies.
GID00066653	I've finished helping Dr. Richards.
GID00066654	I'm ready. Let's do it!
GID00066655	I'll need some time to prepare.
GID00066656	I want to talk about the attack on Nelson.
GID00066657	Do you know anything about Dr. Richards' missing medical supplies?
GID00066658	What's your problem?
GID00066659	How are things around camp?
GID00066660	Alright, hand it over.
GID00066661	Not interested.
GID00066662	Dilated eyes, increased heart rate... I think you took the drugs.
GID00066663	You look a little sick. Maybe you should see Dr. Richards.
GID00066664	Nevermind. I'll just turn you in instead.
GID00066665	I saw you stealing the supplies.
GID00066666	Okay. Thanks anyway.
GID00066667	This better be good.
GID00066668	I don't care about your explanations.
GID00066669	Doing drugs isn't going to change anything.
GID00066670	What about the injured men that need this medicine?
GID00066671	Hum... I think I understand.
GID00066672	That's a poor excuse.
GID00066673	I'm going to turn you in.
GID00066674	I want you to turn yourself in.
GID00066675	I won't turn you in... if you make it worth my while.
GID00066676	If you promise to stop, I won't turn you in.
GID00066677	Because it's the right thing to do.
GID00066678	Keep it to yourself, but Hanlon is the one behind the misinformation. He's got a plan.
GID00066679	Excuse me?
GID00066680	Watch your mouth, ghoul, or I might just rip your jaw off.
GID00066681	Whoa, why the hostility?
GID00066682	I have no idea what you're talking about.
GID00066683	That's what your mom said last night. Aw yeah. I went there.
GID00066684	Why bother? You're embarassing yourself enough as it is.
GID00066685	Afraid not.
GID00066686	No, but if there's money in it, I could be.
GID00066687	Thanks, but that's not why I'm here.
GID00066688	I can't think of a more pathetic career choice.
GID00066689	Not yet. I'm still working on it.
GID00066690	He's agreed to let you out of your contract. You can go work at the Tops now.
GID00066692	Do you have time for a few questions?
GID00066693	What's the trouble with the Legion?
GID00066694	Snakes are small. Why don't you just use a gun or whatever to shoot them?
GID00066695	Legion?
GID00066696	Nelson?
GID00066697	Why?
GID00066698	If you want to make a go at it, I'll come along.
GID00066699	So you perform stand-up comedy, huh?
GID00066700	Are you, like, an actor or something?
GID00066701	So who are you, exactly?
GID00066702	Tommy Torini is hiring new acts at the Tops. I think you could make good money.
GID00066703	Tommy Torini is hiring at the Tops. I don't get your jokes, but maybe you could make money.
GID00066704	Are you sure you wouldn't rather go work at the Tops?
GID00066705	Garrett's agreed to let you out of your contract. You can go work at the Tops.
GID00066706	Goodbye.
GID00066707	Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
GID00066708	I just have a few questions.
GID00066709	How long have you been doing comedy?
GID00066710	Tommy Torini at the Tops is hiring entertainers. I could put in a word for you.
GID00066711	Have you reconsidered asking for a better price from Tommy?
GID00066712	But we're standing on a street corner in the middle of nowhere.
GID00066713	It's very impressive.
GID00066714	So you're looking for your big break?
GID00066715	With jokes like that, no wonder you're working the street.
GID00066716	Don't sell yourself short. You're worth a lot more than that.
GID00066717	No, you've got to start high! Ask for a million and go from there!
GID00066718	Sure, here's his card.
GID00066719	That's your call. Here's his card.
GID00066720	Look, just hang out here for a bit, I want to make sure you get a deal.
GID00066721	Tommy wants a profit, he won't pay you what you're worth unless you ask for it.
GID00066722	Hang on, this comes out to 1,500 caps for Billy! He's worth three times that!
GID00066723	Thanks.
GID00066724	Hang on, this comes out to 1,500 caps for Billy! He's worth three times that!
GID00066725	Thanks.
GID00066726	I want to talk to you about how much you're paying Billy Knight.
GID00066727	Billy's worth three times what you're paying him.
GID00066728	Why would this Mr. Bishop be after you?
GID00066729	Why did you come all the way out here from New Reno?
GID00066730	Interested in working for the Garrets?
GID00066731	Well, that was... different.
GID00066732	No, you performed as intended.
GID00066733	Report to the Atomic Wrangler. James Garret is your new owner.
GID00066734	I can't feel my legs!
GID00066735	I would like to purchase your services.
GID00066736	<Pay 10 caps>
GID00066737	Maybe later.
GID00066738	Woohoo! <assume the position>
GID00066739	Never mind, I would like a refund.
GID00066740	I found the sexbot you're looking for.
GID00066741	Fisto is already programmed to respond to your commands.
GID00066742	<Speech>
GID00066743	Thing is, Fisto's a *heavy-duty* piece of equipment, built to last...
GID00066744	First I'd like to discuss payment. This wasn't a cakewalk.
GID00066745	I need double before we talk more.
GID00066746	<Barter>
GID00066747	Thing is, Fisto's a *heavy-duty* piece of equipment, built to last...
GID00066748	Thing is, Fisto's a *heavy-duty* piece of equipment, built to last...
GID00066749	Seems like... maybe a robot would be worth more? You think?
GID00066750	Let's talk about something else.
GID00066751	Are you part of the Legion?
GID00066752	Is it dangerous to trade with the Legion?
GID00066753	Do you ever trade with the NCR?
GID00066754	Goodbye.
GID00066755	I have some questions about you.
GID00066756	How long have you been a slave?
GID00066757	Let's talk about something else.
GID00066758	Where are you from?
GID00066761	What do you do here?
GID00066762	No, I don't. What makes you think that?
GID00066763	<Lie> Yeah, I do, and it's time for you to suffer!
GID00066764	Can't say that I have.
GID00066765	You robbed a casino boss?
GID00066766	And so because of that you ran all the way to Novac?
GID00066767	Let's talk about something else.
GID00066768	Wow. My hat is off to you, that takes some balls.
GID00066769	You really don't know when to quit, do you?
GID00066770	That's a tough break. Good luck with that.
GID00066771	I'll let you know if I find any work for a singer.
GID00066772	Tommy Torini at the Tops is looking for musical acts, if you're interested.
GID00066773	I spoke to Clanden, and I couldn't get anything out of him.
GID00066774	I found these tapes in Clanden's room, can you verify this is him?
GID00066775	Cachino sent me to talk to you.
GID00066776	What kind of business do you do here?
GID00066777	I'll show it to you for 100 caps.
GID00066778	What do you do around here?
GID00066779	So you're a bounty hunter?
GID00066780	That is a mouthful. Let's shorten that to Fisto.
GID00066781	What?! No!
GID00066782	My pleasure is for you to work at the Atomic Wrangler.
GID00066783	I suppose I should test you out before I hand you to the Garrets...
GID00066784	Report to the Atomic Wrangler. James Garret is your new owner.
GID00066785	I need one too. Here, next round's on me.
GID00066786	As good a place as any - though here you are drinking yourself *under* ground.
GID00066787	Looks like you could use a friendly ear right now. What's up?
GID00066788	I want to ask you some questions.
GID00066789	Goodbye.
GID00066790	Keep up the attitude soon you'll be on the ground, for good.
GID00066791	No game. I offered to keep an eye out for talented acts, is all.
GID00066792	Tommy offered me a recruiting fee.
GID00066793	Here, take his card. Tell him I sent you.
GID00066794	If I give you his card, what's in it for me?
GID00066795	I'm giving you a real opportunity here - how about some compensation?
GID00066796	On second thought, I don't think you're the right fit after all.
GID00066797	Have you been playing long?
GID00066798	When did your father leave?
GID00066799	Let's talk about something else.
GID00066800	Nevertheless, I'm interested.
GID00066801	Oh, okay then, never mind.
GID00066802	Your father abandoned you?
GID00066803	Smart guy. Families just tie you down.
GID00066804	Wait, Montana? You wouldn't happen to be 17, would you?
GID00066805	Oh thank God. Forget it. Never mind. So your father left?
GID00066806	No reason. Well, uh, say, let's talk about something else.
GID00066807	Sounds like you miss him. Is that why you're out here wandering?
GID00066808	I'm sure he had a reason for leaving.
GID00066809	Let's change the subject.
GID00066810	It must have been hard growing up without a father.
GID00066811	You were better off without him. You became your own man, outside of his shadow.
GID00066812	And what will you do when you find him?
GID00066813	He sounds like a scumbag. You should make him pay.
GID00066814	Sounds like you should move on. Settle down, maybe.
GID00066815	Yeah, he's probably dead anyways. You should just get a life.
GID00066816	Can't say that I do, sorry.
GID00066818	What kind of help do you need?
GID00066819	Tell me about the plan.
GID00066820	Let's talk about something else
GID00066821	I don't have any more questions right now.
GID00066822	I helped Troike out, like you asked.
GID00066823	I finished that work for Clanden.
GID00066824	I'm all done with that work you needed.
GID00066825	What was Cachino's role in the plan?
GID00066826	What do you do around here?
GID00066827	How did you end up with one of the hotel suites?
GID00066828	The Bosses sent me to offer you assistance.
GID00066829	What do you need the bombs for?
GID00066830	How can I be of assistance?
GID00066831	A gas, perhaps chlorine? It is a deadly nerve gas and not too hard to come by.
GID00066832	Er... Maybe you could build a nuke?
GID00066833	What did you have in mind?
GID00066834	I have a couple other questions to ask you instead.
GID00066835	Let's talk about this a little later.
GID00066836	Where can I find some chlorine gas?
GID00066837	I don't think I want to get involved in this.
GID00066838	I found some chlorine for you.
GID00066839	Your bosses sent me to you to see if you needed any help with your work for them.
GID00066840	Tell me about the problem with the last shipment.
GID00066841	How are you getting the weapons into the strip?
GID00066842	Why do you work for the Omertas?
GID00066843	Do you mean these weapon parts?
GID00066844	I'll keep an eye out for them.
GID00066845	I have a couple more questions.
GID00066846	I want to ask about something else.
GID00066847	That's all I have for questions right now.
GID00066848	I found those weapon parts you needed.
GID00066849	Are you trying to kill your customers?
GID00066850	I'm looking to make some carbon tetrachloride for fire suppression.
GID00066851	I... Um... Need it to make chlorophyll for plants...
GID00066852	Actually, I was curious if you sell chlorine to The Ultra-Luxe.
GID00066855	I want you to attack enemies the moment you see them.
GID00066856	<Aggression Level::Aggressive>
GID00066857	<Aggression Level::Aggressive>
GID00066858	I want you not to attack enemies unless I've already engaged them.
GID00066859	<Aggression Level::Passive>
GID00066861	What do you mean by Family?
GID00066862	What is Zoara?
GID00066863	I have business with your bosses.
GID00066864	Nevermind, I'm done now.
GID00066865	One of your soldiers has been breaking family rules, here is the proof.
GID00066866	My business with the bosses is my business, not yours.
GID00066867	It involves Cachino, and if you don't let me through it'll involve you too.
GID00066868	What I have is for their eyes only, not some lowly thug.
GID00066869	I have proof one of your Lieutenants is dealing behind your back.
GID00066870	Is it worth 100 caps to you?
GID00066871	I'll give it to you for 200 caps.
GID00066872	I'll give you the journal for... um... 5% of Gomorrah's earnings.
GID00066873	This will be worth your while, so much that you won't regret paying 300 caps for it.
GID00066874	You give me 4500 caps and I'll let you look at the proof I found.
GID00066875	I wanted to ask you another question first.
GID00066876	Actually I have some other business to take care of.
GID00066877	How is Cachino going to be handled?
GID00066878	Cachino mentioned you had something big planned.
GID00066879	I have more questions about your plans.
GID00066880	Why didn't you intervene sooner when Benny ambushed me?
GID00066881	What use would you have for a protege?
GID00066882	Why did Benny betray you?
GID00066883	Let's talk about something else.
GID00066884	I have a right to know more.
GID00066885	If the Chip's so valuable, why use a single courier to transport it?
GID00066886	Let's talk about something else.
GID00066887	Why don't you send your robots into the Tops to arrest Benny?
GID00066888	What happens if the Platinum Chip is never lost?
GID00066889	Isn't that overstating things a bit?
GID00066890	How do I get to Benny?
GID00066891	Say I want to take a diplomatic approach.
GID00066892	Any ideas on how I could catch him off-guard?
GID00066893	The Chairmen are your employees. Don't they take orders?
GID00066894	Let's talk about something else.
GID00066895	I have a few questions before I decide.
GID00066896	Are Marilyn and Jane your... girlfriends?
GID00066897	Why can't you be the one to tell Swank?
GID00066898	How did you establish New Vegas?
GID00066899	Where did the Three Families come from?
GID00066900	Let's talk about something else.
GID00066901	Let's talk about something else.
GID00066902	I'll accept your original offer.
GID00066903	Not interested. Sorry.
GID00066904	What's the matter with you?
GID00066905	Easy, there. Down boy.
GID00066906	Your discount was a lie.
GID00066907	I'm going to kill you now.
GID00066908	<Speech>
GID00066909	<Glare> You should give me this code for free while you can still walk straight.
GID00066910	Give it to me for free, now!
GID00066911	<Speech>
GID00066912	50 caps without even knowing the details of this code? How about 25?
GID00066913	25 caps, take it or leave it.
GID00066914	Now you need to settle that debt with the Garrets.
GID00066915	Thanks, but I'm still going to kill you.
GID00066916	Goodbye, and I better not hear about you trying this crap again.
GID00066917	<Speech>
GID00066918	Santiago, dealing with you is getting to be more annoying than it is worth.
GID00066919	Santiago, dealing with you is getting to be more annoying than it is worth.
GID00066920	Hey, you made me look like a fool!
GID00066921	Who's supplying you?
GID00066922	Do you have any work you need done?
GID00066923	What sort of "proclivities" are we talking about?
GID00066924	Maybe later.
GID00066925	I'll see if I run across any suitable candidates.
GID00066926	I'm not going to be your pimp.
GID00066927	I'll expect 100 caps *minimum* for each candidate I bring in.
GID00066928	I'll see what I can do.
GID00066929	What did you need again?
GID00066930	Sorry, not interested.
GID00066931	<Speech>
GID00066932	Surely these escorts are critical to your business? How about double?
GID00066933	Ha! Who are you kidding! I need double!
GID00066934	<Barter>
GID00066935	I will need more than that to recoup travel expenses.
GID00066936	That's chimp pay!
GID00066937	Thank you. You've been very helpful.
GID00066938	Let's talk about something else.
GID00066939	Santiago says the password is extravaganza for a discount.
GID00066940	I don't have much on me.
GID00066941	I'm new in town, and wanted to pay my respects.
GID00066942	Trust me, the King will want to see me.
GID00066943	All right. I'm on it.
GID00066944	Not quite yet.
GID00066945	I've bugged the tower for you.
GID00066946	I could retrieve the caps from your caravan.
GID00066947	I've dealt with such things in the past.
GID00066948	Rodents of unusual size? I don't believe they exist.
GID00066949	<Barter>
GID00066950	I find it hard to believe you ran from the caravan without taking something.
GID00066951	Lady, you've got to have extra stuff on you somewhere.
GID00066952	<Perception>
GID00066953	Jane, I can tell you're lying through your teeth.
GID00066954	<Lady Killer>
GID00066955	Jane, surely a lady of your stature has honor sufficient to pay her debts.
GID00066956	Yeah, I would like that.
GID00066957	I changed my mind. Let me ask you about something else.
GID00066958	A prank you say?
GID00066959	That doesn't sound like a good idea.
GID00066960	Shall we get down to business?
GID00066961	Shall we get down to business, then?
GID00066962	What are you talking about? I'm just a courier.
GID00066963	Shall we get down to business?
GID00066964	I think I'll be on my way.
GID00066965	Why the VIP treatment? I'm just a courier.
GID00066966	I think I'll be leaving.
GID00066967	I think I'll be leaving.
GID00066968	Let's get down to business, then.
GID00066969	Not interested. I'll see myself out.
GID00066970	I'm still working on getting you fixed.
GID00066971	The King said you could tell me more about his robotic dog.
GID00066972	So you can't heal him?
GID00066973	The King brought him here for treatment then?
GID00066974	So there's no chance he'll ever get better?
GID00066975	Is there anyone who could do all that?
GID00066976	What are you doing here?
GID00066977	This place looks amazing. Where do I start?
GID00066978	Point me to The Tops, Victor. I've got a score to settle.
GID00066979	Not now, Victor - I'm busy.
GID00066980	Why is a robot passing on his invitation?
GID00066981	All right, I'll go there straight off.
GID00066982	Tell Mr. House I might stop by. We'll see.
GID00066983	No thanks. I can handle myself just fine.
GID00066984	What is the Platinum Chip?
GID00066985	How's the Chip work?
GID00066986	What does the Chip do?
GID00066987	What are you offering?
GID00066988	The hows don't matter.
GID00066989	You left quite a trail. <Show Benny his cigarette butt and lighter.>
GID00066990	You left these at my grave.<Show Benny his cigarette butts.>
GID00066991	Seems you dropped something in Boulder City. <Show Benny his lighter.>
GID00066992	I've got questions - a bunch of them.
GID00066993	What's the deal with your secret workshop and "Yes Man" friend?
GID00066994	First things first. Tell me about the Platinum Chip.
GID00066995	No deal. Time to die.
GID00066996	Let's talk about the Platinum Chip.
GID00066997	I want to know about the factions gunning for Vegas.
GID00066998	The Chip belongs to me. Hand it over.
GID00066999	It's a deal.
GID00067000	I want to know about the factions gunning for Vegas.
GID00067001	What is this scheme of yours, Benny?
GID00067002	And you're willing to commit murder to make this happen?
GID00067003	You're right, murder is the answer. Yours. <Attack Benny.>
GID00067004	I see your point.
GID00067005	The ruthlessness of others is no excuse.
GID00067006	If you're thinking we can work together, let's hear your offer.
GID00067007	What's your offer?
GID00067008	What's your plan?
GID00067009	What makes you think you can succeed?
GID00067010	Let's talk about something else.
GID00067011	Answers first, then I decide.
GID00067012	If you're thinking we can work together, let's hear your offer.
GID00067013	Tell me about Mr. House.
GID00067014	What makes the Chairmen so special?
GID00067015	Fill me in about the NCR.
GID00067016	Tell me about Caesar's Legion.
GID00067017	Tell me why you used Great Khans.
GID00067018	Like I'd trust you? No thanks.
GID00067019	Help me understand this scheme of yours.
GID00067020	What are you offering?
GID00067021	Forget it, I forgive you.
GID00067022	No deal. Time for you to die. <Attack Benny>
GID00067023	What makes you think you can succeed?
GID00067024	I dug myself out of that grave to put you in yours, Benny.
GID00067025	What do you think of the Omertas?
GID00067026	What do you know about the White Glove Society?
GID00067027	I need a key to Cachino's room. Do you have one that will work?
GID00067028	Thanks, but I'll find another way.
GID00067029	Ok, 300 caps is a deal.
GID00067030	How about 200 caps and I forget we ever met.
GID00067031	How about 200 caps and I forget we ever met.
GID00067032	Free sounds better to me.
GID00067033	<Lie>Troike wants to see about negotiation some lower prices for weapons for you guys.
GID00067034	Um... I'm sure you have enough guns.
GID00067035	Troike is pretty strung out. He'll be more trouble than he is worth.
GID00067036	Well I'm sure he's be a very productive worker, he could use some vacation time.
GID00067037	He seems pretty tired.
GID00067038	You should buy guns from Mick and Ralph, people are starting to ask questions.
GID00067039	Mick and Ralph would...Um... Enjoy selling the Omertas guns.
GID00067040	You should buy guns from Mick and Ralph, people are starting to ask questions.
GID00067041	Mick and Ralph would...Um... Enjoy selling the Omertas guns.
GID00067042	Mick and Ralph are curious why you stopped buying guns from them.
GID00067043	No idea.
GID00067044	I hear you lost some guns.
GID00067045	Time to die, Sal.
GID00067046	Cachino! Shoot now.
GID00067047	Troike is on his way to destroy the guns for me.
GID00067048	Troike destroyed the guns for me.
GID00067049	I destroyed all the guns.
GID00067050	Troike gave me some Thermite to destroy the guns.
GID00067051	Clanden has been arrested.
GID00067052	Clanden is leaving Gomorrah and won't be back.
GID00067053	Clanden is dead.
GID00067054	I have some questions about the Bosses plans.
GID00067055	What's the next step in breaking up the bosses plans?
GID00067056	What's the next step in breaking up the bosses plans?
GID00067057	Why do they need to die?
GID00067058	How do we take care of the bosses?
GID00067059	What happens when the bosses are gone?
GID00067060	They are going to expect something from me, you can do it and surprise them.
GID00067061	I'm not a very good shot, you should kill them.
GID00067062	Let's go take care of the bosses.
GID00067063	I'm not ready to take out the bosses yet.
GID00067064	Big Sal agreed to let you go.
GID00067065	Let's talk about something else.
GID00067066	What can you tell me about Hoover Dam?
GID00067067	Is there anything you can tell me about the Great Khans?
GID00067068	Where can I find McCarran?
GID00067069	The President is coming to Hoover Dam?
GID00067070	What happened to Boulder City?
GID00067071	<Speech>
GID00067072	Bill, Julie and the rest of your friends miss you. They need your help.
GID00067073	Harden the hell up, Bill. You're being a sissy!
GID00067074	<Science>
GID00067075	A combination of Fixer, Psycho, and Buffout would do it in one shot.
GID00067076	Fixer is for pansies!
GID00067077	<Science>
GID00067078	Regulating decreasing doses of booze with a couple shots of Fixer should do it.
GID00067079	Just stick your fingers down your throat. That'll flush you real good.
GID00067080	I'd like to talk about something else.
GID00067081	Could you repair some things for me?
GID00067082	Hey you only fired three shots and there are four guys there...
GID00067083	Something about this doesn't seem right...
GID00067084	Why did you run ahead like that?
GID00067085	Let's keep moving.
GID00067086	Or, you just faked this whole thing to drum up repeat business.
GID00067087	After you.
GID00067088	I want all the money you have on you. I could make it to the Kings from here.
GID00067089	You should give me all your money. Or I'll tell. And stuff.
GID00067090	I think I already killed him...
GID00067091	Orris left town after I had a little talk with him.
GID00067092	Why do you want to know?
GID00067093	Yes.
GID00067094	And this is where I come in.
GID00067095	What would you like to know?
GID00067096	Shame that you can't fix Boomer suits. They're very similar to vault suits.
GID00067097	I'll also bring you Boomer suits. You can fix them and sell them.
GID00067098	Shame that you can't fix Boomer suits. They're very similar to vault suits.
GID00067099	I'll also bring you Boomer suits. You can fix them and sell them.
GID00067100	Shame that you can't fix Boomer suits. They're very similar to vault suits.
GID00067101	I'll also bring you Boomer suits. You can fix them and sell them.
GID00067102	Okay. You got it.
GID00067117	I haven't had a chance to look yet.
GID00067118	Benny has reprogrammed a Securitron, he's trying to take over the Strip.
GID00067119	I thought maybe I'd talk to the man. See if we can work out a deal.
GID00067120	I'm not sure yet, but I had some other questions first.
GID00067121	Goodbye.
GID00067125	Just passing through.
GID00067126	<Lie> Water main burst upstairs. They sent me down to survey the damage.
GID00067127	<Lie> Mortimer sent me to move the kid. Thinks one of his own might betray him.
GID00067128	<Lie> Uh... I'm supposed to release the prisoner. Good behavior I guess.
GID00067129	<Lie> I'm... er... a building inspector. Surprise inspection!
GID00067130	[Attack] Trespassing.
GID00067131	Why is everyone around here dressed up and wearing masks?
GID00067132	Where is your mask?
GID00067133	Let me ask you about something else.
GID00067134	What can you tell me about your organization?
GID00067135	Where did you say the investigator's room was, again?
GID00067142	I need more film for the camera
GID00067143	You have my attention, go on.
GID00067144	You have the wrong person.
GID00067145	Reyes' information says otherwise.
GID00067146	That's not what Reyes said.
GID00067147	Maybe you're lying to keep morale up.
GID00067148	What do you do out here?
GID00067149	Goodbye.
GID00067150	Hanlon was the one sending out the false reports. He killed himself rather than turning himself in.
GID00067151	<Lie> Yes, everything's resolved - Hanlon and I found a Legion spy at Camp Golf.
GID00067162	I found proof of your blackmail.
GID00067163	I have a couple more questions about the guns.
GID00067164	How do you get the guns into the strip?
GID00067165	Give me the Thermite and I'll destroy the weapons.
GID00067166	Let's talk about something else.
GID00067167	That's it for now.
GID00067168	Where do the guns come from?
GID00067169	If you don't deploy the Thermite yourself, I'll tell the bosses what you've been planning.
GID00067170	You deploy the Thermite or I'll punch you in the shoulder.
GID00067171	What is Thermite?
GID00067172	What can we do to take care of the guns?
GID00067173	I have some more questions about the Thermite.
GID00067174	Tell Benny you're going to kill him.
GID00067175	We talk here and now, or I tell everyone my story.
GID00067176	I didn't come here to negotiate, I came for revenge. <Attack Benny.>
GID00067177	You're a little bitch and your brother was, too.
GID00067178	What is this memorial?
GID00067179	Goodbye.
GID00067180	I'm sorry to hear that.
GID00067181	< Speech Option - 30 >
GID00067182	My apologies. It was rude and disrespectful of me to do that.
GID00067183	Sorry. I, uh, didn't know what I was doing.
GID00067184	Where are you normally stationed?
GID00067185	Yeah, whatever.
GID00067187	This doesn't interest me. I should be leaving.
GID00067188	Here you go. <Give the Platinum Chip to Mr. House.>
GID00067189	I have some questions to ask first...
GID00067190	I'd like to see what you have for sale.
GID00067191	I'm just browsing.
GID00067192	Two hundred caps! That's twice what everyone else is charging!
GID00067193	Will it be dangerous? I like dangerous.
GID00067194	I'm listening.
GID00067195	Sure.
GID00067196	I'm a little busy right now.
GID00067197	Vault gear - swell. Can you show me what you got?
GID00067198	Sarah, stop right there. Do you actually have any vault gear?
GID00067199	I'll help you out.
GID00067200	I might be persuaded to lend a hand.
GID00067201	Yeah. I wanted to ask you about something else before my top blows... off, too.
GID00067202	You know, leather is my specialty. Unzip it, heat it and rub a shine onto it.
GID00067203	Wait a moment - I changed my mind. Let me ask you something else.
GID00067204	Quit yapping. I am starting to think of very unpleasant uses for those toasters.
GID00067205	Actually, let me ask you about something else.
GID00067206	Thinking about you in tight leather makes me want to uh... blow my top?
GID00067207	All right. Consider it done.
GID00067208	Maybe later. I have more questions for you.
GID00067209	All right. Consider it done.
GID00067210	Maybe later. I have more questions for you.
GID00067211	Don't say anything then - you look good enough just nodding your head.
GID00067212	Maybe later. I have more questions for you.
GID00067213	Do you still need more vault stuff?
GID00067214	Yeah, I heard that before. What about actual vault gear?
GID00067215	What is so special about this vault?
GID00067216	You have never actually left this place?
GID00067217	Sarah - there is something else behind all this, right?
GID00067218	Sheldon also likes the indoors... a lot. Are you agoraphobic too?
GID00067219	Something doesn't add up, Sarah. This can't be all that.
GID00067220	Why did he fill the vault with concrete?
GID00067221	What does Mr. House have to do with Vault 21?
GID00067222	You run the place, then?
GID00067223	Sure. I would like that.
GID00067224	Do you get a lot of business here?
GID00067225	Do you miss the old days in the vault?
GID00067226	I had other questions for you.
GID00067227	Just don't say "Here, now!" Don't want to get the patrons all riled up, do we?
GID00067228	Count on it.
GID00067229	I still have some questions about Vault 21.
GID00067230	I have some more questions about Vault 21
GID00067231	I would like to know other things about you and this hotel.
GID00067232	What did you say about not being the owner of the hotel and shop?
GID00067233	<Securitron Dialog>
GID00067234	Let's see what you've been hiding under that checked suit. <Have sex with Benny.>
GID00067235	Let's see what's under that checked suit. <Have sex with Benny>
GID00067236	Keep your pants on. I've got questions that need answers.
GID00067237	You fell for this trap hook, line, and sinker. <Attack Benny.>
GID00067238	Ask Benny about himself and his situation.
GID00067239	What a prize you are. Not interested.
GID00067240	What are you offering?
GID00067241	What'd you have in mind?
GID00067242	Fine, but don't keep me waiting.
GID00067243	Use Barter to get Benny to advance you a stack of casino chips.
GID00067244	The suite's a nice touch, but someone's got to pay off my contract.
GID00067245	If you want me to play nice, it'll cost you.
GID00067246	If you want me to play nice, it'll cost you.
GID00067247	Decline Benny's offer and say you'll expose him.
GID00067248	Tell Benny you're going to kill him.
GID00067249	Player uses SPEECH to convince Benny to accompany him immediately.
GID00067250	Two conditions - lose the bodyguards, and we both go to the suite now.
GID00067251	Why don't you, you know... help me find where the suite is?
GID00067252	You're right. I want answers.
GID00067253	All I want is to see you dead. <Attack Benny.>
GID00067254	Player says goodbye.
GID00067255	You're stinking up my suite, Benny. Scram. We'll talk later.
GID00067256	Goodbye.
GID00067257	I led you on, and it worked like a charm. Bye bye.
GID00067258	What about you?
GID00067259	What do you want me to do?
GID00067260	What's my help worth to you?
GID00067261	I'll need at least two thousand caps to motivate me.
GID00067262	Goodbye.
GID00067263	I'm looking for the Ambassador.
GID00067264	What can you tell me about the Embassy?
GID00067265	Tell me about yourself.
GID00067266	What's happening on the Strip?
GID00067267	Tell me about yourself.
GID00067268	What do you know about the Ambassador?
GID00067269	What can you tell me about Captain Pappas?
GID00067270	What is happening on the Strip?
GID00067271	I'd like to know more about you.
GID00067272	What can you tell me about the Ambassador?
GID00067273	Tell me about Private Erwin.
GID00067274	Here, Benny - special delivery. <Punch Benny in the face.>
GID00067275	Seems you need to work on your marksmanship.
GID00067276	I dug myself out of that grave to plant you in yours, Benny. <Attack.>
GID00067277	I want the Platinum Chip and I want it now.
GID00067278	[Black Widow] and options.
GID00067279	When you shot me, you ran off so fast I never got your name.
GID00067280	Is it wrong to want a guy who'd shoot me in the head?
GID00067281	Girls like bad boys. And you've been downright awful.
GID00067282	I'm saying I dig you, despite it all. What do you say?
GID00067283	I'm a courier, remember? Don't you want me to handle your package?
GID00067284	You stole my package. Let's see what I can do with yours.
GID00067286	Tell Benny he'd better tell you why he shot you and left you for dead NOW.
GID00067287	Give me one good reason not to kill you.
GID00067288	What's the story with your secret workshop and "Yes Man" friend?
GID00067289	Tell Benny to give you the Chip.
GID00067290	I'm wondering why I shouldn't just kill you.
GID00067291	I dug myself out of that grave to plant you in yours, Benny.
GID00067292	What's the story with your secret workshop and "Yes Man" friend?
GID00067293	Where can I find Cachino?
GID00067294	<Black Widow/Lady's Man Options>
GID00067295	A gorgeous lady like you has to know where I can find Cachino.
GID00067296	I be a sexy lady like you could tell me where I could find someone named Cachino.
GID00067297	If I told you you have a beautiful body, would you tell me where Cachino is?
GID00067298	A handsome man like you has to know where I can find Cachino.
GID00067299	Listen here shitwad, tell me where I can find Cachino.
GID00067300	I'd like to talk to you about Troike.
GID00067301	What kind of business do you do here?
GID00067302	Actually, I'd like to see about getting him out of his obligations to you.
GID00067303	Something about his story doesn't sit right with me.
GID00067304	On second thought, let's talk about something else.
GID00067305	Um, nevermind. Sorry I said something.
GID00067306	What do you do here?
GID00067307	So what's your story?
GID00067308	Do you know where the knife came from?
GID00067309	Cachino sent me to ask you about some guns.
GID00067310	Okay, so what can you tell me about the guns the Omertas have?
GID00067311	Tell me what happened with the prostitute.
GID00067312	Tell me what happened with the prostitute.
GID00067313	What kind of chems were you doing?
GID00067314	How did the family find out about it?
GID00067315	That seems like a lot of chems.
GID00067316	<Medicine Options>
GID00067317	That doesn't sound like enough to get you to lose the whole night.
GID00067318	Um... Wouldn't that make your heart explode or something?
GID00067319	I have a couple more questions about what happened that night.
GID00067320	Let's talk about something else.
GID00067321	That's it for now.
GID00067322	Would you like me to try to get you out of your contract?
GID00067323	I'm looking to help Cachino break up whatever the Bosses are planning.
GID00067324	Maybe I can help you out of your contract with the family.
GID00067325	<Speech Option>
GID00067326	<Lie> If you don't help me, I'll report your work here to NCR.
GID00067327	Tell me what you know or I'll, um... break your nose.
GID00067328	<Speech Option 2, low skill>
GID00067329	Cachino forgot to tell me what they have on you.
GID00067330	Err... I know what they have on you... Well I know, but I forgot. Tell me again.
GID00067331	I don't have that on me right now.
GID00067332	Sorry, Bill, but I still don't have the meds yet.
GID00067333	I want to help you get well, Jacob.
GID00067334	Goodbye.
GID00067335	Julie Farkas says you could use some help.
GID00067336	You look pretty bad, Jacob. You should probably stop using chems.
GID00067337	I took care of that dealer. Now you can clean up.
GID00067338	I helped with that addiction problem you mentioned.
GID00067339	You said you could spare some supplies?
GID00067340	A stimpak.
GID00067341	Fixer.
GID00067342	RadAway.
GID00067343	Credit check? What's that for?
GID00067344	I'll submit to the credit check. <2,000 caps required.>
GID00067345	[Passport] I've got a passport.
GID00067346	<Science>
GID00067347	1C 3C R34 M.
GID00067348	1C 3C R34 M.
GID00067349	Robot! Let me past!
GID00067350	What do I need to do to get in?
GID00067351	Do you always charge people to come talk to you?
GID00067352	I was hoping you might have some work for me.
GID00067353	What do you need me to do?
GID00067354	Here you go, 10 caps.
GID00067355	Actually, I don't have enough caps right now.
GID00067356	Actually, I don't have enough for that right now.
GID00067357	You said that Vault 21 wasn't always a hotel?
GID00067358	I would like to hear again about the items you sell here.
GID00067359	<VMS23 Note Dialog>
GID00067360	Thank you, Victor.
GID00067361	I've never seen anything like this place.
GID00067362	A city devoted to vice and sin - what's not to love?
GID00067363	I prefer the wasteland, to be honest.
GID00067364	Can we get down to business?
GID00067365	Why the VIP treatment? I'm just a courier.
GID00067366	Suggest talking about Benny.
GID00067367	Suggest getting down to business.
GID00067368	Use [Speech to press Mr. House about the Chip.]
GID00067369	Let's get down to business, then.
GID00067370	Agree with House that you're important.
GID00067371	What's your story, Mr. House?
GID00067372	What are your plans for New Vegas?
GID00067373	How do you intend to enforce your claim on the city?
GID00067374	Wasn't the NCR's army big enough to defeat your Securitrons and the Three Families?
GID00067375	What were the terms of your treaty with the NCR?
GID00067376	You would go to war against the NCR?
GID00067377	Say you keep control of New Vegas. What happens next?
GID00067378	In the meantime, you'd rule Vegas as some kind of dictator?
GID00067379	What's to keep you from abusing your power?
GID00067380	What do you propose?
GID00067381	Yes, let's get down to business.
GID00067382	I'd like to ask some questions.
GID00067383	This doesn't interest me. I should be leaving.
GID00067384	What are you proposing?
GID00067385	I have some questions to ask first.
GID00067386	1000 caps? I accept your terms.
GID00067387	What terms are you offering?
GID00067388	Tell me your terms again?
GID00067389	Tell me about Benny.
GID00067390	No thanks.
GID00067391	[Barter] for better terms.
GID00067392	It's a good start... but well below market price.
GID00067393	Raise your price or... or, uh... you're "chip outta luck."
GID00067394	What is the Platinum Chip?
GID00067395	Ask about the Chip. (Recovered)
GID00067396	What was your relationship with Benny... back when he was breathing?
GID00067397	Who exactly are you, Mr. House?
GID00067398	How do I get to Benny?
GID00067399	1250 caps? I accept your terms.
GID00067400	Tell me about the factions vying for New Vegas.
GID00067401	The Chip is worth far more than that.
GID00067402	Use [Speech] to press Mr. House about the Chip.
GID00067403	The more I know about the Chip, the easier I can find it...
GID00067404	The less I know, the less I care. Know what I mean?
GID00067405	You appear to be a computer, not a man.
GID00067406	Use Medicine skill to surmise House's condition.
GID00067407	The lifespan you're claiming is impossible, except for ghouls and super mutants.
GID00067408	You must be, like... a brain in a jar!
GID00067409	How have you stayed alive all this time?
GID00067410	Change the subject.
GID00067411	All right, I'll do it.
GID00067412	Still not interested.
GID00067413	I'll return when I have the Chip.
GID00067414	Yes, I have some questions I want to ask.
GID00067415	Maybe. I have some questions I want to ask.
GID00067416	No thanks, not interested.
GID00067417	I'll recover the Chip.
GID00067418	What were your terms again?
GID00067419	I have some questions to ask first.
GID00067420	No, I'm still not interested.
GID00067421	I need to ask some questions before I recover the Chip.
GID00067422	Never mind. Goodbye.
GID00067423	I've changed my mind.
GID00067424	Tell me about Boulder City.
GID00067425	What's the concrete used for?
GID00067426	Not quite. When I kill you, however, the job will get done right.
GID00067427	Never mind. Let's talk about something else.
GID00067428	Actually, never mind. Stealth is more my style.
GID00067429	All right. Get ready to cover me once I've freed them.
GID00067430	I think I'd rather try negotiations, instead.
GID00067431	I may be able to negotiate a deal with the Great Khans.
GID00067432	I could sneak in there and try to get your people out.
GID00067433	I understand.
GID00067434	Don't worry about me. I can handle myself in a fight.
GID00067435	Whatever.
GID00067436	What are you going to do about the hostages?
GID00067437	I'm unable to work out a deal. The Great Khans are all yours.
GID00067438	Julie Farkas sent me to help you sober up.
GID00067439	Why don't you stop drinking?
GID00067440	How can you afford so much alcohol?
GID00067441	You won't be seeing Dixon anymore.
GID00067442	You need to kick the habit, Bill. I can help you.
GID00067443	What do you need?
GID00067444	Bill, I've got what you asked for.
GID00067445	Well, I've got that right here.
GID00067446	I'm here to collect, McCaffery. No one crosses the Garret Twins.
GID00067447	Give me a share of the caps and your hat and you can go free.
GID00067448	Nah, just thought I'd say hi.
GID00067449	I guess I haven't got a choice but to put you away.
GID00067450	<Speech>
GID00067451	All I need is your hat, and you're a free man. I'll tell Francine you're dead.
GID00067452	Hand over your hat before I pump you full of hot lead, you old fart!
GID00067453	Goodbye.
GID00067454	Francine warned me that you're a smooth-talker.
GID00067455	VIP? The Garrets said nothing about VIP status.
GID00067456	50 Caps is a bit steep, but okay. Here, now what is it?
GID00067457	<Barter down 25 caps>
GID00067458	I don't even know this discount is worth 50. How about 25 caps?
GID00067459	What kind of moron would pay 50 caps for information? 25 caps.
GID00067460	Santiago is dead if he doesn't cough up what he owes the Garrets.
GID00067461	Liar. Pay up.
GID00067462	<Punch Santiago in the face> I won't ask again, Santiago.
GID00067463	<Speech>
GID00067464	I'd rather not kill you, but Francine put a bounty on your head.
GID00067465	I'm going to... Well, I'm sure it will be very painful if you don't pay.
GID00067466	<Barter>
GID00067467	With a price on your head, you should be paying me to say you're dead.
GID00067468	You need to pay me to pay the Garrets right now.
GID00067469	I can collect from your corpse, if you prefer.
GID00067470	Are you the Grecks who owes the Garrets?
GID00067471	Collecting money to pay back the Garrets?
GID00067472	Sure, man. Here you go. <Punch Grecks in the face>
GID00067473	Your hangman, if you don't start being straight with me.
GID00067474	You owe the Garrets a good lump of caps. I'm here to collect.
GID00067475	There is more where that came from if you don't pay your debt.
GID00067476	Cough em up, Grecks.
GID00067477	<Press for extra caps>
GID00067478	You don't cheat the Garrets and walk away. Cough up the rest or you're rat bait.
GID00067479	You cheapass zombie. You need to pay my extra fee.
GID00067480	That'll do. Mess with the Garrets again and you're dead.
GID00067481	Thanks for the caps, now enjoy the zombie afterlife.
GID00067482	<Press for clothing>
GID00067483	Heh, I think I'll make an example of you. Give me your clothes, or you get dead.
GID00067484	You cheapass zombie. You need to pay my extra fee.
GID00067485	Sheesh, you're one ugly sonofabitch!
GID00067486	Yeah, and your eye! That shit is hilarious!
GID00067487	Seriously zombie, are you looking at me or someone off that direction?!
GID00067488	Nevermind. You owe the Garrets a good lump of caps.
GID00067489	Oh, by the way. That damn eye of yours is creepy. Get it checked out.
GID00067490	Heh. Whatever. Mess with the Garrets again and you're a dead man.
GID00067491	I was hired by the Garrets to track you down.
GID00067492	<Speech>
GID00067493	Perhaps there is something else of value you could put toward the debt?
GID00067494	I bet you've got some extra caps hidden in that dress somewhere.
GID00067495	Just give me what you have on you and they might accept it knowing you're dead.
GID00067496	But then, I'd be a liar, and I hate liars. <Attack>
GID00067497	I suppose that might work. It'll take some convincing though.
GID00067498	You owe the Garrets a bunch of caps.
GID00067499	Do you give supplies to the Locals, too?
GID00067500	Why are you doing this for us?
GID00067501	One of the victims confirmed his attacker was an NCR officer.
GID00067502	I should be going.
GID00067503	I think I have all of the debts collected.
GID00067504	<Barter>
GID00067505	This kind of work costs time and money. 50/50 would cover my expenses.
GID00067506	Are you crazy?! I'll be walking all over the place looking for these people.
GID00067507	How am I supposed to get to the Strip?
GID00067508	If I see McCaffery on the Strip, I'll be sure to take care of him.
GID00067509	I have some other business to handle, maybe later.
GID00067510	I took care of McCaffery.
GID00067511	Right here. <Give McCaffery's hat>
GID00067512	The Followers are looking to trade for supplies.
GID00067513	Do you know anything about Bill or Jacob?
GID00067514	I need you to stop supplying Bill and Jacob.
GID00067515	Maybe some caps could persuade you to leave them alone?
GID00067516	<Attack>
GID00067517	<Attack> Screw that. It'd be a lot cheaper and easier for me to kill you.
GID00067518	All right. Take the caps and leave them alone.
GID00067519	<Speech>
GID00067520	So the NCR is supplying you with cheap chems? To keep Freeside down?
GID00067521	If you don't leave them alone... I'll... I'll tell on you!
GID00067522	Nevermind. I don't have enough to cover that.
GID00067523	The Followers need to find someone to trade with for supplies.
GID00067524	I might be able to work something out.
GID00067525	Do you have anything for sale?
GID00067526	I spoke with Julie Farkas. She says the Followers will accept your offer.
GID00067527	How's business?
GID00067528	I think I found someone who will be able to cover your supplies.
GID00067529	The Garret Twins.
GID00067530	You get your chems and can help anyone who gets addicted.
GID00067531	With a surplus of supplies, you could use your caps and influence to expand.
GID00067532	You said something about helping addicts?
GID00067533	Tell me about Bill Ronte.
GID00067534	Tell me about Jacob.
GID00067535	If I wanted to calm things down in Freeside, where would I start?
GID00067536	Where should I start looking?
GID00067537	Things seem pretty rough here in Freeside.
GID00067538	Is there anything I can do to help?
GID00067539	I'll see what I can do to help them.
GID00067540	Hope.
GID00067541	I don't know.
GID00067542	You know anything about NCR soldiers prowling the area?
GID00067543	You still have some info on those NCR soldiers that have been about?
GID00067544	You drive a hard bargain. Here you go.
GID00067545	If you ever want me to buy another tip from you, that price'll come down.
GID00067546	How about 15 caps since we both know you need the money?
GID00067547	Done.
GID00067548	Sorry, too rich for me.
GID00067549	Do you know the password?
GID00067550	I've already paid good money for this information. A hundred more caps, no more.
GID00067551	You want even more money? Are you insane?
GID00067552	Fine.
GID00067553	Here you go.
GID00067554	Thanks, I'll go check it out.
GID00067555	Sorry, too rich for me.
GID00067556	Heard anything about the password at the train station?
GID00067557	The NCR is distributing supplies in a building down by the old train station.
GID00067558	Where did you get the robot dog?
GID00067559	Is there something wrong with him?
GID00067560	He doesn't seem very happy.
GID00067561	Let's talk about something else.
GID00067562	What can you tell me about Freeside?
GID00067563	Tell me about the Kings.
GID00067564	Can they do anything?
GID00067565	Is he going to be okay?
GID00067566	Can I help somehow?
GID00067567	Absolutely. I'll see that he gets better.
GID00067568	I'll pass.
GID00067569	About Rex here...
GID00067570	Let's talk about something else.
GID00067571	A magazine on locksmiths?
GID00067572	What are the bobby pins for?
GID00067573	And the bobby pins?
GID00067574	And this magazine - "Locksmith's Reader?"
GID00067575	All right. I'll go take a look at that safe when I have a chance.
GID00067576	Actually, I already cracked that safe.
GID00067577	I would like a room, please.
GID00067578	A vault hotel? Was it like this before the war?
GID00067579	What kinds of things do you sell in this gift shop?
GID00067580	Are you the owner of this hotel and shop?
GID00067581	Let's see what you have for sale.
GID00067582	I would like to ask you some questions about Vault 21.
GID00067583	There are some things I wanted to know about you.
GID00067584	I have Vault gear for you.
GID00067585	Okay. 20 caps sounds good.
GID00067586	On second thought, I don't need a room right now.
GID00067587	Sarah, I plan on staying here often - got a special price for a special client?
GID00067588	20 caps for a crappy rat-hole? C'mon, you can do better than that.
GID00067589	Goodbye.
GID00067617	What do you think of Caesar's Legion?
GID00067618	On second thought, let's talk about something else.
GID00067623	Ted's father is a wealthy man. With his resources, this should be easy to stop.
GID00067624	The wine is ready to be brought out.
GID00067625	Time to serve the meal.
GID00067626	Never mind.
GID00067627	It was Mortimer, one of the White Gloves, who had Ted taken. He's a cannibal.
GID00067628	<Lie> I don't know who took him. I just found him.
GID00067629	You can blame the White Glove Society. They're all cannibals.
GID00067630	Your son is confused. He doesn't know what he's saying.
GID00067631	Let's not be hasty. You don't have to punish the entire Strip.
GID00067632	That's just what they'd want. You'd be driving the city to eat each other.
GID00067633	That sounds like a fantastic idea.
GID00067634	But, but, but... that's so unfair. You should only punish the man who did it.
GID00067635	Actually, the White Glove Society is responsible. They're all cannibals.
GID00067636	I want to join the White Glove Society. I was told I'd need a sponsor.
GID00067637	Would you be willing to sponsor me as an honorary member now?
GID00067638	<Loudly> Bad news, Mortimer. No one's eating the boy you kidnapped tonight.
GID00067639	I'm looking for the Gourmand. Am I in the right place?
GID00067640	Sorry, Mortimer. Secret recipe. It isn't human, though, I can tell you that.
GID00067641	[Attack] You all heard his confession! The punishment for cannibalism is death!
GID00067642	Too late, Mortimer. You already said too much.
GID00067643	Yes, sir.
GID00067644	I think you may have me confused with someone else.
GID00067645	Who do you think you are, talking to me that way?
GID00067646	I'll go back to my job now.
GID00067647	[Attack] You'll be feeding birds when I'm through with you.
GID00067648	<Lie> Oh no, you have it right. I'm a server.
GID00067649	<Lie> I'm here to talk business. Interested in putting out a cookbook?
GID00067650	Hey, could I, uh, buy some of your recipes?
GID00067651	You're screwed up in the head.
GID00067652	Your predisposition towards anger suggests unresolved issues in your past.
GID00067653	I'm a new honorary member of the White Glove Society.
GID00067654	That's right. I don't work for you.
GID00067655	You may be projecting. Tell me more about your parents.
GID00067656	What about the banquet?
GID00067657	You go do that, then.
GID00067658	I was just wondering where I could find tonight's wines.
GID00067659	[Attack] I just stopped by to kill you.
GID00067660	It'll be huge. I'll advance you a hundred caps, plus half the gross.
GID00067661	Yes. We're a major publisher. But as a sign of good faith I'll need recipes.
GID00067662	Uh... how about you give me your recipes and then we'll see.
GID00067663	I'll advance you a hundred caps and then... wait, I don't have that much on me.
GID00067664	My mistake. Let's discuss other things.
GID00067665	I think I saw a radroach in the pantry. You should check it out.
GID00067666	Would you, uh, go step in the pantry for a minute?
GID00067667	Calm down. I've come to get you out of here.
GID00067668	There's no time to explain. We have to go now.
GID00067669	Some members of the White Glove Society. They were going to eat you.
GID00067670	<Lie> I don't know who did this.
GID00067671	The White Glove Society isn't to blame. Just Mortimer and a few others.
GID00067672	You should have them all killed. It would serve them right.
GID00067673	You're right. Let's make sure they're all killed.
GID00067674	I could always leave you here if you aren't going to listen.
GID00067675	[Attack] Doesn't matter. I'm going to finish what they started.
GID00067676	[Attack] He'll never know, because I'm going to kill you.
GID00067677	It's not my problem. I don't care what you do.
GID00067678	Thanks for the food.
GID00067679	Are you with the NCR military?
GID00067680	Tell me about yourself, Ambassador.
GID00067681	I'd like to know more about the NCR.
GID00067682	Uh... no word yet. I'll get back to you on it.
GID00067683	No deal.
GID00067684	What's happening around the Strip?
GID00067685	I don't think it's going to work out. Sorry.
GID00067687	I'm listening.
GID00067688	Sorry, I'm not interested.
GID00067689	Actually, I already know them. We're good friends.
GID00067690	I've met with the Boomers. I don't think it'll work out.
GID00067691	I know where they are. I'll go and talk to them.
GID00067692	I'll find them and talk to them.
GID00067693	About that thing you wanted to talk about, let's hear it.
GID00067694	The Boomers have agreed to help me.
GID00067695	Yes... they will help... "us."
GID00067696	Uh... I'm not sure. I'll get back to you.
GID00067697	That's enough history for me.
GID00067698	Go on.
GID00067699	Interesting, go on.
GID00067700	I'd like to ask about something else instead.
GID00067701	What do you do out here?
GID00067702	What is this place?
GID00067703	Sure, I'll keep an eye out.
GID00067704	Talent scouting isn't really my thing. I think I'll pass.
GID00067705	Yeah, I hear you. Any idea where he goes when he disappears like that?
GID00067706	So, Benny likes to take off, huh? Uhh, want to tell me where he goes?
GID00067707	Let's talk about something else.
GID00067708	Okay, sorry, I didn't mean anything by it.
GID00067709	Really? What kind of entertainment do you have?
GID00067710	Maybe I could help you find some more acts for your show.
GID00067711	I've reconsidered about the talent scouting.
GID00067712	Sounds great.
GID00067713	Make it 5% and you've got a deal.
GID00067714	No way, I won't do it for less than 50%!
GID00067715	What's Benny planning to do with the Chip?
GID00067716	What was Benny planning to do with the Chip?
GID00067717	Benny stole a Platinum Chip from me. Do you know what it's for?
GID00067718	Have you seen this Platinum Chip before?
GID00067719	Benny reprogrammed a Securitron? All by himself?
GID00067720	What is this place?
GID00067721	"Yes Man?" What kind of a name is that?
GID00067722	Shouldn't you be working for Mr. House? How'd you end up here?
GID00067723	You're very... forthcoming with that information.
GID00067724	Can that actually be done?
GID00067725	On second thought, never mind.
GID00067726	What do you think about Benny?
GID00067727	What do you do here?
GID00067728	What other entertainment is there on the Strip?
GID00067729	Let's talk about the acts I recruited.
GID00067730	Tell me about this theater.
GID00067731	Swank mentioned you might be looking for some new acts. Can I help?
GID00067732	Yeah, let's have some fun.
GID00067733	Deal.
GID00067734	No thanks.
GID00067735	Actually I'm looking for someone named Cachino.
GID00067736	Nothing, I was just leaving.
GID00067737	Is this journal worth 100 caps to you?
GID00067738	Ok, 100 caps and you help me break up whatever your bosses have planned.
GID00067739	Do you think the Family would like to see this?
GID00067740	I think I'm going to keep this for a little while.
GID00067741	<Barter Option>
GID00067742	I'll consider giving this to you, for some cash up front.
GID00067743	Err... Well if you give me everything you have, I'll consider making a deal.
GID00067744	Why don't you try and take it from me?
GID00067745	What kind of specialist is Clanden?
GID00067746	Clanden has been handled already.
GID00067747	Tell me about this Troike.
GID00067748	Do you know anything about what they are planning?
GID00067749	That's all the questions I have for now. I may have more later.
GID00067750	I have a couple more questions.
GID00067751	<Lie> I didn't have a choice - they started shooting first.
GID00067752	Like you said, things went bad.
GID00067753	That was me, "negotiating."
GID00067754	He did. And anything you could tell me about what happened might help.
GID00067755	Why else would I be here asking questions?
GID00067756	Not really.
GID00067757	Every bit helps. Thanks.
GID00067758	The King asked me to look into your attack.
GID00067759	What can you tell me about the attack?
GID00067760	Do you remember anything about the people who attacked you?
GID00067761	I have to get going.
GID00067762	Why do I need a bodyguard crossing Freeside?
GID00067763	How much for your services?
GID00067764	What if I'm not going to the south gate?
GID00067765	I don't think I need your services. Sorry.
GID00067766	Okay, I'll hire you.
GID00067767	The King said you could set me up with a pass to the Strip.
GID00067768	Thanks, I'd like to buy some stuff before I head out.
GID00067769	See you later, Ralph.
GID00067770	Goodbye.
GID00067771	<Speech>
GID00067772	A resourceful fellow such as yourself must have something on the side.
GID00067773	Let me in on the action!
GID00067774	Ah, now I see why you want to keep this low key.
GID00067775	Too steep for my blood. Maybe later.
GID00067776	Okay, I'll take one.
GID00067777	<Pay 500 caps> Okay, I'll take one.
GID00067778	<Pay 375 caps> Okay, I'll take one.
GID00067779	I've already got enough caps to pass the credit check.
GID00067780	No way your materials and expenses require that. How about half?
GID00067781	I'd like to buy a passport.
GID00067782	500 caps.
GID00067783	It's not worth mentioning.
GID00067784	Nothing, I talked my way in.
GID00067785	I'm looking for a way into the Strip.
GID00067786	I've been sent by the NCR to end the violence against their citizens.
GID00067787	I figured you might have some work for me.
GID00067788	Sure. What do I have to do?
GID00067789	Not really. I guess I'll go find another way.
GID00067790	Yes.
GID00067791	Sure, I've got one waiting outside for me.
GID00067792	No, I must have missed them.
GID00067793	Sure.
GID00067794	Why are you so interested in this?
GID00067795	Why can't your men look into this?
GID00067796	I have better things to do.
GID00067797	Orris is a fraud. He fakes attacks on his clients and then plays hero.
GID00067798	Not much. He seemed legit to me.
GID00067799	Orris shouldn't be a problem any longer.
GID00067808	Look, I found these cigarette butts by the grave he buried me in.
GID00067809	I found this lighter in Boulder City. He dropped it when he killed his partners.
GID00067810	Here, take a look at this note I found in Novac.
GID00067811	What's the story with the White Glove Society?
GID00067812	Look, just trust me on this, okay?
GID00067813	That's it. What do you think?
GID00067814	Okay, I'll do it.
GID00067815	Actually, never mind. It's nothing.
GID00067816	We don't have time for that. We need to take him out right now.
GID00067817	I don't think you're going to like it. Seems Benny's been making his own play.
GID00067818	Uh, well, you know Benny's planning to screw you over, right?
GID00067819	Ha ha! Take it easy, pal, I'm just pulling your leg. Honest.
GID00067820	Go ahead, see if I care.
GID00067821	Benny tried to kill me and stole a platinum chip I was hired to deliver.
GID00067822	Benny stole my chip! And he tried to kill me, Mr. House said so!
GID00067823	He tried to make it look like an accident - just a traveler killed and robbed in the Wasteland.
GID00067824	Benny's going to steal all of House's robots! Don't you see?
GID00067825	Benny must think this chip will allow him to seize power on the Strip.
GID00067826	Let's talk about the Omertas.
GID00067827	What do you know about Mr. House?
GID00067828	Tell me about the Chairmen.
GID00067829	Flattering, but I don't like being tied down. How about some real work?
GID00067830	Baby, you're too good to me! How about some caps to buy myself something pretty?
GID00067831	I've got more questions about New Vegas.
GID00067832	Let's talk about something else.
GID00067833	Not yet. Soon.
GID00067834	Yeah, he's dead.
GID00067835	He bolted. But I'll find him.
GID00067836	They took my guns at the security checkpoint. Can you set me up?
GID00067837	Okay, I'll do it.
GID00067838	Not yet, I want to take care of a few things first.
GID00067839	Yeah, send him up to his room. I'll take care of him.
GID00067840	Yeah. Keep him distracted while I search his room.
GID00067841	You first.
GID00067842	I'm looking for someone who went missing.
GID00067843	Just someone who found a matchbook.
GID00067844	He's dead.
GID00067845	<Lie> He couldn't make it, so he sent me instead.
GID00067846	You don't want to know.
GID00067847	I found the matchbook on a body in a hotel room.
GID00067848	No. I'm trying to find a different missing person and ran across the man's body.
GID00067849	[Attack] I am now.
GID00067850	Who are you afraid of?
GID00067851	What were you supposed to discuss here?
GID00067852	So is Mortimer behind the disappearances?
GID00067853	How do you know what happened to the girl?
GID00067854	What about Ted Gunderson?
GID00067855	Wouldn't they punish Mortimer for the deception?
GID00067856	Where are they keeping Ted?
GID00067857	Any suggestions on how to get Ted out?
GID00067858	Okay. Game's over. Now pay up or I'll break your bones one by one, little man!
GID00067859	You lived in Vault 21? Tell me about that.
GID00067860	I guess you're having trouble with Mr. House requests. What's the problem?
GID00067861	An artist - rare thing to see. What's your story?
GID00067862	(Lie) You really believed I wasn't working for Mr. House? Chump.
GID00067863	Lets see... You've got that thingy... there. Power, uh, re-circulators here....
GID00067864	Better cough up some caps or Mr. House finds about your sorry excuses.
GID00067865	Relax. I was just kidding. What's all this fretting about Mr. House?
GID00067866	Have you seen the cost of pliers, duct-tape and saws lately? 300 caps.
GID00067867	Artists are scarce. I bet you get paid handsomely. Cough up 300 caps.
GID00067868	Oh, so you've got lots of caps on you? Then I guess I can just beat them out of you.
GID00067869	(Lie) So, uh, wasn't it clever how I tricked you? I'm... working for Mr. House!
GID00067870	All right. 150 caps will do.
GID00067871	300 caps it is.
GID00067872	Why do you have a problem with Mr. House's requests?
GID00067873	You exhibit clear symptoms of acute agoraphobia. I can help.
GID00067874	Oh, that's, uh, I have it at the tip of my tongue... Agomorrahphobia! I'll help.
GID00067875	So, is this fear of the outside world draining your inspiration?
GID00067876	It sounds as if you don't like this place. What is wrong with it?
GID00067877	Why don't you pack up and return to Vault 21?
GID00067878	You seem to dread hearing about Mr. House's requests. What is the problem?
GID00067879	Relax. I was just kidding.
GID00067880	Have you seen the cost of pliers, duct-tape and saws lately? 300 caps.
GID00067881	Artists are scarce. I bet you get paid handsomely. Cough up 300 caps.
GID00067882	Several years of psychoanalysis, and a few thousand caps a month, will fix you.
GID00067883	I know this guy in Freeside, really good at trepanation. You'd be amazed how h-.
GID00067884	Grow a pair and go out into the real world to find your inspiration!
GID00067885	I could escort you into the wasteland. It's not so bad.
GID00067886	What do you mean?
GID00067887	I'll help you. Do you have any landmarks in mind?
GID00067888	Mickey, photography is a risky business. This is going to cost you. A lot.
GID00067889	You know, I'm tired of this. I think I'll just beat you senseless instead.
GID00067890	Ok, you've got a deal. I'll return with the pictures.
GID00067891	I have some fresh pictures for you.
GID00067892	I'm glad we have an understanding. Now, do you have any landmarks in mind?
GID00067893	You're not making this easy. Screw it. Hand over the caps or drop dead.
GID00067894	That's a very... inspired choice, Mickey.
GID00067895	Groveling brings out the worst in me. I'm going to enjoy this.
GID00067896	Tell me about you again.
GID00067897	You mentioned growing up in Vault 21. Can you tell me about that?
GID00067898	What's your story, Michael Angelo?
GID00067899	I have some ideas that may help with your agoraphobia problem.
GID00067900	What landmarks did you want me to photograph?
GID00067901	I took all the pictures you wanted. There was something about a reward...
GID00067902	All right. I'll bring you more next time. Good bye
GID00067903	All right. I'll bring you more next time. Good bye
GID00067904	All right. I'll bring you more next time. Good bye
GID00067905	All right. I'll bring you more next time. Good bye
GID00067906	Let's see. Walk half the world or rough you up right now... Mickey, you lose.
GID00067908	I've got evidence that Benny tried to kill me and stole a Platinum Chip from me.
GID00067909	I've got more evidence that proves Benny tried to kill me.
GID00067910	I think you should know something about Benny.
GID00067911	What do you know about the NCR?
GID00067912	Nice place you've got here. Tell me about it.
GID00067913	Can you give me the rundown on New Vegas?
GID00067914	The Omertas won't take kindly to hearing about your relationship with Joana.
GID00067915	I hear you've been doing some business on the side.
GID00067916	What can you tell me about Gomorrah?
GID00067917	I hear you've been dealing with some business that is off limits for the family.
GID00067918	I found this ledger that proves some of your side business.
GID00067919	I'd like to talk to you about your journal.
GID00067920	That's it for questions.
GID00067921	<Medicine Check - Bye Bye Love>
GID00067923	<Cachino Question 2>
GID00067924	<Cachino Question 3>
GID00067925	<Goodbye>
GID00067926	The Great Khans let the hostages go in exchange for their own freedom.
GID00067927	Go for it. The Great Khans have nowhere to run.
GID00067928	You're the officer here. Make the call.
GID00067929	Uh... am I in charge now? That can't be right.
GID00067930	What guns do you have for sale?
GID00067931	How's business?
GID00067932	What's the deal with the Omertas?
GID00067933	Let's talk about something else.
GID00067934	I think I figured out why the Omertas stopped buying.
GID00067935	They found a way to smuggle guns in at a lower price.
GID00067936	Good news. The Omertas say they'll buy arms from you again.
GID00067937	What do you have in stock?
GID00067938	Do you offer any other services?
GID00067939	Who is The King?
GID00067940	Nice place. Got a minute to talk?
GID00067941	Somehow I find that hard to believe.
GID00067943	I'd like to talk about you some more.
GID00067944	What's some fun going to run me?
GID00067945	<Ask Joana about herself, speech check>
GID00067946	What brought you here?
GID00067947	Do you like it here?
GID00067948	I'm still working on it.
GID00067949	I'm not a kid, old man.
GID00067950	I'd like to see what you have on tap.
GID00067951	I'm looking for a little R&R.
GID00067952	I'd like to help you with your debt collection.
GID00067953	I'd like a room.
GID00067954	[Give 10 caps] Here you go.
GID00067955	Nevermind, I changed my mind.
GID00067956	Couldn't we work out a deal?
GID00067957	Do you have any work you need done around here?
GID00067958	Will I have to shoot anyone? Because I really want to shoot someone.
GID00067959	That sounds good as long as I don't have to kill anyone.
GID00067960	What kind of caps are we talking here?
GID00067961	Eh, sorry. I've got some other things I need to handle first.
GID00067962	You've got yourself a deal.
GID00067963	<Speech more money>
GID00067964	Hey, I'm doing all of the work here. 50/50 and I'm game.
GID00067965	Twenty-five percent?! Fifty-fifty, or I walk.
GID00067966	Who's the King?
GID00067967	Yes, I'd like to see the King if possible.
GID00067968	Goodbye.
GID00067969	Here's 5 caps.
GID00067970	Here's 50 caps.
GID00067971	Is 500 caps enough?
GID00067972	Maybe I should be going.
GID00067973	50 caps.
GID00067974	You lost your son?
GID00067975	So you're a rancher?
GID00067976	Did you say something about a white glove?
GID00067977	What business did you have here at the hotel?
GID00067978	Never mind. I was mistaken.
GID00067979	He's over in the bathhouse, wearing a skimpy two-piece bathing suit.
GID00067980	Sorry. I didn't realize the situation was so serious.
GID00067981	I'm looking for someone who went missing here recently.
GID00067982	The White Glove Society used to eat human flesh?
GID00067983	Who did you talk to about the disappearance?
GID00067984	It's okay. I eat people too. You can tell me the truth.
GID00067985	<Lie> It's okay. I eat people too. You can tell me the truth.
GID00067986	Is there any way I could talk to the investigator?
GID00067987	Do you work here?
GID00067988	Heck Gunderson said he was here to talk business with you. What business?
GID00067989	Marjorie said you gave a free room to a private investigator.
GID00067990	Actually, I just need to speak with him.
GID00067991	<Lie> Yes, I have some critical information for him.
GID00067992	I'm on an investigation, too. I'm hoping we can help each other.
GID00067993	Anything going on around here?
GID00067994	What goods and services do you have to offer?
GID00067996	Any bounty hunting tips for me?
GID00067997	You need medical supplies?
GID00067998	What do you need?
GID00067999	You've got yourself a deal.
GID00068000	Maybe another time.
GID00068001	No, I haven't.
GID00068002	Could you be more specific? That could be a lot of people.
GID00068003	<Lie> Yes, I saw him here in the hotel.
GID00068005	Here's the money. It sounds like I could use a bodyguard.
GID00068006	I'd hire you, but I don't have the caps.
GID00068007	Here's the money. It sounds like I could use a bodyguard.
GID00068008	I'd hire you, but I don't have the caps.
GID00068009	Here's the money. It sounds like I could use a bodyguard.
GID00068010	I'd hire you, but I don't have the caps.
GID00068013	I don't really think I need a bodyguard.
GID00068014	I don't really think I need a bodyguard.
GID00068015	I don't really think I need a bodyguard.
GID00068017	Why would I need a bodyguard in Freeside?
GID00068018	Why would I need a bodyguard in Freeside?
GID00068019	Why would I need a bodyguard in Freeside?
GID00068020	Sorry, maybe another time.
GID00068021	Sure, here you go.
GID00068023	Are you soliciting me?
GID00068025	What kind of tip?
GID00068026	I'm not a trooper. I just happen to be wearing the armor.
GID00068027	Why is the Big Horn off limits to troopers?
GID00068028	But I already got a tattoo with your name on it. Want to see it?
GID00068029	You'd think the NCR would be very concerned about this sort of thing.
GID00068030	You think someone is listening in on your broadcasts?
GID00068031	Great, neither am I. Glad we cleared that up.
GID00068032	I think you're mistaking me for someone else.
GID00068033	I can't do this right now.
GID00068034	I ran out of ammo.
GID00068035	I wanted to ask you some questions.
GID00068037	These Great Khans might have something of mine - a Platinum Chip.
GID00068039	They'll be using explosives. Do you have something for more serious injuries?
GID00068040	The town is going to be attacked by bandits. Anything you can do to help?
GID00068041	Did my attackers say where they were going?
GID00068042	Why is that?
GID00068043	So where were they headed?
GID00068044	Powder gangers?
GID00068045	Some good you were. You didn't even show up to the fight.
GID00068046	They were here. The fight's over.
GID00068047	Didn't you hear all the gunfire?
GID00068048	Interesting. It looks like an override command was activated.
GID00068049	Override Command 16-Delta. Does that mean anything to you?
GID00068050	Figures. Someone shut you down deliberately, but there's no record of who.
GID00068051	Here are three Stimpaks.
GID00068052	You didn't exactly roll out a red carpet!
GID00068053	You mean you were expecting me? Like a prophecy or something?
GID00068054	Who is Mother Pearl?
GID00068055	I think I'll be leaving.
GID00068056	Are you going to confiscate my weapons?
GID00068057	I have to go.
GID00068058	Who are you?
GID00068060	<Watch Festus draw a card.>
GID00068061	<Watch Festus draw a card.>
GID00068062	<Watch Festus draw a card.>
GID00068063	<Watch Festus draw a card.>
GID00068064	<Watch Festus draw a card.>
GID00068065	<Watch Festus draw a card.>
GID00068066	<Watch Festus draw a card.>
GID00068067	<Watch Festus draw a card.>
GID00068068	<Watch Festus draw a card.>
GID00068069	<Press the blue button to draw a card.>
GID00068070	<Press the blue Draw button.>
GID00068071	<Press the blue Draw button.>
GID00068072	<Press the blue Draw button.>
GID00068073	<Press the blue Draw button.>
GID00068074	<Press the blue Draw button.>
GID00068075	<Press the blue Draw button.>
GID00068076	<Press the blue Draw button.>
GID00068077	<Press the blue Draw button.>
GID00068078	<Press the blue Draw button.>
GID00068079	<Press the red button to hold.>
GID00068080	<Press the red Hold button.>
GID00068081	<Press the red Hold button.>
GID00068082	<Press the red Hold button.>
GID00068084	I'm allowed to use the range?
GID00068085	You were the last one to check out the missing laser pistol, right?
GID00068086	So what happened?
GID00068087	I've got it right here.
GID00068090	Sorry, I haven't found it yet.
GID00068094	Okay, I'm in.
GID00068095	[END TUTORIAL] I think I've learned enough.
GID00068096	Sure, I'll come with you.
GID00068097	[END TUTORIAL] I've had enough of geckos for one day.
GID00068100	Didn't I hear you say something earlier about not being able to pay me now?
GID00068101	Is that the story you're going to stick with?
GID00068102	Staying because you want to or because you have to? This is a good hiding spot.
GID00068103	Thanks for the caps.
GID00068104	What does he actually do around here?
GID00068105	You don't like him?
GID00068106	Never mind. Let's talk about something else.
GID00068107	Never mind. I want to talk about something else.
GID00068108	How long has he been in Goodsprings?
GID00068109	I've never seen a robot like you before.
GID00068110	I repaired the solar arrays and increased their efficiency.
GID00068112	Is this some kind of joke?
GID00068114	Um, what? Is that it?
GID00068116	What the hell? Where's the real prize?
GID00068117	If you're so opposed to the NCR's expansion, why not do something about it?
GID00068119	Are you sure there's nothing I can do to help?
GID00068120	Yeah, you've been a real bundle of laughs.
GID00068121	I don't, sorry.
GID00068122	I'm afraid it's classified.
GID00068123	He was sabotaging the NCR's war efforts to force a retreat back to California.
GID00068124	Yes, it's true. I don't know why.
GID00068125	Yes, but it's a classified secret. Don't tell anybody.
GID00068126	Yes. He was sabotaging the Army to force the NCR to go home.
GID00068128	Isn't it customary for a doctor to prescribe follow-up medication?
GID00068129	My wounds still hurt a little. Can you give me something for the pain, Doc?
GID00068130	I'm in a *lot* of pain, Doc. Can you spare any more?
GID00068131	Don't I at least get a lollipop before leaving, Doc?
GID00068133	Tell me about yourself, Doc.
GID00068135	What else can you tell me about Goodsprings?
GID00068136	Could you give me the rundown on Goodsprings one more time?
GID00068137	What town is this?
GID00068139	Who was it that rescued me?
GID00068140	Do you know anything about the man that shot me?
GID00068141	Goodbye.
GID00068142	Seems a little light for the work I did.
GID00068143	If you insist.
GID00068144	Can you tell me anything about Goodsprings?
GID00068145	Tell me more about the Crimson Caravan Company.
GID00068146	Goodbye.
GID00068147	How did you happen to find me?
GID00068148	Do you know who those men were who attacked me?
GID00068149	How did you end up in Goodsprings?
GID00068150	I have wounds that need mending.
GID00068151	I need help with an addiction.
GID00068152	I'm suffering from radiation sickness.
GID00068153	All right. Here's three doses of Fixer.
GID00068154	No, thanks.
GID00068155	Here's two doses of Rad-Away.
GID00068156	No, thanks.
GID00068157	Here are two Stimpaks.
GID00068158	No, thanks.
GID00068159	Wager? Let's hear it.
GID00068160	300 caps? Too rich for my blood.
GID00068161	<Pay 300 caps> You've got yourself a bet.
GID00068162	<Barter>
GID00068163	300 caps? I'm a bit short right now. How about 200?
GID00068164	300 caps?! 50 sounds like a fair price.
GID00068165	<Speech>
GID00068166	You can tell me, or you can tell the underside of my boot.
GID00068167	Who the hell are you?
GID00068168	What was the deal again?
GID00068169	I believe you said you would double my money.
GID00068170	That was X caps.
GID00068171	That was 600 caps.
GID00068172	That was 400 caps.
GID00068173	<Lie> Make it 700 caps or I'll tell the Boomers to adjust their trajectory.
GID00068174	I think it deserves closer to 1000 caps.
GID00068175	I think it deserves closer to 1000 caps.
GID00068176	Yep, thanks for the compliment. Bye!
GID00068177	Not yet.
GID00068178	I have one right here.
GID00068179	<Science skill>
GID00068180	Corn silk, rubber hose, and removable adhesive would make a good hermetic seal.
GID00068181	Aw c'mon, it looks fine. I bet the seal will hold.
GID00068182	Let's talk about something else.
GID00068183	Goodbye.
GID00068184	I think I can handle a few ants without a sonic emitter.
GID00068185	I repaired the solar arrays.
GID00068186	I fixed the arrays and improved their efficiency a bit too.
GID00068187	Could you me tell the story of the mural again?
GID00068188	Goodbye.
GID00068189	Sure, I can spare the time.
GID00068190	Another time, maybe.
GID00068191	I'm surprised Nellis was empty when your people found it.
GID00068192	How do you survive, totally cut off from the world?
GID00068193	Why did your ancestors leave the safety of a vault?
GID00068194	What are howitzers doing at an Air Force Base?
GID00068195	How has Nellis taught your people to fly?
GID00068196	How did you learn where to find an old bomber?
GID00068197	That's enough history for now.
GID00068198	I'm looking to make myself useful. Who needs help around here?
GID00068199	Your people were willing to risk it all for freedom.
GID00068200	Yeah, any detonation with a yield of less than a half-ton of TNT is boring.
GID00068201	Yeah, I *love* it when I throw a grenade and it goes BANG!
GID00068202	You people are really crazy about blowing stuff up!
GID00068203	But a little radiation didn't keep your people away!
GID00068204	Whereas your people had brought Geiger counters with them from the vault.
GID00068205	But your people were mutants, immune to the radiation!
GID00068206	Kind of stupid, making a radioactive scrapheap your home.
GID00068207	The ingenuity of your people is remarkable.
GID00068208	You must cultivate soy or legumes for protein, in addition to grains.
GID00068209	But where do you get protein? Oh my god! You're all *cannibals!*
GID00068210	I guess poor nutrition could explain a lot of your behavior.
GID00068211	Your people are a determined bunch.
GID00068212	That howitzer battery is a monument to the grit and resolve of your people.
GID00068213	You folks would sell your souls for some artillery! You just love the stuff!
GID00068214	Yeah, you people are coo-koo for things that go boom.
GID00068215	Of course. You wouldn't want outsiders learning to fly.
GID00068216	Oh, to slip the surly bonds of Earth and dance amid the soaring birds...
GID00068217	Oh, to flap one's arms and plunge bird-like headlong and skybound...
GID00068218	Simulators, ha! That's a crash waiting to happen!
GID00068219	I look forward to seeing the old bomber fly.
GID00068220	You could attach ballast to the plane and then haul it here for repairs...
GID00068221	I guess you could start the engines underwater and hop it up onto shore...
GID00068222	Keep dreaming. That plane's never going to fly.
GID00068234	Get the troops lines up. I'll help you with it.
GID00068235	Don't worry, I'm not giving up. Let's try it again.
GID00068236	Okay, to start, pull the pin, let it cook off for a count of three, then throw.
GID00068237	Okay, count to three, throw the grenade, and pull the pin. Wait, no....
GID00068238	Don't pitch it like a baseball, lob it. You want a good, solid arc.
GID00068239	Now, um... really whip them downrange. Like you're throwing a fastball!
GID00068240	Don't worry about accuracy - use the grenades to break up clusters of enemies.
GID00068241	No, no, no! You have to *hit* the target with the grenade or it won't go off!
GID00068242	I think that went well, don't you?
GID00068243	Deal.
GID00068244	Never mind. I need to think about this.
GID00068245	You can't find Ringo yourself?
GID00068246	All right, I'll kill him for you.
GID00068247	All right. Here's two doses of Fixer.
GID00068248	Here's three doses of Rad-Away.
GID00068249	I have some missiles for you.
GID00068250	Anything else I can help out with?
GID00068251	Nice talking to you.
GID00068252	Will do.
GID00068253	I'm not sure if I'll be able to spare any, but I'll let you know.
GID00068254	I have 1 spare missile.
GID00068255	I have 5 spare missiles.
GID00068256	I have 10 spare missiles.
GID00068257	Sorry, I was mistaken. I don't have any extra missiles.
GID00068266	Take positions where you can cover each other. Stay focused.
GID00068267	Umm... I guess everybody should shoot the hell out of the target?
GID00068268	Take your time. Pick your shots and tell your squadmates who you're shooting at.
GID00068269	No, no, you're doing it all wrong! Shoot faster! *Faster!*
GID00068270	Exhale before you fire. Squeeze the trigger, don't jerk it.
GID00068271	You're never going to hit anything shooting in one direction. Fire wildly!
GID00068272	Well, I think that went well, don't you?
GID00068273	Goodbye.
GID00068274	Goodbye.
GID00068275	NCR?
GID00068276	Yes, terrible shame. Did you find anything of value on the Powder Gangers?
GID00068277	We all knew what we were getting into.
GID00068280	What did he want?
GID00068281	Yes, he was probably trying to steal some Sunset Sarsaparilla Stars from you.
GID00068282	No idea.
GID00068283	Do you have any bottlecaps with stars on them?
GID00068285	Fine. Here's 1000 caps.
GID00068286	Let's do this.
GID00068287	Stay here for now. I'll see if there's anything else I can do first.
GID00068288	You need a hired gun. I'm available.
GID00068289	It'll have to do. What now?
GID00068290	I don't need payment.
GID00068291	I'll consider it.
GID00068292	You're welcome.
GID00068293	How many are there?
GID00068294	Where's Trudy and the rest?
GID00068295	Let's go.
GID00068296	I wish I could've done more to save him.
GID00068297	I'm just passing through.
GID00068298	[Offer Toy Rocket] Hey there. I have a nice toy rocket for you.
GID00068299	[Offer Radiactive Gum] Hey kid, I have some gum here. It is good for you!
GID00068300	[Offer Toy Rocket] I found this rocket toy you can have.
GID00068301	[Offer Radiactive Gum] Here you go kid, gum is fun!
GID00068302	I'm just passing through.
GID00068303	[Offer Dinosaur Toy] Oh, then I bet you'd love this dinosaur toy.
GID00068304	[Offer Radiactive Gum] I hear dinosaurs like gum.
GID00068305	I'm just passing through.
GID00068306	Mission control, you can't fly without a rocket. Here take this toy rocket.
GID00068307	[Offer Radioactive Gum] Astronauts chew space gum.
GID00068308	I'm just passing through.
GID00068309	[Offer Toy Rocket] Hmm, will this rocket cover my toll?
GID00068310	[Offer Radioactive Gum] Here take this gum instead.
GID00068311	I'm just passing through.
GID00068312	[Offer Toy Dinosaur] Woah there Red-Brick, why don't you box with this dinosaur toy.
GID00068313	[Offer Chems] You know what will help you box better? Psycho, would you like some?
GID00068314	I'm just passing through.
GID00068315	I believe La Fantoma could use a rocket toy to enhancer her flight.
GID00068316	[Offer Radiactive Gum] Does La Fantoma need some power gum?
GID00068317	I'm just passing through.
GID00068318	Any idea why?
GID00068319	What the hell just happened?
GID00068326	How do I play?
GID00068345	Lucky Horseshoes.
GID00068348	If they don't, it's their loss.
GID00068349	He thinks you might respond better to someone who isn't an authority figure.
GID00068350	I guess you don't feel so smart now, huh?
GID00068351	Maybe I can help out.
GID00068352	It occurs to me that I might cheat.
GID00068353	I'd like to trade.
GID00068354	I'd like to know more about star hunting.
GID00068355	No, I have to be going.

GID00068427	I see a priceless work of art.
GID00068428	It's some piece of space-age technology.
GID00068429	A ship at sea.
GID00068430	I'm too embarrassed to say what it looks like.
GID00068431	A light in the darkness.
GID00068432	A bearded man.
GID00068433	A mushroom cloud.
GID00068434	A head on a pillow.
GID00068435	<Doc Outro>
GID00068438	What other towns are nearby?
GID00068439	What kind of creatures are out there?
GID00068440	That's all I wanted to know. Let's talk about something else.
GID00068441	<Speech check to get emitter>
GID00068442	Think of it as a field test. A trial run.
GID00068443	Maybe tilt the... megareceiver? To 73.5 kilonewtons...?
GID00068445	Good news. She feels the same way.
GID00068446	I'm working on it. I need to talk to Pearl first.
GID00068447	I'm working on it.
GID00068448	Recover a Lady? What are you talking about?
GID00068449	I can wait until Pearl or Loyal want to tell me.
GID00068450	Tell me about her.
GID00068451	Oh. That sort of "personal matter." Forget I asked.
GID00068452	I've had other things to attend to.
GID00068453	I've seen her, but we haven't talked about you yet.
GID00068454	I spoke to Pearl, but Janet needs a way past the artillery.
GID00068455	I told her how to get through the artillery barrage.
GID00068456	It's not my fault that your tribe blows up everyone who comes close.
GID00068457	<Lie> It's a tragedy. She loved you so much, she risked it all.
GID00068458	<Lie> She was so excited to see you, she wouldn't wait.
GID00068459	Maybe another time. Goodbye.
GID00068460	That sounds really creepy, Loyal.
GID00068461	That sounds impossible.
GID00068462	If it's so simple, why haven't you done it?
GID00068463	All right. I'm game.
GID00068464	That's just about the stupidest idea I ever heard.
GID00068465	That don't sound too smart to me.
GID00068466	Any ideas how to get to the bottom of Lake Mead without drowning?
GID00068469	Maybe I can help you whip them into shape.
GID00068470	Tough luck. If the Legion attacks, they're dead meat.
GID00068471	So, that's a no, then?
GID00068472	I wonder if anyone else would share that sentiment.
GID00068473	Great, maybe you can help me get this squad working together!
GID00068474	Since you're so respected, maybe you can help get this unit into shape.
GID00068475	That's charming. It's good to know team-building is alive and well.
GID00068476	Sounds like a bunch of winners.
GID00068477	I'm sorry, I don't know enough to help. I wish I did.
GID00068478	Player has medical knowledge.
GID00068479	I have extensive medical knowledge. Let's see what I can do.
GID00068480	Sorry. I'm sure you know more than I do.
GID00068481	<Lie> I'm a medical expert and my specialty is giant insect bites!
GID00068482	<Lie> I assume the ants' tibular nastis pierced the patients' anterior traxes?
GID00068483	Who is Mister Cuddles?
GID00068484	Sorry, I don't have time right now.
GID00068485	Ok, I'll look for him.
GID00068486	Think really hard. What were you doing when you saw him last?
GID00068487	Great work Lindsay! I'll go take a look for him.
GID00068488	I have Mister Cuddles right here.
GID00068489	<Lie> I'm sorry Lindsay. Mister Cuddles is dead.
GID00068490	<Lie> I already told you he's dead. Get over it already, kid.
GID00068491	No, I haven't found him yet.
GID00068492	Where do I start?
GID00068493	<SPEECH TEST: Player presses for details>
GID00068494	How can we trust each other if you're going to be keeping secrets?
GID00068495	I don't like being kept in dark, grandma. Clue me in.
GID00068496	Sorry, not interested. I'll be leaving.
GID00068497	Mother Pearl said you have a "bug problem?"
GID00068498	If I do, you'll be the first to know.
GID00068499	Goodbye.
GID00068500	I can handle a few ants.
GID00068501	I'll do it, even though you're just trying to get me killed.
GID00068502	Thanks, but there are easier ways to commit suicide.
GID00068503	Still in progress.
GID00068504	All dead.
GID00068505	Yes, it's safe to go down there now.
GID00068506	Well, most of the ants are dead.
GID00068507	<Lie> Yep, power on, ant's dead, all good.
GID00068508	<Lie> I... Um... Tamed the ants, you don't have to worry about them anymore.
GID00068509	Just doing my part to help out.
GID00068510	Wait. I may have missed an ant or two.
GID00068511	I'm looking for ways to make myself useful.
GID00068512	I'm still looking for ways to make myself useful.
GID00068513	I'm finished with your patients.
GID00068514	I'm finished with your patients.
GID00068515	I've finished treating your patients.
GID00068516	I'm still looking for ways to make myself useful.
GID00068517	I'm still looking for ways to make myself useful.
GID00068518	I need medical treatment.
GID00068519	Goodbye.
GID00068521	How many powder gangers are out there?
GID00068522	Maybe I can help.
GID00068523	I'll ask around and see who I can round up.
GID00068524	You don't think I can handle myself in a fight?
GID00068525	Sunny's with us.
GID00068526	Goodbye.
GID00068527	I haven't talked to her yet.
GID00068528	Goodbye.
GID00068529	Well, that was easy.
GID00068530	Just like that?
GID00068531	We might die horribly. Well, maybe not me.
GID00068532	It's odd that Cobb wasn't able to find Ringo. The town's not that big.
GID00068536	Goodbye.
GID00068537	Let them take over the town, then. I'm sure your business will be much better off.
GID00068538	The town's at stake. That has to be worth more than a few supplies.
GID00068539	Never mind.
GID00068540	I'm familiar with the care and handling of explosives, dynamite included.
GID00068541	How hard can it be? Just light them and throw.
GID00068542	Goodbye.
GID00068543	That's... helpful.
GID00068544	Never mind.
GID00068545	Goodbye.
GID00068546	Goodbye.
GID00068547	Where is Ringo now?
GID00068548	Why not just kill Cobb and be done with it?
GID00068549	What are you going to do?
GID00068550	I didn't come here to attack you.
GID00068551	Can we move this along?
GID00068552	Do you really think I'm scared of a punk like you?
GID00068553	All right. Lead the way.
GID00068554	What's a Master-At-Arms?
GID00068555	So the fact we're having this conversation means you failed, right?
GID00068557	You seem distressed. Is something going on?
GID00068558	What is this place?
GID00068559	Goodbye.
GID00068560	I'll do what I can.
GID00068561	No.
GID00068562	How'd a guy like you end up in the Army?
GID00068563	Tell me about yourself.
GID00068564	Are you in charge around here?
GID00068565	How'd you end up in the Army?
GID00068566	What do you think of Camp Golf?
GID00068567	Why are you so afraid of fighting?
GID00068568	Tell me a little more about yourself.
GID00068569	Can you tell me about your squadmates?
GID00068570	Why are you in the Army?
GID00068571	Can you tell me anything about Camp Golf?
GID00068572	So, what's your story?
GID00068573	Know anything about your squadmates?
GID00068574	Why'd you join the Army?
GID00068575	How'd you end up assigned to Camp Golf?
GID00068576	Tell me a little about yourself.
GID00068577	Sounds like you aren't too fond of your squadmates.
GID00068578	Good news - Sgt. McCredie's canceled the combat patrol.
GID00068579	How do you like serving in the Army?
GID00068580	How'd you end up at Camp Golf?
GID00068581	Sounds like you're a little disappointed in your troops.
GID00068584	He's nice, maybe a little naive. Seems convinced you're the love of his life.
GID00068585	He's a catch. You should see him blush when I flirt with him.
GID00068586	He's a special sort of guy - perfect for a special sort of gal.
GID00068587	Let me see if I can get you safe passage past the artillery.
GID00068588	<Lie> You have permission. They know you're coming.
GID00068589	<Lie> Just wave your arms and run as fast as you can.
GID00068590	I'm not sure. Let me think about it and I'll come back to you.
GID00068591	I'll ask Pearl to make an exception for you.
GID00068592	I doubt it.
GID00068593	Actually, I wanted to talk to you about him again.
GID00068594	He's doing well. I'll come back when I have some more information.
GID00068595	I got a Boomer uniform for you to wear while you cross to Nellis.
GID00068596	Not yet, but I hope to very soon.
GID00068597	How come you didn't make it into the Rangers?
GID00068598	This place doesn't seem so bad.
GID00068599	Well, maybe if you tried to lead by example instead of tearing them down.
GID00068600	You joined at 16 and you're still a sergeant?
GID00068601	That's some dedication.
GID00068602	Funny, I thought this was where they sent washouts and losers.
GID00068603	So what do you do now that the fighting's died down?
GID00068604	Let's talk about something else
GID00068605	Goodbye.
GID00068606	What are you talking about?
GID00068607	Is that going happen soon? I'd like to be around to loot your corpses.
GID00068608	I think you're overreacting.
GID00068609	I could take of Harcourt. What are you offering?
GID00068610	Or she's just lucky.
GID00068611	What are you going to do about Harcourt?
GID00068612	How are you going to get rid of her?
GID00068613	Have you talked to your superior officer?
GID00068614	Never mind.
GID00068615	I'll take it.
GID00068616	Goodbye.
GID00068617	I win more than my fair share of coin tosses. How is that a bad thing?
GID00068618	Right. Biggs mentioned you.
GID00068619	Uh, what?
GID00068620	I take it you're some kind of jinx?
GID00068621	Why do the other soldiers think you're a jinx?
GID00068622	I think a man would be very lucky indeed to catch you.
GID00068623	That has to bother you, right?
GID00068624	You put on a brave face, but I can tell that it bothers you, just a bit.
GID00068625	I'm sure the casinos of New Vegas love you.
GID00068628	Goodbye.
GID00068630	Do you know any redheads in these parts?
GID00068631	I'm looking for a redhead girl, do you know any around here?
GID00068632	I'm looking for a redheaded girl around here.
GID00068633	I don't suppose you watch the Boomers over in Nellis sometimes, do you?
GID00068634	Goodbye.
GID00068635	No reason. I'll be off now.
GID00068636	I've been inside Nellis. There's a young man there who has a crush on you.
GID00068637	"Oh?"
GID00068638	You were expecting someone else?
GID00068639	< Speech - 30 >
GID00068640	It sounds like there's an interesting story behind it.
GID00068641	Come on, you can tell me.
GID00068642	I'm looking for ways to help out. Anything come to mind?
GID00068643	Can you think of any ways I can help out?
GID00068644	What do you do here?
GID00068645	I can find you some scrap metal.
GID00068646	<Speech>
GID00068647	"Personal matter?" Nonsense. Spit it out.
GID00068648	Where I come from, we discuss personal matters all the time.
GID00068649	Loyal said you can help me breathe under water.
GID00068650	I can spare another.
GID00068651	I can spare 4 more.
GID00068652	Goodbye.
GID00068653	So tell me about this girl that caught your interest.
GID00068654	Goodbye.
GID00068655	This doesn't interest me.
GID00068656	What can you tell me about Loyal?
GID00068657	Maybe I could talk to her for you. What's she look like?
GID00068658	I'll look into it. Stranger things have happened.
GID00068659	I've got scrap metal for you.
GID00068660	Goodbye.
GID00068661	Simple enough. Run, hide, run. It's all in the timing.
GID00068662	I didn't run through all that artillery to hear your stupid questions.
GID00068663	Who's in charge here?
GID00068664	Thanks for the warning. What's going on past those signs?
GID00068665	300 caps? Nah, I've got better things to spend my caps on.
GID00068666	Is there a way to get past?
GID00068667	Thanks for the warning, but I'm leaving.
GID00068668	Just 1.
GID00068669	Just take all of it.
GID00068670	That's all for now.
GID00068671	I'm looking for ways to make myself useful.
GID00068672	Raquel said you were working on some kind of weapon to fight the giant ants?
GID00068673	<Science check to get emitter>
GID00068674	Any signal over 22,000 hertz at 150 or more decibels should do the trick.
GID00068675	Oh. Does it have a dial or something? Turn it up to 11!
GID00068676	Lady in the water? What's that?
GID00068677	Where is the bomber located?
GID00068678	How do you expect to raise a bomber from the bottom of a lake?
GID00068679	Where is the bomber located?
GID00068680	Tell me again what I need to do.
GID00068681	Your plan worked. The plane floated up. Seemed to be intact.
GID00068682	You tell me. What do people have to say about me?
GID00068683	Well, I think. I've done everything I can to help out.
GID00068684	I'm still trying to figure out who to help and how.
GID00068685	The ballast worked. The B-29 is at the surface, ready to go.
GID00068686	I've spoken to Loyal. The B-29 is on the way.
GID00068687	Goodbye.
GID00068688	Who are you?
GID00068689	I'd like to know all about your people.
GID00068690	I have some questions about your people's history.
GID00068691	How might I be of assistance?
GID00068692	How me help you?
GID00068696	Nothing today. Goodbye.
GID00068697	I'm looking for work.
GID00068698	Uh... who are you?
GID00068699	What's a Super Mutant like you doing in a place like this?
GID00068700	O... kay.
GID00068701	Nice to meet you... Mahsohfabish.
GID00068702	Do you have trouble speaking?
GID00068703	Goodbye.
GID00068704	Goodbye.
GID00068705	I'm here to buy out Cassidy Caravans for the Crimson Caravan Company.
GID00068706	I have proof that Sgt. Contreras is involved in criminal activity.
GID00068707	He wants you to increase water flow to Freeside. Said it'd be lost otherwise.
GID00068708	He was killed by a man named Anderson he caught stealing water from the NCR.
GID00068709	A gang called the Scorpions murdered him. A man named Anderson witnessed it.
GID00068710	Never mind.
GID00068711	I hacked into his computer and found evidence that he's selling NCR guns.
GID00068712	No, nothing else.
GID00068713	He admitted to manufacturing and selling chems.
GID00068714	I object to the use of violence against prisoners of war.
GID00068717	I'm going to retrieve the body of Ranger Morales.
GID00068718	Just passing through.
GID00068719	I'm going to take this basket of cakes to my grandmother's house.
GID00068720	Out of my way.
GID00068721	Actually I'm supposed to be getting a body out of there.
GID00068722	I'll take my chances.
GID00068723	Understood. Thanks for the help.
GID00068724	Yeah, yeah. This isn't rocket science. Watch and learn.
GID00068725	<Draw weapon> You're a dead man.
GID00068726	No one works for Price, so who the hell are you?
GID00068727	Isaac has me out looking for metal so they can do the first shipment.
GID00068728	Has your research here turned up anything interesting?
GID00068729	I did download some files earlier while exploring the vault.
GID00068730	Fine, do it.
GID00068731	Are these files valuable?
GID00068732	Nice to meet you.
GID00068733	Skip the introductions. Why are you here?
GID00068734	Have you seen a ghoul named Keely around here?
GID00068735	I don't have time to talk, sorry.
GID00068736	Where is Keely now?
GID00068737	I've been sent to look for her. Where is she now?
GID00068738	Not really. Is your master around?
GID00068739	Perhaps. I'll go down and look for her.
GID00068740	Why don't you go and look for her?
GID00068741	What can you tell me about this place?
GID00068742	What are you doing here?
GID00068743	What was the name of the Fiend who was carrying keys?
GID00068744	If I help you escape, will you give me the password he found?
GID00068745	Give me the password he found, and I'll help you escape.
GID00068746	<Intimidate> Give me the password or you're all going to die in here.
GID00068747	I have a couple more questions.
GID00068748	Can you make it worth my while?
GID00068749	I couldn't sleep, so I decided to take a walk.
GID00068750	Nothing.
GID00068751	I got lost. This place is so big.
GID00068752	I could ask you the same question.
GID00068756	Fine by me.
GID00068757	Fine by me.
GID00068758	I found this in Dermot's room. <Show her Dermot's ledger.>
GID00068759	I found this in Dermot's room. <Show her Dermot's ledger.>
GID00068760	We'll see how it goes.
GID00068761	We'll see how it goes.
GID00068763	I take it they were Fiends?
GID00068764	No. Never heard of them.
GID00068765	You've worked a lot of different trades?
GID00068766	Goodbye.
GID00068767	I didn't mean to offend. You don't have to tell me, if you'd rather not.
GID00068768	What happened to your parents?
GID00068769	What do you know about the Great Khans?
GID00068770	Tell me about happened to them at Bitter Springs.
GID00068771	I've heard enough. Let's talk about something else.
GID00068772	Losing your parents must have been hard for you. I'm sorry.
GID00068773	You don't really mean that, do you?
GID00068774	So your name... it comes from Bitter Springs.
GID00068775	How did you survive the massacre?
GID00068776	You're not telling me something. You couldn't have forgotten the whole massacre.
GID00068777	I really don't know. Come on, Sergeant, you can tell me.
GID00068778	Never mind. Forget I mentioned it.
GID00068779	Goodbye.
GID00068780	You don't really mean what you said about your parents, do you?
GID00068781	Hey, these medical supplies look like chem ingredients.
GID00068782	All right. I guess I believe you.
GID00068783	Bullshit. If you're moving drugs, I'm going to have to report you.
GID00068784	Lying bastard. I want cut in on this action.
GID00068785	The law is the law. I'm done doing business with you.
GID00068786	Yeah, I agree about the alcohol.
GID00068787	I don't really agree with you, but I'm not interested in moving drugs for you.
GID00068788	I'm not sure how much I can help. But I have another question.
GID00068789	Let me ask you something else.
GID00068790	I got a little turned around. Where can I find your boss?
GID00068791	Where can I find Private Crenshaw again?
GID00068792	Where is Private Crenshaw's footlocker?
GID00068795	I've heard you're kind of a prankster.
GID00068796	What kinds of pranks have you pulled?
GID00068797	That's great because I'm in the middle of pulling a prank right now.
GID00068798	<Pull Pin>I just pulled the pin out of somebody's grenade.
GID00068799	[Attack] I'm going to get you in trouble for blowing up the monorail.
GID00068800	Good news, private. I'm here to relieve you.
GID00068801	[Attack] The bad news is I'm here to relieve you of your life.
GID00068802	Never mind, I was mistaken.
GID00068803	Fascinating. Let's talk about something else.
GID00068805	You sure know how to make a girl feel welcome.
GID00068806	Can you heal me?
GID00068807	That's noble of you.
GID00068808	Good for you.
GID00068809	Wow, some protector you turned out to be.
GID00068810	I'm so sorry. Can I help?
GID00068811	Wait a minute - why didn't they take you, too?
GID00068812	They would have killed you if you fought. Maybe I can help you find them.
GID00068813	<Honest Option>
GID00068814	Yes. They're all dead.
GID00068815	Yes. They're all alive.
GID00068816	Your children are alive.
GID00068817	Your children are dead, but your wife made it.
GID00068818	Your wife and one of the children made it out alive.
GID00068819	Your wife and one of your children are dead.
GID00068820	I'm sorry. She didn't make it.
GID00068821	Dead as a doornail. Shouldn't have left her in the desert, Frankie.
GID00068822	Not yet.
GID00068823	You remember everyone who passes through here?
GID00068824	It's true. I've got a memorable face.
GID00068825	Goodbye.
GID00068826	Why did you leave the Rangers?
GID00068827	How did you manage to escape Malpais?
GID00068828	Thanks for the information.
GID00068829	Some guy is standing in for Price. I didn't inquire further.
GID00068830	Price wasn't there. I fought some guy claiming to be his replacement.
GID00068831	The guy claiming to stand in for Price is dead.
GID00068832	I convinced the Ranger to work with you. You're safe, but be careful.
GID00068833	See you later.
GID00068834	No questions right now. I'll be going.
GID00068835	How exactly should I ignite the gas?
GID00068836	Did you say there'd be a blast?
GID00068837	How am I supposed to survive that?
GID00068838	Blast?
GID00068839	And?
GID00068840	No way. I'm not going to torch myself for your amusement.
GID00068841	Where did these plants come from?
GID00068842	How did you get this whole gas thing set up so quickly?
GID00068843	What happened to the scientists, then?
GID00068844	What were you doing down in that cave?
GID00068845	Why is the door to the entrance locked?
GID00068846	That data is valuable to me.
GID00068847	Do you know how many caps I can get for it?
GID00068848	In the right hands, it could do a lot of good. I'll see it gets there.
GID00068849	Why did you move the Fiends into this Vault?
GID00068852	Goodbye.
GID00068853	What do you guys want?
GID00068854	Look, all I did was talk to him. It's no big deal.
GID00068855	All right, let's get this over with. I've got better things to do.
GID00068856	I'd hate to kill you over a misunderstanding, but if that's what you want...
GID00068872	How naive, Silus. Corruptio optimi pessima. Caesar sees you as a threat now.
GID00068873	Legum servi sumus. We are both slaves to Caesar's law. And you are in violation.
GID00068874	Timeo Danaos et dona ferentis. I posed as a mercenary to get inside the walls.
GID00068875	What's going on in Westside?
GID00068876	Motor-runner is dead. I brought his helmet as proof.
GID00068877	I don't understand how you could be so careless with the life of a ranger.
GID00068878	You did the right thing. If you'd sent more, they'd have been killed.
GID00068879	You didn't have a choice. The Fiends were a growing threat.
GID00068882	You're one of the Followers of the Apocalypse?
GID00068883	What do you do here?
GID00068884	Who are you?
GID00068885	What happened to your friend Nephi?
GID00068886	What's the deal with all these refugees?
GID00068887	What was it that brought you out here from Utah?
GID00068889	Okay, I'll look into it.
GID00068890	That's too bad, but not my problem.
GID00068891	That's a little forward, don't you think?
GID00068892	Sorry, not interested.
GID00068893	Yes. But never a woman.
GID00068895	Tell me about Maude.
GID00068896	Tell me about this "Keith."
GID00068898	I heard you were raped by Cook-cook.
GID00068899	Don't you want some payback?
GID00068900	10 of Spades blames himself.
GID00068901	You were raped. That's not something you can just shrug off.
GID00068902	You're a sniper?
GID00068903	The big gun.
GID00068904	I didn't know that all snipers wear shades.
GID00068905	Who's your partner?
GID00068906	So snipers work in pairs?
GID00068907	Actually, I didn't notice the attitude until just now.
GID00068908	How about a date? I like tough women.
GID00068909	Have you seen any serious combat here?
GID00068910	What do you mean?
GID00068911	First I've heard about conscience in a while.
GID00068912	I've killed so many people, I don't even think about it.
GID00068913	Goodbye.
GID00068914	Tell me about Keith again.
GID00068915	I've got evidence - Keith has a set of marked cards he uses to cheat.
GID00068916	I've got evidence - Keith is selling drugs to the locals.
GID00068917	I've got proof that Keith is selling drugs and using marked cards.
GID00068918	Sure, I'm in. Why not?
GID00068919	I'll leave this one to the law.
GID00068920	From what I hear, your players are pretty unlucky. What's your secret?
GID00068921	I've run some cons in my day - one clever bastard to another, what's your trick?
GID00068922	Boy... I sure could use some drugs. You know anybody that sells drugs?
GID00068923	Gambling's not my scene. Maybe you could hook me up with something "medicinal?"
GID00068924	I think I'll pass for now.
GID00068925	Marked cards, huh? A little bit obvious, but not bad.
GID00068926	I'll take it.
GID00068927	I don't have that much on me.
GID00068928	Jet's not my drug of choice. I'll keep looking.
GID00068929	Do you know Violet and Driver Nephi?
GID00068930	So, you cook all these animals around here?
GID00068931	Who are you?
GID00068932	So, why do they call you Cook-Cook, anyway?
GID00068933	What do you think of the NCR?
GID00068934	What's a "Queenie?"
GID00068935	Why do they call you Cook-Cook?
GID00068936	I'll remember that.
GID00068937	Oh. You've got a little pet. How sweet.
GID00068938	I've never been more disturbed in my entire life.
GID00068939	That's a nice club you've got there.
GID00068940	Can you tell me about Cook-Cook and Violet?
GID00068941	Who are you?
GID00068942	How many NCR citizens you figure you've killed with that club?
GID00068943	I hear you came from Utah. A friend of yours asked me to check on you. Bert?
GID00068944	It is? Really?
GID00068945	Okay, I'll tell him.
GID00068946	What do you do around here?
GID00068948	I found this ledger in Dermot's room.
GID00068949	Look what I found in your room. <Show him the teddy bear.>
GID00068952	Who are you?
GID00068953	I'm not a whore, you ugly bitch.
GID00068958	Are you s-s-sure?
GID00068959	No cause for w-w-w-what?
GID00068960	You're right. I'm sorry.
GID00068961	I shouldn't have insulted you. I'm sorry.
GID00068962	Whatever. Goodbye.
GID00068963	Goodbye.
GID00068964	Tell me what happened.
GID00068965	Never mind.
GID00068966	Yeah, hook me up!
GID00068967	I'll pass, thanks.
GID00068968	Would you sell me one?
GID00068969	I'm sure they would. I'll just stand over here.
GID00068970	Nice doggies. Want a treat?
GID00068971	Tell me about those disappearances again.
GID00068972	Who are you?
GID00068973	What exactly is this place?
GID00068974	I found this ledger in Dermot's room.
GID00068975	I found this teddy bear in Saint James' room. Look familiar?
GID00068976	Sounds like a chaotic place. Is there any way I can help?
GID00068977	Charming place. Let's talk about something else.
GID00068978	What can you tell me about the missing people?
GID00068979	I'm not really interested in running your errands, sorry.
GID00068980	Can you remember anything else?
GID00068981	I'll be back later.
GID00068982	Sure. I'll do it.
GID00068983	Sorry, still not interested.
GID00068984	I'm going to need your help.
GID00068985	How good is your squad?
GID00068986	I need your help to kill him.
GID00068987	Exactly. I'll be the bait.
GID00068988	Do you think that will work?
GID00068989	I'd rather just bring your people with me.
GID00068990	All right. I'll do it.
GID00068991	I'll see what I can do. No promises, though.
GID00068992	Forget it. I don't like the odds.
GID00068993	Goodbye.
GID00068994	Oh... Well, I'll come back when he's around.
GID00068995	You said you were handling Price's goods while he's away?
GID00068996	Just perceptive, and I assume you have nothing for sale so I'll be on my way.
GID00068997	Contreras would like to work with you.
GID00068998	Leave him alone and he'll share contact information.
GID00068999	Don't charge him and he'll help you take down the local dealers.
GID00069000	<Draw Weapon> Nevermind. I think killing you will keep things simple.
GID00069001	Goodbye.
GID00069002	That sounds good to me. What do you need done?
GID00069003	What's the deal with all the dogs?
GID00069004	What exactly are you on?
GID00069005	What do you know about Driver Nephi and Cook-Cook?
GID00069006	Who are you?
GID00069007	Where do you get all this meat?
GID00069008	Hsu won't trust me enough to let me investigate.
GID00069009	I've got to talk to you about Alice.
GID00069010	Is there any work to be had here?
GID00069011	Who did you say I should ask about work?
GID00069012	Who are you?
GID00069013	McCarran is looking for a regular delivery of meat from local merchants.
GID00069014	Corporal Farber said they can pay you the going market price in caps.
GID00069015	They have an tons of vegetables and water. How about expanding your business?
GID00069016	McCarran could work out a regular exchange of fresh vegetables and clean water.
GID00069017	Goodbye.
GID00069018	I could use some directions.
GID00069019	I need a doctor.
GID00069020	I'm looking to buy and sell things.
GID00069021	What do you do around here?
GID00069022	Tell me about the farms.
GID00069023	Who's ungrateful?
GID00069024	Anything you tell me stays with me.
GID00069025	Come on, you can tell me.
GID00069026	Are there more dangerous posts?
GID00069027	If the Fiends are so dangerous, why hasn't the NCR wiped them out?
GID00069028	Fine, take it.
GID00069029	A hundred caps? Forget it.
GID00069030	I don't have that much.
GID00069031	Why don't both of you get out of here? I'll make sure you have time to get away.
GID00069032	I'm on it.
GID00069033	I've got other things in mind, right now.
GID00069034	I'll deal with them.
GID00069035	I've got other things in mind, right now.
GID00069036	Okay, I'll go see her.
GID00069037	I've got other things in mind, right now.
GID00069039	I haven't sent them to the sewers, yet.
GID00069040	I've taken care of those troublemakers.
GID00069041	I've taken care of those troublemakers.
GID00069043	I've dealt with those newcomers.
GID00069044	Not yet. I'll get on it.
GID00069045	I've dealt with those newcomers.
GID00069046	I'm not interested in this right now.
GID00069047	Alice's "friends" plan to use her to steal your Crimson Caravan earnings.
GID00069048	So, about Alice...
GID00069049	Have time to tell me about any work you need done?
GID00069050	I've got proof of what I've said.
GID00069051	Is there any work to do here?
GID00069052	Okay, I'll do it.
GID00069053	Anything I should know about New Vegas?
GID00069054	Tell me about the Fiends.
GID00069055	What do you know about the NCR?
GID00069056	I have some general questions for you.
GID00069057	That's all I want to know right now.
GID00069058	Who sells equipment around here?
GID00069059	Know where I can find a doctor?
GID00069060	Fine. Tell me what you know.
GID00069061	[Attack] Then I may as well beat you to death for personal satisfaction.
GID00069062	What can you tell me about Driver Nephi?
GID00069063	What do you know about the Fiends?
GID00069064	You're having trouble with the Fiends?
GID00069065	Goodbye.
GID00069066	Yes, it does.
GID00069067	Might be. Give me their names.
GID00069068	No. I don't think so.
GID00069069	Violet.
GID00069070	Driver Nephi.
GID00069071	Cook-Cook.
GID00069072	None of them.
GID00069073	Where can I find her?
GID00069074	Anything else I need to know?
GID00069075	Where is Lt. Gorobets?
GID00069076	Who is Little Buster?
GID00069077	All right. I'll go after Violet.
GID00069078	All right. I'll go after Driver Nephi.
GID00069079	All right. I'll go after Cook-cook.
GID00069080	No, I've had enough for now.
GID00069081	All right. I'll do it.
GID00069082	Never mind. No more bounties, for now.
GID00069083	No. I've had enough.
GID00069084	Actually, I have another head here.
GID00069085	Already done. Here's the head.
GID00069086	Never mind. No more bounties, for now.
GID00069087	Got anything to eat?
GID00069088	I'd like to buy some food.
GID00069089	Can anything be done to improve your supplies?
GID00069090	What parts are needed to fix the food processor?
GID00069091	Where might I find these parts?
GID00069092	Where should I look for spices?
GID00069093	Mrs. Nash agreed to trade with McCarran.
GID00069094	Mrs. Nash agreed to trade snacks for vegetables and water.
GID00069095	Blake at the Crimson Caravan agreed to sell meat and spices.
GID00069096	The Crimson Caravan agreed to trade meat and spices for vegetables and water.
GID00069097	The Crimson Caravan agreed to trade meat and spices at a generous discount.
GID00069098	I found a merchant named Fitz who agreed to sell meat to McCarran.
GID00069099	I fixed the food processor.
GID00069100	This spore pod extract from Keely should help with morale.
GID00069103	I'd like to buy some supplies.
GID00069104	Son of a... Sir, I didn't know anything about this.
GID00069105	<Draw Weapon> And now I'm going to kill you, you lying son of a bitch.
GID00069106	<Draw Weapon> Nothing now. I think I'll end your little investigation here.
GID00069107	<Draw Weapon> Special delivery!
GID00069108	McCarran's mess hall needs more variety. Could we work out a deal?
GID00069109	<Give 200 caps> Alright. 200 caps it is.
GID00069110	<Give 100 caps> 200 seems a bit steep. How about 100?
GID00069111	McCarran has more vegetables and water than they know what to do with...
GID00069112	Maybe we could work something out later.
GID00069113	I can bring his body back, but it'll cost you.
GID00069114	Changed his mind about what?
GID00069115	Goodbye.
GID00069116	You look upset. What's wrong?
GID00069117	I haven't found him yet.
GID00069118	I brought his body to an NCR position. He's on his way back to McCarran.
GID00069119	If your husband is dead, what does it matter if you get the corpse back?
GID00069120	It seems strange the NCR wouldn't do their best to retrieve a fallen comrade.
GID00069121	Sorry for your loss. I hope the Colonel reconsiders.
GID00069122	How did he die?
GID00069123	Not my problem. Goodbye.
GID00069124	Give me the directions again.
GID00069125	I'll recover your husband's body.
GID00069126	Goodbye.
GID00069127	Goodbye.
GID00069128	No one else will help you?
GID00069129	Some other guy replaced Price, and he definitely didn't know the password.
GID00069130	You said you have some legwork needing done?
GID00069131	Maybe later.
GID00069132	I'll do it.
GID00069133	We can talk later. Right now we need to get out of here.
GID00069134	No, I was just exploring the vault when I stumbled on this place.
GID00069135	I was sent to fetch some research data. No one said anything about a rescue.
GID00069136	Of course. I'd be glad to help.
GID00069137	How much are you paying?
GID00069138	No deal. You'll have to do it without me.
GID00069139	Sure, how can I help?
GID00069140	Just as long as I'm getting paid for this.
GID00069141	The hell I am. The door to the entrance is locked!
GID00069142	I told you. I'm not helping you.
GID00069143	Sounds dangerous, but I'll do it.
GID00069144	You're out of your mind.
GID00069145	Any idea where these vents are that I'm looking for?
GID00069146	What needs to be done?
GID00069147	Wait! Don't delete the files!
GID00069148	I need those files. Dr. Hildern specifically sent me here to find them.
GID00069149	If we destroy the files, all of these people will have died in vain.
GID00069150	Deleting those files makes it more likely that this will happen again.
GID00069151	Science isn't just about success. Failures are just as important to learn from.
GID00069152	Exactly. Without that knowledge, something similar is bound to occur.
GID00069153	Will it take long?
GID00069154	Actually, I copied the files. Hildern sent me here to get them.
GID00069155	I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
GID00069156	Positive.
GID00069157	On second thought, go ahead and erase the data.
GID00069158	Good riddance. Those files have caused enough trouble.
GID00069159	<Lie> No, I've been too busy rescuing you. Could someone else have done it?
GID00069160	Never mind. Go ahead and delete the files.
GID00069161	No, should they have?
GID00069162	The scientists here must have made some useful discoveries.
GID00069163	Yes, Angela Williams asked me to come find you.
GID00069165	I just have a couple questions.
GID00069166	I just have a couple questions.
GID00069167	I could use your help taking care of Motor-Runner.
GID00069168	I could use your help taking care of Motor-Runner.
GID00069169	I think you should head back to McCarran to have that leg looked at.
GID00069170	I think you should head back to base to have that leg looked at.
GID00069171	<Lie> I think your leg's in good enough shape. You're all set.
GID00069172	<Lie> I think you are healthy enough to take care of Motor-Runner yourself.
GID00069173	Just making sure you're okay. I'll be back.
GID00069174	That's all for now, soldier.
GID00069175	Not right now, just making sure you are ok. I'll be back later.
GID00069176	That's it for now soldier.
GID00069177	What can you tell me about the Fiends?
GID00069178	What can you tell me about the Fiends?
GID00069179	What can you tell me about Vault 3?
GID00069180	What can you tell me about Vault 3?
GID00069181	What was your mission again?
GID00069182	What was your mission again?
GID00069183	Let's talk about something else.
GID00069184	Let's talk about something else.
GID00069185	Come on. It's time for us to go take care of Motor-Runner.
GID00069186	Follow me, let's go take care of Motor-Runner.
GID00069187	Wait here.
GID00069188	Wait here.
GID00069189	I can handle myself pretty well. I found you didn't I?
GID00069190	Trust me. I can be quiet.
GID00069191	SPEECH attempt for Bryce to let you take out Motor Runner
GID00069192	I can handle myself just fine. I found you, didn't I?
GID00069193	Trust me, I'm tougher than I look!
GID00069194	Alright, I don't want to cause you any trouble.
GID00069195	All right, fine. I don't want to cause you any trouble.
GID00069196	I have another couple of questions for you.
GID00069197	Let me ask you some questions.
GID00069198	Ok, 200 is a deal.
GID00069199	I'll sell you all of my Jet for 20 caps each.
GID00069200	I'll sell you all of my Jet for 22 caps each.
GID00069201	I'll sell you all my Psycho for 20 caps each.
GID00069202	I'll sell you all of my Psycho for 22 caps each.
GID00069203	I'll sell you all my Buffout for 20 caps each.
GID00069204	I'll sell you all of my Buffout for 22 caps each.
GID00069205	That is all I can spare.
GID00069206	Nothing left to sell, time for me to leave.
GID00069207	Nevermind, I'll just show myself out.
GID00069208	I'll pay you, I'm sure I can make up the difference from NCR.
GID00069209	You should pay me, I'm providing you the service.
GID00069210	How about you give me 75 caps, it'll keep the hit squads away for a bit.
GID00069211	I was thinking closer to 150.
GID00069212	The NCR is leaving you alone, 150 seems like a small price to pay.
GID00069213	Actually, I can just bring them your head for free.
GID00069214	What are you doing here?
GID00069215	Yeah, I'll see what I can do.
GID00069216	I need to know a little more about Vault 3.
GID00069217	Can you tell me about the Fiends?
GID00069218	Sorry, I don't have time to help you out.
GID00069219	Colonel Hsu wanted me to help you look into the recent intelligence leaks.
GID00069220	I know who you are. I'm working for the Legion, too.
GID00069221	Hsu bought it. You should be in the clear.
GID00069222	Goodbye.
GID00069223	I have clearance for catching spies.
GID00069224	You don't seem like you're supposed to be here, either.
GID00069225	Is there a bathroom in here?
GID00069226	It's done. The evidence is in Crenshaw's locker and Crenshaw is dead.
GID00069227	I have a lead. There's been someone sneaking into the control tower at night.
GID00069228	How many years have you been on this assignment?
GID00069229	What next part?
GID00069230	And you have something in mind for me?
GID00069231	Tell me what I need to do.
GID00069232	The scapegoat isn't me, is it?
GID00069233	Understood. I'll go and pick up the explosives.
GID00069234	Could you go over that again?
GID00069235	If you're going to blow it up, what do you need my help for?
GID00069236	I'm not interested in helping you. You're on your own.
GID00069237	You're right. I'll help.
GID00069238	I'm positive.
GID00069239	I heard someone's been breaking in here at night. Looks like it's you.
GID00069240	I don't. I was just trying to get myself out of trouble.
GID00069241	Hsu is dead.
GID00069242	What do you do here?
GID00069243	Who should I be talking to about the intelligence leaks again?
GID00069249	VMS08CurtisRadio3.5
GID00069256	I'd rather not have any trouble. Here's 50 caps, just keep yourself off the streets.
GID00069257	I'm asking nicely. I only do that *once.*
GID00069258	I'm asking nicely. Maybe you should go before I get angry at you.
GID00069259	<Attack> Easy, I'm just going to kill you.
GID00069260	Crandon says you're not allowed to stay here. You'll have to go somewhere else.
GID00069261	May I ask you some questions?
GID00069262	Where can I find a doctor around here?
GID00069263	Is there any place to buy weapons and armor?
GID00069264	I don't have any more questions. Let's talk about something else.
GID00069265	Are there many water merchants around here?
GID00069266	I work independently.
GID00069267	How many agents of the Legion *are* there here?
GID00069268	I understand.
GID00069269	Uh huh. Bring fire stick.
GID00069270	Go over that one more time.
GID00069271	Wha?
GID00069272	[Speech] You must miss giving orders, now that all your men are dead.
GID00069273	[Speech] Sounds to me like you were too gutless to follow Caesar's orders.
GID00069274	[Speech] Yes. I want to *know* how such a big talker got caught so easily.
GID00069275	You're a danger to him alive. Your knowledge threatens him.
GID00069276	Caesar's laws are absolute. He does not grant exceptions.
GID00069277	So in addition to treason, you're also a deserter.
GID00069278	[Speech] You must've really screwed up to be caught by the NCR.
GID00069279	You sure talk tough for someone who's afraid to die.
GID00069280	But I want to know how a coward can attain the rank of centurion.
GID00069281	I'll be right back.
GID00069282	You shouldn't have done that. I'm the only friend you have right now.
GID00069283	Did you honestly believe you could escape death?
GID00069284	Oh, but I do, Silus. Unlike you, I follow Caesar's orders.
GID00069285	[Attack] Then you won't mind if I keep going.
GID00069286	[Attack] Lucky you. You can borrow my dentures when I knock all your teeth out.
GID00069287	If his empire falls, it'll probably be because his centurions are so gullible.
GID00069288	Your loyalty is commendable, but I don't work for Caesar's Legion.
GID00069289	I'll be the judge of that. Let's hear what you've got to say.
GID00069290	[Attack] If you've got any last words, you'd better say them now, Legion scum.
GID00069291	You've been tricked, Silus. I'm working with the NCR. I just got you to talk.
GID00069292	And if you can't go through with it, you look even weaker.
GID00069293	So you were unafraid to cut any throat but your own.
GID00069294	See? Don't you feel better now that you've divulged all those state secrets?
GID00069295	I think I've heard all I need to. You've been very helpful.
GID00069296	Who's the operative?
GID00069297	I don't believe you. You're lying.
GID00069298	Maybe I'll beat some more useful information out of you.
GID00069299	There must be more you can tell me.
GID00069300	Yes, I have it here.
GID00069301	No, not yet.
GID00069302	Have you seen a guy named Price around?
GID00069303	Brahmin tipping is a cherished pastime.
GID00069304	I'm looking for some betting advice.
GID00069305	Uh... do you like... gambling?
GID00069306	Um, well... Nevermind.
GID00069307	Close enough. Yeah, Contreras told me to give Price this package.
GID00069308	<Draw Weapon> We agreed you should die.
GID00069309	He said he would help you.
GID00069310	I had no idea that package had chems! Contreras gave it to me!
GID00069311	<Draw Weapon> You'll never take me alive, pig!
GID00069312	Who the hell are you?
GID00069313	<Draw Weapon> You won't be telling anyone about this.
GID00069314	Hey, I'm just the messenger. I didn't know anything about this.
GID00069315	C'mon guy. You're no merchant. You've got Ranger all over you.
GID00069316	[INT/PER] Hey, that wasn't the right response for the password!
GID00069317	The way you stand, your weapon, even your armor is fitted in a military fashion.
GID00069318	I'm sure Contreras could work with you.
GID00069319	<Give 250 caps> I'm sure Contreras would be willing to work with you...
GID00069320	Just some supplies for McCarran from the Crimson Caravan.
GID00069321	<cover package> Oh this? Nothing important.
GID00069322	What's going to happen to him?
GID00069323	Ok. I'll just be on my way then.
GID00069324	<Draw Weapon> Well, I can't just let him be killed. Word of this stops here.
GID00069325	I was just told he was a local merchant and to find him to buy some supplies.
GID00069326	<Give 250 caps> Okay, make that 500 caps. I'm sure Contreras can skim for you.
GID00069327	<Draw Weapon> I think I'll just take my caps back from your corpse.
GID00069328	Here. Take this package Contreras gave me. I don't want any trouble.
GID00069329	Well, I was given this package to deliver to him.
GID00069330	Nothing. I was just told he was a local merchant I should check out.
GID00069331	Oh, just delivering packages. No clue whats in em, but its really important.
GID00069332	Price is being held by the NCR. A Ranger replaced him.
GID00069333	I didn't really have a choice.
GID00069334	We don't have to kill him. You could work with him and make caps.
GID00069335	Kill him? Can't we just cut a deal or something?
GID00069336	<Hand Contreras the package> Nah, but he is definitely looking for you.
GID00069337	Killing a Ranger brings big risks. Killing gets expensive.
GID00069338	Hey man, you never said anything about killing. Cough up some caps.
GID00069339	Don't worry. He won't be telling anyone anything ever again.
GID00069340	All right, what's the job?
GID00069341	Sounds simple enough. I'll get right on it.
GID00069342	Don't worry. I paid him off. He won't be a problem.
GID00069343	Got anything for sale?
GID00069344	He's looking to break up trafficking. Maybe there is money to be made here...
GID00069345	No problem. Consider it done.
GID00069346	Isaac said they'll have the extra guns and ammo in the next shipment.
GID00069347	I took care of the Ranger.
GID00069348	I convinced the Ranger to work with you. You're safe, but be careful.
GID00069349	That's it? A few caps and another errand?
GID00069350	Can you tell me anything else about Keely?
GID00069351	I hear the food around here is pretty bad.
GID00069352	What do you think of Dr. Hildern?
GID00069353	Hildern mentioned the Followers of the Apocalypse...
GID00069354	What's your role here?
GID00069355	Goodbye.
GID00069356	Exactly how old is Keely?
GID00069357	That's not much of an endorsement. What do you *really* think?
GID00069358	He seemed focused on results. Maybe not so much on people.
GID00069359	So Dr. Hildern takes credit for your work?
GID00069360	Keely's dead. But I found her research notes.
GID00069361	How do Keely and Hildern get along?
GID00069362	Keely's dead.
GID00069363	<Lie> Keely is safe. She's just finishing up some research in the vault.
GID00069364	Goodbye.
GID00069365	<Lie> Yes, Keely's fine. We escaped the Vault together.
GID00069366	Actually, I have an invoice for you from Alice McLafferty.
GID00069367	You mentioned Vault 22. I might be willing to help.
GID00069368	I have a few questions.
GID00069369	I have an invoice for you from Alice McLafferty.
GID00069370	Then you don't want this invoice from Alice McLafferty?
GID00069371	Goodbye.
GID00069372	What?
GID00069373	No need to get worked up. I'll leave.
GID00069374	Isn't this Vault 3, home of the Fiends?
GID00069375	Let's see how tough you are.
GID00069376	Speech Attempt to Gain Entrance
GID00069377	Your boss, um... He summoned me here.
GID00069378	I'm carrying Jet, Psycho, and other favors. And I don't deliver to the help.
GID00069379	Where's your boss? He'll want to know you were hitting me up for freebies.
GID00069380	I'm not a Khan. I'm just dressed like one.
GID00069381	I have some chems that I can sell.
GID00069382	I'm here to do some business with chems.
GID00069383	You want to buy some chems from my personal stash?
GID00069384	I'm just here looking around.
GID00069385	Can you tell me what happened to the residents here?
GID00069386	I'll be leaving now.
GID00069387	The NCR sent me here to take care of you.
GID00069388	I was actually just leaving.
GID00069389	Appearances can be deceiving. Shall we?
GID00069390	I'll sell you a can of Jet for 20 caps.
GID00069391	I'll sell you a can of Jet for 22 caps.
GID00069392	I'll sell you a pack of Buffout for 20 caps.
GID00069393	I'll sell you a pack of Buffout for 22 caps.
GID00069394	I'll sell you a vial of Psycho for 20 caps.
GID00069395	I'll sell you a vial of Psycho for 22 caps.
GID00069396	I'll give you exclusive rights to my personal stash, for a slight markup.
GID00069397	I don't suppose you can pay a little better?
GID00069398	Let's talk about something else.
GID00069399	I was thinking we could make an arrangement.
GID00069400	I could just tell them you are dead. For a price.
GID00069401	I can deliver them your cold, dead skull.
GID00069402	Tell me more about your role here.
GID00069403	I'm a friend, trust me.
GID00069404	I respect your independence, and I'm good at taking care of troubles.
GID00069405	What kind of trouble?
GID00069406	Doesn't the NCR keep order around here?
GID00069407	You need somebody with real firepower, and mine's yours for a small fee.
GID00069408	I'm not interested in this, right now.
GID00069409	If you've got the caps, I'll back any claim you want.
GID00069410	I've got the skills, the will and the firepower. All I expect is a decent reward for my work.
GID00069411	What is this place?
GID00069412	Are you a scientist?
GID00069413	What's your role here?
GID00069414	Need help with anything?
GID00069415	Mercenaries? What for?
GID00069416	Goodbye.
GID00069417	Yes. He asked me to get some data from Vault 22.
GID00069418	Why so interested?
GID00069419	You're right. It's none of your business.
GID00069420	No. Hildern didn't mention anyone else.
GID00069421	All right. I'll look for her.
GID00069422	Maybe Hildern and I need to have another talk.
GID00069423	It never came up. Doesn't bother me.
GID00069424	I'll try, but no promises.
GID00069425	Not my problem. Keely is on her own.
GID00069426	I have some questions.
GID00069427	Goodbye.
GID00069429	Show me what you have for sale.
GID00069430	Goodbye.
GID00069431	What else can you tell me about Anders?
GID00069432	Tell me about the break-ins.
GID00069433	Who's missing?
GID00069434	You said there have been thefts?
GID00069435	Let's talk about something else.
GID00069436	I'll keep an eye out for your missing supplies.
GID00069437	Why don't you just beat your prisoner senseless?
GID00069438	What about a truth drug?
GID00069439	Have you tried calling him hurtful names?
GID00069440	Okay. Let's get started.
GID00069441	I'm not interested in doing that right now.
GID00069442	I'll see what I can find out about Cpl. White for you.
GID00069443	I'm a friend of the Legion. I'm here to help.
GID00069444	<Lie> I'm with the Legion. I'm here to kill you before you talk.
GID00069445	[Speech] I think you're confused. I'm with the excrement right now.
GID00069446	[Speech] You... *smell* like excrement. So there.
GID00069447	[Speech] You stinky!
GID00069448	You're about to tell me everything you know, Silus.
GID00069449	[Attack] Uh oh. Now you've made me angry.
GID00069450	What officer?
GID00069451	Here are the medical supplies from Blake.
GID00069452	I'm ready for the next task.
GID00069453	Right... Well, I'll keep that in mind.
GID00069454	I had some other questions.
GID00069455	Never mind. Goodbye.
GID00069456	Never mind. Goodbye.
GID00069457	What do you think of NCR's chances against the Legion?
GID00069458	Keely wiped the data. It's gone.
GID00069459	Yes. Tell me about it.
GID00069460	I just have some questions.
GID00069461	No. "Civilized" people stack the deck in their own favor, don't they?
GID00069462	Goodbye.
GID00069463	Why terminate her contract?
GID00069464	You didn't always work for the OSI?
GID00069465	So who *did* train you?
GID00069466	And what do the Followers believe?
GID00069467	Doesn't sound like a good place for a person of ambition.
GID00069468	So... you wanted something more?
GID00069469	You're researching all these problems yourself?
GID00069470	The Vault 22 data is gone. Destroyed.
GID00069471	The plants in that vault were dangerous. We destroyed the data.
GID00069472	Believe whatever you want. It's the truth.
GID00069473	I just have some questions.
GID00069474	Goodbye.
GID00069475	All right. I'll investigate Vault 22.
GID00069476	Make it fast. I want my caps.
GID00069477	Damn right. No thanks to you.
GID00069478	By the way, that Vault was just as dangerous as Williams thought.
GID00069479	What's your opinion of Williams?
GID00069480	Let's talk about something else.
GID00069481	Tell me what an NCR ranger is doing here.
GID00069482	<Lie>I'm an independent contractor with the NCR.
GID00069483	I'm just curious.
GID00069484	I didn't come here to do your job for you.
GID00069485	Why is this water so special?
GID00069486	I've got the whiskey.
GID00069488	Who are you?
GID00069489	Do you need any help?
GID00069490	Have you noticed anything suspicious lately?
GID00069491	What kind of supplies did you have in mind?
GID00069492	Nevermind.
GID00069493	[50 caps] Maybe some caps will clarify things.
GID00069494	I can be pretty resourceful. Perhaps we could work out a deal?
GID00069495	Come on, man. Hook me up.
GID00069496	I've got connections. Maybe we could make an arrangement?
GID00069497	I've got caps. Name your price.
GID00069499	I have some questions.
GID00069500	I'm not the first person you've sent to Vault 22... am I?
GID00069501	Goodbye.
GID00069502	I'm the one asking the questions, Dr. Hildern.
GID00069503	<Lie> No, Williams didn't tell me anything.
GID00069504	Yes, I have. What difference does it make?
GID00069505	You're doing all these things yourself?
GID00069506	NCR has a food shortage?
GID00069507	Do you control the Dam from here?
GID00069508	Fantastic.
GID00069509	No, that was me. I fixed HELIOS One.
GID00069510	How many others have you sent to the Vault?
GID00069511	I prefer to know what I'm getting myself into.
GID00069512	Maybe I should cancel our deal.
GID00069513	I want double the caps. Or I spread the word that you're full of shit.
GID00069514	Goodbye.
GID00069515	It doesn't trouble you that you sent eight or ten people to their deaths?
GID00069516	Then you broke our agreement. I want double the caps.
GID00069517	Let me take another look at that leg.
GID00069518	What can you tell me about this place?
GID00069519	Never mind, I'm leaving now.
GID00069520	What am I doing here? What are you doing here?
GID00069521	What can you tell me about what happened here?
GID00069522	What is this place?
GID00069523	Who are the Fiends?
GID00069524	The Colonel was concerned. You missed your check-in.
GID00069525	Colonel Hsu thinks you need additional support.
GID00069526	I'm sure you can handle it alone. I'll leave you to it.
GID00069527	I want to help you rescue the hostages.
GID00069528	SPEECH attempt to convince Bryce to help take out Motor-Runner
GID00069529	The only way you're going to take out Motor-Runner is if we work together.
GID00069530	The only way you're going to take out Motor-Runner is if we work together.
GID00069531	Let's you and me take out Motor-Runner together!
GID00069532	Let me take out Motor-Runner for you.
GID00069533	I'll leave you to it then.
GID00069534	What's the hold-up - if you don't mind my asking?
GID00069535	MEDICINE attempt to convince Bryce
GID00069536	I'm afraid your leg looks - and smells - like it's on the verge of infection.
GID00069537	A day or two of resting up isn't going to heal that leg.
GID00069538	If you head for McCarran now, I think you'll make it in time - even at a limp.
GID00069539	I have a doctor's bag right here. It should be enough to get you on your feet.
GID00069540	You need a doctor's bag. I'll find one and come back.
GID00069541	I'll check in with you and Colonel Hsu when it's done.
GID00069542	I don't have a spare doctor's bag I can spare.
GID00069543	[Attack] I did. Right before I assassinated the colonel.
GID00069544	It was Curtis. He's in the Legion. I can prove he tried to blow up the monorail.
GID00069545	I caught Curtis radioing intel to Caesar's Legion. I had to take him down.
GID00069546	The monorail is destroyed.
GID00069550	Goodbye.
GID00069551	Goodbye.
GID00069552	Bye bye.
GID00069553	Show me what you have for sale.
GID00069554	Where do you get your water?
GID00069555	Punk? Thats my line.
GID00069556	Are you deserters?
GID00069557	I guess I can understand that.
GID00069558	<Attack> Well then. It sounds like there might be a bounty on your heads.
GID00069559	So that's it? You've resorted to robbing and raiding to solve your problems?
GID00069560	<Attack> Well, I think your luck just ran out.
GID00069561	Why not just turn yourselves in?
GID00069562	You're right. You're totally screwed.
GID00069563	<Speech>
GID00069564	Your turf? I guess the news hasn't reached you yet, Primm has law again.
GID00069565	I can help if you'll let me!
GID00069566	<Attack> Well, in that case, maybe I'll do the town a favor and take you down.
GID00069567	<Lie> Yes, that's right.
GID00069568	No, this is the first I've heard about Vault 22.
GID00069569	Goodbye.
GID00069570	I'd be careful with that data. You didn't see those plants in the Vault.
GID00069571	BUGGED LINE BELOW
GID00069572	Depends. How much are you paying?
GID00069573	This all sounds a little hard to believe.
GID00069574	This doesn't sound like my kind of job.
GID00069575	I'll think about it, and maybe I'll be back.
GID00069576	Forget it. I don't have time for this.
GID00069577	I'm listening.
GID00069578	Save the sales pitch. Just tell me what you want me to do.
GID00069579	Yes, I'd say so.
GID00069580	Nothing is impossible.
GID00069581	Get to the point.
GID00069582	All right. I'll do it.
GID00069583	I'll think about it.
GID00069584	Goodbye.
GID00069585	Tell me more about the OSI.
GID00069586	Anything else I should know?
GID00069587	Actually, I had some other questions.
GID00069588	I had some other questions.
GID00069589	Tell me more.
GID00069590	Scientific discovery is never so simple as that.
GID00069591	What do you need me to do?
GID00069592	Well... consider it a down payment on future service.
GID00069593	I've brought the data from Vault 22.
GID00069594	Never mind. I'll be back later.
GID00069595	No problem. I can wait.
GID00069596	By the way... you never warned me about the dangers in that place.
GID00069597	Fine. Just give me my reward.
GID00069598	Glad to be of service.
GID00069599	I agree, I've more than done my part. You owe me more caps.
GID00069600	All right. Then I'll sell this data to some other interested party...
GID00069601	What contract? You cut an under-the-table deal with me.
GID00069602	...and make sure you have some healthy competition.
GID00069603	You said you were the Director of OSI?
GID00069604	Then it wouldn't matter if I mentioned our deal to the colonel?
GID00069605	Who are the Fiends?
GID00069606	I'm here to provide support. Is there anything I might be able to help with?
GID00069607	I'm up for hire if you need some extra manpower around the base.
GID00069608	How are things going for the NCR around here?
GID00069609	The Fiends?
GID00069610	I bet I could make the Legion prisoner talk.
GID00069611	I could look into who's leaking NCR intelligence.
GID00069612	Let's talk about something else.
GID00069613	I know who bombed the monorail.
GID00069614	You won't be having problems with intelligence leaks anymore.
GID00069615	How much do you know about what happened with the NCR at Bitter Springs?
GID00069616	You seem calm given that things are as bad as they are.
GID00069617	[Speech] I've been fighting for the wrong side. Let me prove myself to you.
GID00069618	Private Crenshaw. He's dead now.
GID00069619	He had explosives and plans for the operation bearing Caesar's emblem.
GID00069620	He had explosives and plans for the operation bearing Caesar's emblem.
GID00069621	[Speech] He confessed it to me before he died. He used the word "frumentarius."
GID00069622	[Speech] He confessed it to me. Right before he died.
GID00069623	You'd be surprised what some people are capable of.
GID00069624	I'll be right back - there's something I need to double-check.
GID00069625	I'll go to Vault 3 and see if I can find your ranger.
GID00069628	Will you sign this formal letter asking the NCR to take control of Primm?
GID00069629	How do you know these things?
GID00069630	How do you know these things?
GID00069631	What will you do now?
GID00069635	Sorry, I was just leaving.
GID00069636	NCR doesn't have the caps to outfit their troops?
GID00069637	Go on.
GID00069638	Are you with the NCR?
GID00069642	Something like that. Are you an NCR soldier?
GID00069643	You do a lot of business with prospectors?
GID00069644	Just show me what you have for sale.
GID00069645	Administrative discharge? What does that mean?
GID00069646	What was your rank?
GID00069647	How did you end up selling weapons?
GID00069648	You say Marcus smashed the radio. Not very well, apparently?
GID00069649	Okay, I can make that work.
GID00069650	That's your plan? I *am* an intruder in the village!
GID00069651	Not yet. Wait here.
GID00069662	They had it coming if they drew on you.
GID00069663	So thats it? You've resorted to raiding and crime?
GID00069664	Perhaps I could convince them to take you back.
GID00069665	I'll see what I can do.
GID00069666	I'll see what I can do.
GID00069667	You're right. You guys are totally screwed.
GID00069668	Well you made the right one.
GID00069670	What sort of trouble should I expect if I head up?
GID00069671	Remind me what I should expect if I head up?
GID00069672	Sounds like you've had enough of Tabitha. What if you had some help?
GID00069673	Hey! Let's you and me - you know, us! - let's overthrow Tabitha together!
GID00069674	How did Tabitha end up in control?
GID00069675	What is Jacobstown?
GID00069676	You say that super mutants were *made*?
GID00069677	Tell me about the Nightkin.
GID00069678	Why are you here, instead of Jacobstown?
GID00069679	You seem friendly, for a mutant.
GID00069680	Moving on...
GID00069681	Sorry about that. No offense intended.
GID00069682	Spare me the "poor mutants" rap, all right?
GID00069683	Why are some Super Mutants smarter than others?
GID00069687	Sorry, I don't think I'll be heading her way.
GID00069689	Sure, follow me.
GID00069692	[Dumb] Uh... what?
GID00069694	Aren't you the super mutant from the radio? I'm a huge fan.
GID00069696	<Say nothing.>
GID00069698	We no follow you no more! We follow Neil! He no call us dumb-dumbs!
GID00069699	We no dumb-dumbs! You the stupid, not us! We's taking over!
GID00069700	We no follow you no more! We follow Neil! He no call us dumb-dumbs!
GID00069701	Hi. We "dumb-dumbs" is rebelling! You no lead us no more!
GID00069707	What will you do now?
GID00069709	Goodbye.
GID00069710	Bye bye.
GID00069711	Hey, just checking the place out. Now I'll just be on my way...
GID00069712	Okay. Here.
GID00069713	I don't have that many caps.
GID00069714	But I don't even have that much.
GID00069715	<Pay 50 caps> Okay, here.
GID00069716	No raider would be foolish enough to go parading around in that.
GID00069717	By extorting money from the locals? What happened here?
GID00069718	It looks like these people got more than just hurt.
GID00069719	There is always a choice.
GID00069720	You're welcome to try.
GID00069724	Tell me about Gun Runner caravans.
GID00069727	Why don't you deal in energy weapons?
GID00069729	I made sure those prisoners won't bother Primm anymore.
GID00069730	I restored rule of law to Primm.
GID00069731	I've cleared all the trouble west of here. Caravans can start using I-15 again.
GID00069733	Got nothing to spare.
GID00069734	Can't help you.
GID00069735	Can't help you.
GID00069736	Can't help you.
GID00069737	Sure. Here's 25 caps.
GID00069739	Do your thinking about "Everywhere."
GID00069741	On second thought... maybe another time.
GID00069743	Do your thinking about me.
GID00069745	Do your thinking about "Here."
GID00069746	Why'd you settle in this dump?
GID00069747	What do you know about Legion raids?
GID00069748	Who are you?
GID00069750	Primm's safe now. I took care of those prisoners.
GID00069751	Why's this place called the 188?
GID00069753	Is it safe here?
GID00069755	Why's business so good here?
GID00069757	Why'd you leave Primm?
GID00069759	Who are you?
GID00069761	I took care of those prisoners myself. Primm is clear now.
GID00069781	I'd like a tour of the museum.
GID00069782	I'd like another tour.
GID00069783	What can you tell me about REPCONN?
GID00069784	REPCONN's history.
GID00069785	Research and development.
GID00069786	Tell me about RobCo.
GID00069787	That's enough about REPCONN.
GID00069794	Thanks for the warning, but I can take care of myself.
GID00069804	Let me pass! I'll make it worth your while.
GID00069805	4f 76 65 72 72 69 64 65 20 33 32
GID00069807	If my face is recognized a second time then I must belong here.
GID00069808	I just spoke with that other robot over there.
GID00069810	ICE CREAM!
GID00069811	ICE CREAM!
GID00069812	Ice Cream
GID00069813	Ice Cream
GID00069814	Sorry, no idea.
GID00069816	You appear to have a faulty subroutine. Run diagnostics.
GID00069817	[Repair/Speech] I'm here to fix the broken wall.
GID00069821	Let's do it.
GID00069832	Goodbye.
GID00069833	Why did you leave the army?
GID00069834	Show me what you have for sale.
GID00069837	I am not supposed to go upstairs, let me pass and I won't.
GID00069838	I've worked here for years. I forgot my badge at home.
GID00069844	<Attack> I guess I'll serve as their justice then.
GID00069845	Well, they do have a few more troops than the four of you...
GID00069846	It would be safer to run and find someplace to hide.
GID00069847	It doesn't sound like things have gone to plan.
GID00069848	<Attack> Murdering deserters. Well, I think I've heard enough.
GID00069849	I imagine the NCR doesn't deal with deserters kindly.
GID00069851	Can you repair some of my stuff?
GID00069852	Can you repair some of my stuff?
GID00069853	Can you repair some of my stuff?
GID00069857	You'll do fine. Farewell, mi amigo.
GID00069859	Actually, do you want to tag along with me?
GID00069860	Actually, do you want to tag along with me?
GID00069862	It's okay by me. Enjoy your freedom.
GID00069870	I'd like to purchase something.
GID00069879	Let's get going.
GID00069880	Wait here.
GID00069881	Beagle, take a weapon.
GID00069883	The attack on the prison was a success.
GID00069885	The attack on the prison was a success.
GID00069887	Do all of the brothers use this equipment?
GID00069888	And you are?
GID00069890	Classified or not, I want to help make the attack.
GID00069892	Tell them to call off the attack on the prison, or they'll get wiped out.
GID00069894	I want to help your troops take the prison back. Believe me.
GID00069895	But I could help the troops attack the prison, you know?
GID00069897	One more question Beagle.
GID00069899	I didn't cut you loose so you could run away. Stick with me!
GID00069901	Like I cut you loose just so you could run away? Like I don't want your help?
GID00069902	If you try to run away instead of fighting at my side, I'll kill you myself.
GID00069904	Sure, run away. You don't look like you'd be much help.
GID00069907	Keep moving!
GID00069908	[You ask McNamara about himself.]
GID00069914	I sent power to McCarran and the Strip.
GID00069915	I diverted power to the grid.
GID00069916	Me send shiny juice from plant.
GID00069917	I overloaded the plant. No one will be able to use it to power a weapon.
GID00069918	Me make shiny tower boom.
GID00069922	I'm here looking for work.
GID00069923	Never mind, then.
GID00069925	I don't have 100 caps on me.
GID00069926	Here's your 100 caps.
GID00069928	It was a calculated risk. Asking questions would have tipped him off.
GID00069929	I'm pretty sure I made things better. I mean, I killed him.
GID00069932	Meyers wants to be sheriff.
GID00069934	What's at Vikki and Vance?
GID00069935	Meyers wants to sheriff Primm, and wants you to leave the town alone.
GID00069936	Forget I said anything.
GID00069937	Set up HELIOS One finale sequence, including the ARCHIMEDES laser.
GID00069940	<Lie>I heard my brother was stationed here. I want to know he's okay.
GID00069941	I'd like to go into the power plant.
GID00069942	Why are you here, and not on the front lines? Isn't that more important?
GID00069943	I was hungry and was hoping this was some kind of food factory.
GID00069944	Need food fill belly. You got food?
GID00069945	You're right, I don't have a reason.
GID00069946	I saw this place in the distance and wanted to investigate.
GID00069947	Shouldn't there be more people than this defending a power plant?
GID00069948	This is public property and I can do as I please here.
GID00069949	[Science] I notice your solar tower isn't collecting much sunlight. I can help.
GID00069951	[Attack] I'm taking over.
GID00069952	[NCR Rep] I'm with the NCR. Anything I can do to help?
GID00069953	<lie> I'm with the NCR. Anything I can do to help?
GID00069954	I'm with the NCR. Anything I can do to help?
GID00069955	You think ARCHIMEDES is a weapon they built here.
GID00069956	You think ARCHIMEDES is a weapon they built here.
GID00069957	More of a drifter.
GID00069958	Me pet aminals.
GID00069959	That's for me to know.
GID00069960	You no ask.
GID00069961	My interest in this place is scientific.
GID00069962	I is scientistic.
GID00069963	I just do what's necessary to keep the peace.
GID00069964	I no hurt nobody.
GID00069965	The NCR doesn't know about the weapon?
GID00069966	Shoulders know plant make boom?
GID00069967	The NCR asked me to help increase the plant's power output.
GID00069968	Me help shoulders make shinies warm.
GID00069969	They're looking for help getting this plant running.
GID00069970	Me fix shiny plant.
GID00069971	That's not your concern.
GID00069972	You no ask.
GID00069973	Peace.
GID00069974	Pizza.
GID00069975	I'm a soldier.
GID00069976	Me shoulder.
GID00069977	Not really. I just kind of stumbled in.
GID00069978	Nuh uh.
GID00069979	I try not to get involved.
GID00069980	Huh?
GID00069981	I want what you want.
GID00069982	I just like you is.
GID00069983	War.
GID00069984	Warm.
GID00069985	What more is there to this place than a power plant?
GID00069986	This place not just shiny juice maker?
GID00069987	Where should I route the power?
GID00069988	Where me send shiny juice?
GID00069989	Why are you here?
GID00069990	What you doing here?
GID00069991	Why would you trust me with this?
GID00069992	You help me?
GID00069993	I'm in the Brotherhood of Steel.
GID00069994	I in Brotherwood of Seal.
GID00069995	I serve Caesar.
GID00069996	[CL Rep] I with Seizure's Luncheon.
GID00069997	I'm with the NCR.
GID00069998	[NCR Rep] I with bear shoulders.
GID00069999	My only true allegiance is to myself.
GID00070000	I with me.
GID00070001	This is your turf. For all I know you could have me killed for my allegiance. Who are you with?
GID00070002	Maybe you tell me who you with so we be friends.
GID00070003	Uh... you first.
GID00070004	May I have permission to trade with your armory?
GID00070005	Sammy! Give up your plan, it'll fail!
GID00070006	Charm Pauline into Rethinking their plan.
GID00070007	That's the greatest plan I've ever heard in my entire life.
GID00070008	Your plan has critical flaws.
GID00070009	What's your plan?
GID00070010	I convinced Pauline that you shouldn't go through with this.
GID00070011	Pauline says you should give me the gun.
GID00070013	I'll see what I can do.
GID00070014	That's nice. Are you going to let me in or what?
GID00070015	Try it, I dare you. Better hope you don't miss, though.
GID00070016	I don't think I'd like that very much.
GID00070017	I know you have the gun, Sammy.
GID00070018	I know the two of you stole Vance's gun down in Primm.
GID00070019	What is your plan?
GID00070020	What's your plan?
GID00070021	Advance VMS03.
GID00070022	Tell me about the Bison Steve.
GID00070023	What about the Bison Steve hotel, across the street?
GID00070024	Tell me about Primm
GID00070025	Tell me about Primm.
GID00070026	Did you know that Vance's gun is missing?
GID00070027	Did you know that Vance's gun is missing?
GID00070028	No, the gun is missing.
GID00070029	The display case is empty. The gun's missing.
GID00070030	The gun is still missing.
GID00070031	What happened to Vance's Gun?
GID00070032	Scan your data registry. You've been hacked.
GID00070033	Maybe you've been hacked or something?
GID00070034	Ok then, let's talk about something else.
GID00070035	Let's talk about something else.
GID00070036	Let's talk about something else.
GID00070037	Tell me about the Vikki and Vance
GID00070038	Who were Vikki and Vance?
GID00070039	Why haven't you killed the ranger already?
GID00070040	Not interested. I don't do murder-for-hire.
GID00070042	No, I won't comply.
GID00070045	Okay, I'll comply.
GID00070047	It doesn't matter.
GID00070049	You must be Deputy Beagle.
GID00070050	Who are you?
GID00070051	How'd you end up being a hostage?
GID00070052	Player turns the deputy loose
GID00070053	I'll set you free now.
GID00070054	Not yet.
GID00070055	Stay put for now.
GID00070056	Stay put.
GID00070057	PC asks about the Sheriff's qualifications
GID00070058	What are the qualifications for a Sheriff?
GID00070059	PC declines to find Primm a new sheriff
GID00070060	I don't have time to help Primm.
GID00070061	PC agrees to find a new Sheriff
GID00070062	I'll help bring law and order back to Primm.
GID00070064	[Lie]You're in trouble - the NCR is sending a battalion to take this place back.
GID00070065	So, do I get a real job now or what?
GID00070066	What kind of job?
GID00070068	Tell me about Scrambler.
GID00070069	Tell me about Scrambler.
GID00070071	[Attack] You won't need to worry about bills where you're going.
GID00070072	That's right. I'm here for your job.
GID00070073	Me take your job cause me smarter.
GID00070074	How did you get this job?
GID00070075	I am now.
GID00070076	What job do you have here?
GID00070077	So you have no idea what you're doing.
GID00070078	No.
GID00070079	You pay me a stack of caps right now and I'll forget you have my job.
GID00070080	How would someone retarget the mirrors?
GID00070081	How I move shinies?
GID00070082	Settle down. I'm not here to replace anyone.
GID00070083	Actually I'm not here to replace you.
GID00070084	Settle down. I'm not here to replace anyone.
GID00070085	Why should the power go to the Strip and McCarran?
GID00070086	What are you trying to accomplish?
GID00070087	What exactly do you do?
GID00070088	Why are you worried about being replaced?
GID00070089	I just wanted to get close to you to kill you.
GID00070091	How do I make myself useful?
GID00070092	Wait! I'm not a Ranger!
GID00070093	I'm making myself useful around here. Need anything done?
GID00070095	Goodbye.
GID00070097	Sorry.
GID00070098	Sorry.
GID00070100	What do you protect your town from?
GID00070101	So you were in some gang? Were they tough?
GID00070102	So you were in a gang? Were they tough?
GID00070104	What's the deal with all the rockets down here?
GID00070105	What's the deal with all the rockets down here?
GID00070107	What "folks" were you escorting to work?
GID00070111	What's the Bison Steve?
GID00070112	What's the Bison Steve?
GID00070113	<Play Jason's Speech.>
GID00070114	That's everything, right? Let the "Great Journey" begin.
GID00070115	The rockets are set to go, right?
GID00070117	What do you cook?
GID00070121	I should be going.
GID00070123	I need to get going.
GID00070124	No thanks.
GID00070125	Did you make the training VR yourself?
GID00070126	PC will not alert Chris H
GID00070127	Well, it's none of my business.
GID00070129	You've been using Chris. It's despicable.
GID00070139	Got it.
GID00070140	Sure.
GID00070141	All right.
GID00070143	Okay.
GID00070145	Where are you located?
GID00070146	Tell me again how to find you.
GID00070148	Who are you?
GID00070151	The PC talks Chris out of sabotage
GID00070152	That'd be murder, Chris. And you're no murderer.
GID00070153	It's not a matter of smarts. You'd never forgive yourself.
GID00070154	They'd take you if they could, Chris, but you'd die.
GID00070155	They're going to revere you as a Saint, Chris!
GID00070156	That's not true, Chris. You're all right.
GID00070157	There's a little town called Novac down the road.
GID00070158	There's a little town called Novac down the road.
GID00070159	Come to think of it, sabotage is a great idea.
GID00070161	I've got some Sugar Bombs.
GID00070162	I've got some Sugar Bombs.
GID00070163	I've got some Sugar Bombs.
GID00070165	I still have questions.
GID00070167	So the "Great Journey" will use those rockets?
GID00070169	What do you do here?
GID00070170	Why don't they let you work down on the launch pad?
GID00070171	The radiation down there would kill you, Chris. Because you're human.
GID00070172	You left your Vault because you were going bald?
GID00070173	Honey, you're no monster. You're cute! Why, I could just about eat you up!
GID00070174	Jason told me himself. The Great Journey is for ghouls only. You're not going.
GID00070175	You wouldn't trust a ghoul, would you?
GID00070177	I guess I'll be going.
GID00070178	I guess I'll be going.
GID00070179	I guess I'll be going.
GID00070180	Oh, I'm not a spy.
GID00070182	I'll think about it.
GID00070184	You're pathetic. No wonder they're leaving you behind.
GID00070187	I'm already helping Chris with the rockets.
GID00070188	I killed the ghouls at REPCONN.
GID00070189	I got the ghouls to leave the area. They won't be bothering you anymore.
GID00070190	PC says what he's doing here.
GID00070191	Jason sent me down here to get rid of the "demons."
GID00070192	I'm looking for a stash of StealthBoys in this room.
GID00070193	Can I come up there and look? Maybe you missed the Stealth Boys.
GID00070194	I'm exploring, that's all. What about you?
GID00070198	I have some Stealth Boys. I could give them to you.
GID00070199	Player asks about Antler.
GID00070200	Who is "Antler"?
GID00070201	Is "Antler" the Brahmin skull over there?
GID00070202	You're taking orders from a hunk of bone!
GID00070203	PC reports way to rockets clear, all parts found
GID00070206	Start VMS01 Please
GID00070207	Set me up to Sabotage the rockets!
GID00070208	PC offers to get rid of nightkin
GID00070209	PC offers to find fuel for rockets
GID00070210	I'll track down the igniting agent.
GID00070211	I'll try to find the parts you need.
GID00070212	I'll track down the thrust control modules.
GID00070213	PC says he wants to help
GID00070214	What else do you need?
GID00070215	What else do you need?
GID00070216	What else do you need?
GID00070217	How can I help?
GID00070218	How can I help?
GID00070219	PC asks for help with different task
GID00070220	Actually, I'd like to help with something else.
GID00070221	Actually, I'd like to help with something else.
GID00070222	PC asks for task tips
GID00070223	Can you give me any tips for my current task?
GID00070224	Can you give me any tips for my current task?
GID00070225	Can you give me any tips for my current task?
GID00070226	PC will keep working on current task
GID00070227	I'll stick with my current task.
GID00070228	I just wanted to meet you.
GID00070229	What do you think of the people who live here?
GID00070230	She had it coming.
GID00070231	Jeannie May sent me.
GID00070232	Just because.
GID00070233	I killed Jeannie May. Do I still get my discount?
GID00070234	She missed my wake-up call.
GID00070235	That's my business.
GID00070236	Personal favor.
GID00070237	Seemed like a good idea at the time.
GID00070238	Where did you come from?
GID00070245	Yep, you're right. He really cares about you!
GID00070247	Harold makes unusual requests.
GID00070248	If this place has living plants, does that mean the water is safe to drink?
GID00070249	It is what it is.
GID00070250	There's tremendous risk in what you do and I bet Theo knew that.
GID00070251	Well, I hope it all works out.
GID00070252	Nah. I was just messing with ya.
GID00070253	On second thought, I think I'll pass.
GID00070255	Player tries to leave conversation.
GID00070256	I need to be going...
GID00070257	I need to go, but I'll come right back.
GID00070259	Maybe you missed it. Can I come up and look?
GID00070260	Those things out there want the stash of StealthBoys in this room.
GID00070261	Who was this "Master" you served?
GID00070262	May I have the key to the Research Safe?
GID00070263	I've got the formula for Nuka-Cola Clear.
GID00070264	I'm here to tell you Mercier is dead.
GID00070265	None of your damn business!
GID00070266	Hey, take it easy, I was just passing through.
GID00070267	Who are you and why are you talking like that?
GID00070268	What's with the masks, anyway?
GID00070269	I think you've taken a few too many blows to the head, weirdo!
GID00070270	Okay, if you say so.
GID00070271	Well, "captain", are we gonna fight or try and make a deal?
GID00070272	I think you're all crazy, and I'm getting out of here.
GID00070273	Screw it, I'm going for the faceoff!
GID00070275	Fine, I'll take it.
GID00070276	Make it 400 caps and it's all yours.
GID00070277	Can I think about it?
GID00070279	Not now. I'm busy
GID00070280	Steal your secrets? Not at all.
GID00070281	What secrets?
GID00070282	Yeah sure, I'm here for everything you got. Hand it over, zombie!
GID00070283	Ultrajet? That some sort of super chem?
GID00070284	What the heck are you talking about?
GID00070285	Stop trying to talk your way out of this, zombie!
GID00070286	Yeah sure, what do you need?
GID00070287	That's it, Butch. You and me. Right now.
GID00070288	Nothing's free in this world, Murphy.
GID00070289	No way. I'm not helping you make chems!
GID00070290	Make it 30 caps each and you got yourself a deal.
GID00070291	What's the deal with Barrett?
GID00070292	Have you ever heard of The Family?
GID00070293	Here's all the Sugar Bombs I've got.
GID00070294	Can I buy some Ultrajet?
GID00070295	Let me think about it a bit.
GID00070296	Alright, Murphy... I'm in.
GID00070297	Are you kidding? If you get out, you can have all the booze you want!
GID00070298	You're hopeless. Forget it.
GID00070305	Okay... okay. Here. No need for violence.
GID00070306	How about you pay me for it?
GID00070307	No way, it's mine!
GID00070308	Come and get it from me, if you think you can.
GID00070309	I'm keeping it, and I'd advise you to back off before I get angry!
GID00070311	Do you know someone named Grady?
GID00070312	I have a package for you from him.
GID00070313	I found him dead.
GID00070314	I bumped into him a while back is all. (Lie)
GID00070315	Sure, here you go.
GID00070316	Hang on a second. You want it, you need to pay for it.
GID00070317	I'm not giving you anything.
GID00070318	Nope, sorry. I'm holding onto it.
GID00070319	Player.RemoveItem MS04AmorousAttire 1
GID00070320	Sure, here you go and you don't owe me a single cap.
GID00070321	I'll sell it to you...for 300 caps.
GID00070329	I'm taking it direct
GID00070331	What would you have me do?
GID00070332	This conversation's over, Ms. Watts. Now step aside.
GID00070333	Who the hell are you?
GID00070334	I think you're confusing me with someone else...
GID00070335	Look, whoever this missing android is, I just want to help. Okay?
GID00070336	What I do with my own time is my own goddamn business.
GID00070337	Can I join the Railroad?
GID00070338	CitTalkAtEase.
GID00070339	CitTalkHail.
GID00070343	Zimmer thought you were an android. Don't worry, I set him straight.
GID00070344	Well... now that you know the truth. What are you going to do?
GID00070345	So what do I call you, now? Harkness or A3-21?
GID00070346	So why did you do go ahead with the change? Was it worth it?
GID00070347	Sorry Harkness, but this is the only way. Activate A3-21 Recall Code Violet.
GID00070348	Welcome back to reality, you filthy android. Activate A3-21 Recall Code Violet.
GID00070349	Sorry Harkness, but this is the only way. Activate A3-21 Recall Code Violet.
GID00070350	So why'd you help the android?
GID00070351	What do you know about this android Railroad?
GID00070352	What do you know about the Commonwealth?
GID00070353	Harkness should be told. You'd want to know if you were an android.
GID00070354	What if this evidence doesn't work? What if Harkness doesn't believe me?
GID00070355	There's something you aren't telling me. Isn't there?
GID00070356	Tell me more about you. You help androids escape?
GID00070357	So what's this stuff you gave me, these are... android guts?
GID00070358	Do you know this android personally?
GID00070359	My interest in the android is none of your business.
GID00070360	The Commonwealth? What's that?
GID00070361	Clearly I'm onto something important. What's your stake in all of this?
GID00070362	Look, I'm just trying to find out more so I can help this android.
GID00070363	I wonder who wants the android more... care to put a price on the android?
GID00070364	Really, I just kinda stumbled onto all of this. I'm mostly just curious is all.
GID00070367	I'm interested in the Love Machine Theme.
GID00070368	I'm interested in the Love Machine Theme.
GID00070371	The Nuka-Cola Corporation had her killed! (Lie)
GID00070372	Yeah, it's a shame. She was beautiful.
GID00070373	Well, you found me. Now try and kill me, tough guy.
GID00070383	Here. Have this Purified Water.
GID00070384	Here. Have this Purified Water.
GID00070385	All I have is irradiated water.
GID00070386	I'm sorry. I don't have any water to give you.
GID00070387	What, just give it to you? Hell no.
GID00070388	I insist, my friend. It's the least I can do to help.
GID00070389	No. Find your own water.
GID00070390	Nevermind.
GID00070391	Let's talk about something else.
GID00070392	About those Treeminders...
GID00070393	Did you ever ask one of them to kill you?
GID00070394	How do the Treeminders normally handle other Outsiders?
GID00070395	Which Treeminder do you get along with the best?
GID00070397	You've become an important part of their life. Without you, they're lost.
GID00070398	I'm not the killing type.
GID00070399	You're obviously crazier than they are. Why would I listen to you?
GID00070400	I've got to go now.
GID00070401	What book?
GID00070402	Just be glad you're still alive.
GID00070403	Actually, I helped write that book.
GID00070404	I'm sorry to hear that. Is it really that bad?
GID00070405	Maybe the book's fine, and you're just an idiot.
GID00070406	Book? What book?
GID00070407	Oh, I am hunting. I'm hunting what you've got.
GID00070408	Two meals a day doesn't sound like much.
GID00070409	Actually, I helped write that book.
GID00070410	Why are you so happy?
GID00070411	You must be crazy. It's never a good day out here.
GID00070412	Read it? I helped write it!
GID00070413	No. Why don't you tell me about it? <Lie>
GID00070414	I never meant it like all that. It's just supposed to help you stay alive.
GID00070415	Blessings to you, too. Surely, you would care to give a tithe for that wisdom?
GID00070417	Good to see you, Susie! Looks like you're doing well.
GID00070418	I never expected to see you out here, either. I'm surprised you're alive.
GID00070419	So, does that mean I can come back?
GID00070420	Doesn't really make a difference to me. I was exiled, remember?
GID00070421	I miss her, too. Give my warmest regards to the Vault, would you?
GID00070422	Well, don't let me hold you up.
GID00070423	Fine, I like it better up here than I ever did down there.
GID00070424	What's with those things behind the glass?
GID00070425	Can you explain how the My First Infirmary works?
GID00070427	What does my Jukebox do?
GID00070428	Can you explain how the My First Laboratory works?
GID00070429	What does the Nuka-Cola machine dispense?
GID00070430	Can you explain what the Workbench is for?
GID00070431	How is it better than a regular Nuka-Cola?
GID00070432	You got any snake oil in there as well?
GID00070433	I'll take it for 50 caps.
GID00070434	Sure, I'll take it!
GID00070435	No, thanks.
GID00070436	My mistake. I thought you were someone else.
GID00070437	I've been worried about you. You don't exactly seem cut out for this place.
GID00070438	Happy? Sure, I guess you could call it that.
GID00070439	Life sucks, then you die. You may as well get that through your thick skull.
GID00070440	What is it? What did you see?
GID00070441	What are you, crazy or something?
GID00070442	The Wasteland is as dead as you're going to be if you don't tell me the truth!
GID00070443	Calm down! Let me try and help you.
GID00070444	Who's burning what?
GID00070445	Shut up and make some sense!
GID00070446	Donovan! What are you doing in these parts?
GID00070447	No problem. What are you doing out here?
GID00070448	What are you doing, following me?
GID00070449	I don't know what to say. What do I owe ya?
GID00070450	Wow, thanks!
GID00070451	Now that's what I call payment.
GID00070452	Where can I buy more things for my place?
GID00070455	Hey, it's none of my business.
GID00070459	Who are you?
GID00070464	Sorry, I didn't expect to bump into anyone alive down here.
GID00070465	I'd be glad to help him. Who is he?
GID00070466	Wilks? I have no idea what you mean.
GID00070467	Who the hell is Bryan Wilks?
GID00070468	How the heck can an ant breathe fire?
GID00070469	Can't you take responsibility for his father's death?
GID00070470	Don't you realize you've ruined his entire life?
GID00070471	You should have at least told him you were alive. He thought he was alone.
GID00070475	Hold on. You're in the Tunnel Snakes? You guys really do rule!
GID00070476	If you're talking about the Fire Ants, I'm already working on it.
GID00070477	Sorry, kid. Help costs caps, and you look pretty broke to me.
GID00070478	I got my own problems right now, kid.
GID00070479	Hey, are you okay? You shouldn't be alone in a place like this.
GID00070480	Calm down, calm down. Just who the heck are you?
GID00070481	That's wonderful, kid. Now scram.
GID00070484	So tell me about the Commonwealth.
GID00070485	It's not real blood, Harkness. It's synthetic, just like everything else.
GID00070486	You were made to look and act human. But you're not. The evidence proves that.
GID00070487	I'm sorry about this, I really am. But it's true. You're not human.
GID00070494	What are you doing here in this wrecked part of the ship?
GID00070495	What kind of work do you do in here?
GID00070496	Actually, I give up. I can't find anywhere that will take you in.
GID00070497	I found a place with lots of kids your age. I'll tell you how to get there.
GID00070498	Sure did. It's a beautiful place called Paradise Falls. Here, put this on.
GID00070499	It's a Paradise Welcome Necklace. It'll help you find your way, you lucky devil!
GID00070500	Something to remember me by. It'll lead you home.
GID00070501	It's a slave collar, I sold your dumb ass for caps.
GID00070502	I sure did, Bryan. Vera said she'd take you in!
GID00070503	All the ants are dead so I'm done here. Go home.
GID00070504	Don't worry, Bryan... I think I know how to take care of these ants.
GID00070505	I know where the Ant Queen lives.
GID00070506	Haven't found a thing. (Lie)
GID00070507	It was for the greater good Lesko. Man is not ready to play God.
GID00070508	Your theories were in error, and beyond correction. I had no choice.
GID00070509	I can't let you risk people's lives for an experiment.
GID00070510	Because you're out of your mind!
GID00070511	Just how will all this undo the mayhem you've caused?
GID00070512	This will stop the Fire Ants?
GID00070513	I hope that's everything, I've had enough of ants.
GID00070514	Mutagenic Bio-what?
GID00070515	I've killed all the Nest Guardians.
GID00070516	I've killed all the Nest Guardians [Lie]
GID00070517	I've killed all of the Nest Guardians, but I destroyed your mutagen supply.
GID00070518	I've destroyed your mutagen sample.
GID00070519	Actually, my mistake... I'm not done yet.
GID00070520	I've killed the Ant Queen and I destroyed your mutagen supply.
GID00070521	I'd like the Ant Sight to increase my perception.
GID00070522	I'd like the Ant Might to increase my physical strength.
GID00070523	Actually, I'm not ready yet.
GID00070524	Did your pappa ever tell you what he thought of Lesko?
GID00070525	Before Lesko showed up, were there ever ants in Grayditch?
GID00070526	Do you trust Lesko?
GID00070527	I found him, actually... inside Marigold Metro.
GID00070529	You know what, keep your caps and I'll tell Moriarty you're gone.
GID00070534	Why don't you just forget about it and clear on out of here?
GID00070535	What can I do to help?
GID00070536	What exactly do you need?
GID00070537	So? It's your mistake Doc, you fix it.
GID00070538	If the Queen's your concern, why not deal with it directly?
GID00070539	Why not just kill the Queen and be done with it?
GID00070540	So you want me to pop the Queen, huh?
GID00070541	No reward needed Doc, I'll be glad to help.
GID00070542	This is a hefty task, Doc. I'm going to need serious incentive.
GID00070543	Books aren't going to buy me new ammunition.
GID00070544	You want help? Fork over some caps, Einstein.
GID00070545	Mind if I ask about some of the people who lived here?
GID00070546	Tell me about this "Doc Lesko."
GID00070547	Tell me about the Brandice Family.
GID00070548	About the other people from Grayditch...
GID00070549	Where did the Brandices live?
GID00070550	So, you and Will were good friends?
GID00070551	How about Will's parents?
GID00070552	Will's dad was scary? How so?
GID00070553	Look, anything else you can do to help might save lives.
GID00070554	Is there anyone on this ship named Pinkerton?
GID00070555	I understand. Goodbye, Amata.
GID00070556	I saved the Vault, and now you're kicking me out?
GID00070559	Your team's still alive... I heard their distress signal!
GID00070560	Tell me what's going on and I'll see if I can help.
GID00070561	Start from the beginning.
GID00070562	Sorry, sounds like suicide. Be my guest.
GID00070564	Where can I rent a bed?
GID00070565	Tell me about the rebels.
GID00070566	Tell me about the Rebels.
GID00070567	What happened down here?
GID00070573	I'd like a haircut please.
GID00070574	I'm not a charity. You want to die, cough up some caps.
GID00070575	You're mostly a tree, right? Can't I just burn you down?
GID00070576	Let's trade.
GID00070577	Is there someplace I can sleep?
GID00070578	Looks like I'm breaking you out of your cell...
GID00070579	Are you a prisoner here or something?
GID00070580	Who the hell are you supposed to be?
GID00070581	Sorry, pal. Vance is worm food.
GID00070582	Calm down, Ian. Tell me everything from the beginning.
GID00070583	I have no clue what you're talking about.
GID00070584	What the hell is your problem?
GID00070585	Wait, you're Ian West? I have this letter for you from your sister!
GID00070586	I saw the Family's mark on the wall. What's up with that?
GID00070587	Let's talk about something else.
GID00070588	When did you first discover you had the hunger?
GID00070589	What did Lucy say she saw you do to that Wastelander?
GID00070590	Did you ever talk to your parents about it?
GID00070591	Do you really believe in vampires?
GID00070592	Can you heal my radiation?
GID00070593	No, thanks.
GID00070594	Do it.
GID00070595	Here's your 100 caps. Do it.
GID00070596	Here's your 100 caps. Do it.
GID00070597	Here's your 100 caps. Do it.
GID00070598	Here's your 100 caps. Do it.
GID00070599	I don't have 100 caps.
GID00070600	I don't have 100 caps.
GID00070601	I don't have 100 caps.
GID00070602	Sorry, I don't have 100 caps.
GID00070603	Here's your 100 caps. Do it.
GID00070604	Sorry, I don't have 100 caps.
GID00070605	I don't have 100 caps.
GID00070607	On second thought, stick with me for a little longer.
GID00070608	On second thought, stay with me.
GID00070609	Actually I changed my mind. Let's stick together.
GID00070610	On second thought, you've been pretty useful so far. Forget what I said.
GID00070611	<Companion Protocol::Continue Companion Protocol>
GID00070612	Yes, I'm sure.
GID00070613	Yeah, that's what I think. You should head back home.
GID00070614	I think it's for the best.
GID00070615	I just think we should right now.
GID00070616	<Companion Protocol::End Companion Protocol>
GID00070617	I'll miss you too, Lily, but it's time.
GID00070633	Hey, I've been there! Those Super Mutants are all dead. It's safe now.
GID00070634	You can release the prisoners. I promise they're no threat.
GID00070635	Are you all right? You sound... strange.
GID00070636	Yes, unfortunately.
GID00070638	You should come with me. It's not safe for you to stay.
GID00070640	You could come with me, you know. Leave this place behind forever.
GID00070641	Goodbye, Amata. It's time for me to go.
GID00070642	The door's open. You could come with me.
GID00070643	Time for me to go, Amata. My Dad's out there somewhere.
GID00070644	Why not come with me? There's nothing here for you anymore.
GID00070646	Can I see what you have to trade?
GID00070647	Go get them yourself, then.
GID00070649	Chris said you might know where I can find computer parts.
GID00070650	Where did you say I might find some computer parts again?
GID00070651	Any idea where I might be able to find nuclear material?
GID00070652	Any thoughts on where I might find some computer parts?
GID00070653	Why don't you come with me?
GID00070657	Fine, here's your 100 caps.
GID00070658	Yeah, yeah. Here, take your 100 caps. I hope you choke on them.
GID00070659	Forget it. I'll come back.
GID00070660	Wait a second! I handled Silver for you, and you still want me to pay?
GID00070664	Okay.
GID00070665	PC says goodbye to hostage
GID00070666	I've got to get going.
GID00070667	See you later.
GID00070671	That's right - you SHOULD thank me.
GID00070673	What's your problem now?
GID00070674	What's your problem now?
GID00070675	What's your problem now?
GID00070677	What are you talking about? You're the sheriff now!
GID00070679	I'll be going now.
GID00070680	Goodbye.
GID00070681	Goodbye.
GID00070683	I'm still looking.
GID00070685	What is this place?
GID00070687	Who are you?
GID00070689	I haven't found the gun.
GID00070691	I found the gun. Here it is.
GID00070693	Another time, maybe.
GID00070695	Tell me the whole story of Vikki and Vance.
GID00070696	Tell me about Vikki and Vance again.
GID00070698	Who are you?
GID00070700	You sound pretty tough. Why haven't I heard of you two before?
GID00070702	Who are you?
GID00070704	You sound pretty tough. I wonder why I've never heard of you.
GID00070706	I know the two of you stole Vance's gun down in Primm.
GID00070708	Your plan is going to get you both killed.
GID00070710	You say Powder Gangers kidnapped Primm's deputy?
GID00070711	I rescued Deputy Beagle.
GID00070712	I freed Deputy Beagle and killed the Powder Gangers.
GID00070713	I'll find Primm a new sheriff.
GID00070718	All right. I'm going to go have a look around.
GID00070720	He's working in a bar in Megaton.
GID00070721	He works for a guy up in Megaton. I think he might be a slave.
GID00070722	You run this place with Greta?
GID00070723	What do you know about Underworld?
GID00070724	You don't get a lot of customers, do you?
GID00070725	Do you know anything about Underworld?
GID00070726	What was this place before the Ghouls moved in?
GID00070727	How did all of the Ghouls end up here?
GID00070728	Isn't it dangerous being this deep into the city?
GID00070729	That's all I needed to know.
GID00070731	This souvenir rocket I have glows. Will it serve as fuel?
GID00070732	How can I help get you out of this room?
GID00070733	Looks like I have to kill you.
GID00070734	Your friends are safe. I just helped them sneak out of here.
GID00070735	How did you end up trapped down here?
GID00070736	How have you survived?
GID00070737	You don't look like the other ghouls from Bright's group.
GID00070738	What can you tell me about the "demons"?
GID00070739	What can you tell me about the creatures out there?
GID00070740	I need to search this room.
GID00070741	I haven't found her yet.
GID00070742	Advance the Chupacabra quest.
GID00070748	How is business lately?
GID00070749	Did you get a look at the attacker?
GID00070750	I heard you've been losing livestock.
GID00070751	No one is going to attack your corral from now on.
GID00070752	Not yet.
GID00070753	I'll see if I can catch whoever's responsible.
GID00070754	What do you do here in Novac?
GID00070762	Can we talk about something else?
GID00070765	What can you tell me about the Lyons' Pride?
GID00070766	Are you in charge of the um... the robot?
GID00070769	What is this place?
GID00070770	We can talk from this distance.
GID00070771	<Glare at No-bark>
GID00070772	If you're going to be weird, I'm just going to leave.
GID00070773	I have to go now.
GID00070774	I don't mean any harm.
GID00070775	Talk about what?
GID00070776	Who tried to make you talk?
GID00070777	You're going to talk whether you like it or not.
GID00070778	You're going to talk whether you like it or not.
GID00070779	You said you'd stab me with that dirty knife.
GID00070781	Why do they call you No-bark?
GID00070782	How did No-bark get his name?
GID00070783	Who was it?
GID00070784	Has anybody been acting strange lately?
GID00070785	Who do you think is actually at the factory?
GID00070786	What do you know about the abduction of Boone's wife?
GID00070787	What else do you know about the deaths at the corral?
GID00070788	What's been going on in town?
GID00070789	Is anything interesting happening in the area?
GID00070790	Let's talk about something else.
GID00070791	So... Any thoughts on the Enclave?
GID00070792	Care to share anything about the Super Mutants?
GID00070793	Hey, can you hook me up with some chems?
GID00070794	I need medical supplies.
GID00070795	What about the Brotherhood's history in this area?
GID00070796	Aren't you a little young for all this?
GID00070797	Why did you damage me? You're supposed to be a healing robot!
GID00070807	Let's talk about something else.
GID00070808	What do you know about the Enclave?
GID00070809	The Super Mutants are coming from Vault 87. It's their breeding ground.
GID00070810	Anything you can tell me about the Super Mutants?
GID00070813	Yes... I recovered it all by myself.
GID00070814	Yes... but I had a little help from Sydney.
GID00070815	Yes... but I had a little help from Sydney. She didn't make it, though.
GID00070816	Nah, I was just kidding.
GID00070817	That's all for now, I guess.
GID00070819	Since we're done now, why don't you tell me about yourself?
GID00070820	How did you get into the relic hunting business?
GID00070821	You recovered all of that stuff in the Preservation Society's museum?
GID00070822	Nice gun. I've never seen one like that.
GID00070824	So, whatever happened to your father?
GID00070827	I'm looking for someone named Abraham Washington.
GID00070828	Nice gun. I've never seen one like that.
GID00070829	What happened to your father?
GID00070830	Who's Abraham Washington?
GID00070831	Are you related to Henry Young?
GID00070832	I'd like to report someone.
GID00070833	What do you people do here all day?
GID00070842	Tenpenny is dead. I watched his brains splatter. <Lie.>
GID00070846	What did you and Boone's wife argue about?
GID00070847	Who's Boone?
GID00070848	Why are you on bad terms with Boone?
GID00070849	Certainly. Thank you.
GID00070850	If it means that much to you, I'll take it.
GID00070852	Hey, thanks. Keep it coming.
GID00070853	Right on. Thanks.
GID00070856	Let me see your Chems.
GID00070857	Vampires can drink any kind of human blood... even from bloodpacks.
GID00070858	Can I get into the Ranger Compound?
GID00070860	I wouldn't worry about it. They're probably just rumors.
GID00070861	Too many men are sitting around. Put extra guards on watch.
GID00070862	I'd put some men with rifles on the guard towers.
GID00070864	I don't have time to deal with this.
GID00070865	What are you doing wandering around out here?
GID00070866	What is Underworld?
GID00070867	Well, you're dead meat now. Give me all your stuff.
GID00070870	Why did you kill that bartender?
GID00070871	That's enough about them.
GID00070874	I've been thinking about getting into the trade. You need a dog catcher?
GID00070875	Can you give me a haircut?
GID00070876	Let me ask you about something else.
GID00070877	I'll go for the armor.
GID00070878	The Minigun is more my speed.
GID00070879	Got anything else?
GID00070880	Where can I get some more ammo around here?
GID00070881	Got anything for these injuries?
GID00070887	I was just exploring the area and noticed your patrol coming out of here.
GID00070888	The ranger won't be a problem. He's dead.
GID00070889	He told me himself that no one knew where he was.
GID00070890	I'm not sure.
GID00070891	The ranger won't be a problem. He's gone.
GID00070892	I can take care of the Ranger.
GID00070894	Got anything you need help with?
GID00070897	I'll just be going...
GID00070898	I'm not a powder ganger.
GID00070899	I'm not a powder ganger!
GID00070900	I'm not a powder ganger!
GID00070903	Keep pointing that gun at me and I'll stick it up your ass.
GID00070904	Keep pointing that gun at me and I'll stick it up your ass.
GID00070905	Don't point! It's rude! Especially with guns!
GID00070915	You're a fool to pass up a chance at love with Angela.
GID00070916	You don't have to be such a bitch...
GID00070917	There are no bad children. Only bad parents.
GID00070918	Is that your son running around here?
GID00070919	I've got some stuff that needs repairs.
GID00070928	Heard any good stories lately?
GID00070929	Whoa! Slow down, lady. You're freaking me out.
GID00070930	I like you. You're funny. I assume you sell Chems?
GID00070931	Got any Chems? I could really use a fix.
GID00070932	This place looks pretty easy to rob. You have any problems with thieves?
GID00070933	Aren't you afraid someone will use your own guns to rob you?
GID00070934	Do you have the big stuff? Flamers, Missile Launchers, stuff like that?
GID00070935	This is quite a selection, but they're all in lousy condition.
GID00070936	Cute names. Did you make them up, or are you just trying to look tough?
GID00070937	This peashooter has saved my ass more than once.
GID00070938	How do I know your slop is even edible?
GID00070939	I am getting a bit hungry.
GID00070940	I hunt for my own food.
GID00070941	Hey, it's none of my business. Let the past be the past.
GID00070942	Lady, you're nuts.
GID00070943	Who's this Sister? A nun?
GID00070944	Anything? Chems? Guns? How about parts and junk?
GID00070945	Just what the Wasteland needs, another junk vendor...
GID00070946	How do I know you won't rip me off?
GID00070947	You got a T-51b? No? Then you don't have everything.
GID00070948	Thank God! I can barely carry all this stuff.
GID00070949	Know where I can offload some guns?
GID00070950	You some sort of tough guy? You want to try me?
GID00070951	What's your problem? Loosen up, pal.
GID00070952	Sounds like a plan, man.
GID00070953	I know your type. You're a freeloader and a waste of breath.
GID00070955	Seagrave? Oh yeah. He's clueless.
GID00070956	Whoever this Seagrave is, you think he's a threat to your influence?
GID00070957	It's really none of my business.
GID00070959	I found a letter in Seagrave's room. It's from some Slavers...
GID00070961	Bannon is trying to blackmail Seagraves Holmes.
GID00070962	I found this letter in Seagrave's room. I thought you should see it.
GID00070963	I'm partial to Mirelurk Cakes myself.
GID00070964	Mirelurk gives me gas. I'd rather have squirrel.
GID00070965	You're a junkie? Tell me where you keep your stash. Now!
GID00070967	Bannon tells me you're trying to steal his Council seat.
GID00070968	Man, I love guns. Nothing's better than the kick of a .44!
GID00070969	Any fool can use a gun.
GID00070976	What was all that about? Who were those people?
GID00070977	You seem to be pretty calm, considering there was just war in your streets.
GID00070978	I'm just passing through. Don't bug me with your problems.
GID00070979	I have the Declaration of Independence.
GID00070983	That's all I wanted to know.
GID00070984	How long have you been here?
GID00070985	I'd like to know more about the Brotherhood of Steel.
GID00070986	If you're just a part of the Brotherhood, where's the rest of it?
GID00070987	Those sound like pretty good changes to me.
GID00070988	It must be difficult to communicate with the West Coast.
GID00070989	Why, what happened?
GID00070990	He's in charge, so it's his decision, right?
GID00070991	Sorry. Never mind.
GID00070992	Sorry to have brought it up.
GID00070993	You make saving people sound like a bad thing.
GID00070994	I'd like to hear what you have to say anyway.
GID00070995	What kind of changes?
GID00070996	What do you mean by "repercussions"?
GID00070997	Then where's the rest of the Brotherhood?
GID00070998	Well, I'm asking you. Why are you here?
GID00070999	But not everyone agrees?
GID00071000	Why is that a sore subject?
GID00071001	Why are you the wrong person to ask?
GID00071002	Why are you here in the Capital Wasteland?
GID00071003	Why do you want the suit?
GID00071026	You'll live, tough girl.
GID00071032	I sabotaged the rockets.
GID00071034	It was some sort of mechanical failure.
GID00071036	I'm not going to hand over everything I own to you and your tin can friends.
GID00071038	Let's talk this over.
GID00071040	What's going on here?
GID00071042	How do I join the Brotherhood of Steel?
GID00071045	I'll speak to your Elder. Lead the way.
GID00071047	Hello?
GID00071048	Is anyone there?
GID00071049	Anyone home?
GID00071050	Guess I'll just see myself out.
GID00071051	The password is "Lives to fight another day."
GID00071053	Sorry, I just wandered in here. I'm lost.
GID00071056	Let me guess, you thought I was from the Family.
GID00071057	Yeah, I know about them.
GID00071058	I was hoping to find out what the Family did here.
GID00071059	Look, maybe you better explain what's going on first.
GID00071060	No, I lied. I'm their newest member!
GID00071061	I delivered the letter to Ian.
GID00071062	Evan King sent me to look for you.
GID00071063	You're tough to find.
GID00071064	No time to discuss it. We're getting the heck out of here!
GID00071065	Vance is dead, Ian. I'm so sorry.
GID00071066	Well, Vance isn't going to be able to help anymore.
GID00071067	Sorry, pal. Vance is worm food.
GID00071068	Look, this place isn't the answer. You need to go home and face your demons.
GID00071069	If you want to stay, then stay. You have to do what you feel is right.
GID00071070	Do what you want. This is a waste of time.
GID00071071	Read this letter, Ian. Lucy wrote it. I bet that would change your mind.
GID00071072	Read this letter, Ian. Lucy wrote it. I bet that would change your mind.
GID00071073	I changed my mind, Ian. I think you should stay here.
GID00071074	Nothing I can say will change your mind will it?
GID00071075	Never mind.
GID00071076	Come on, it will really throw those guys for a loop if you tell me.
GID00071077	Can't we work something out? Maybe share the winnings?
GID00071078	Never mind.
GID00071079	You never did tell me what I'd win.
GID00071080	It's Irving.
GID00071081	On second thought... I think I'll keep it to myself.
GID00071082	Never mind.
GID00071083	I don't have any.
GID00071084	I have 1 radscorpion gland.
GID00071085	I have one radscorpion gland.
GID00071086	I have 3 glands.
GID00071087	I've got a few radscorpion glands.
GID00071088	I have a bunch.
GID00071089	I have a bunch of radscorpion glands.
GID00071090	I have some radscorpion glands. Can you make me some casserole?
GID00071091	I'd like some of that radscorpion venom casserole.
GID00071092	What happened to Primm?
GID00071093	Do you have anything for sale?
GID00071094	What's going on in Primm?
GID00071095	How's Primm these days?
GID00071096	How's Primm these days?
GID00071101	Where can I find Joseph?
GID00071102	Stay here. Maybe I'll come back for you.
GID00071103	My Dad told me we were born in Vault 101...
GID00071104	Oh, I wasn't born in the Vault? That's complete bullshit, and you know it.
GID00071105	You're wrong. My Dad never would have lied to me.
GID00071106	You're a liar, Moriarty. I know where I grew up.
GID00071107	100 caps!? Are you nuts? I don't have that kind of money!
GID00071114	What can you tell me about the prison?
GID00071115	I'd like to come in.
GID00071116	No, you'll need it more than I will.
GID00071117	I'll take that. Now get out of here.
GID00071119	Where can I get a stiff drink?
GID00071121	Mister Crowley wants that key. Now.
GID00071123	Yes, and he says you owe him some caps.
GID00071124	Just hand over the caps, and I'll be out of your way.
GID00071125	I don't deal with junkies. Hand over all your caps. Now!
GID00071126	Slow down. Tell me your side of the story.
GID00071127	Look, just give me the caps and I'll tell him you're gone.
GID00071128	I don't care. I'm just here for caps.
GID00071129	Look, just give me some of your caps, and I'll tell him you're gone.
GID00071130	I don't know. Maybe Moriarty's right and you're just a junkie.
GID00071131	Who's Moriarty?
GID00071132	Whoa, calm down... Who the hell is Moriarty?
GID00071133	You'd better calm down, before I put you down.
GID00071134	You don't still offer your... services, do you?
GID00071135	What will you do now?
GID00071136	I don't have 100 caps.
GID00071137	Look, I need a way to get some caps or I'll never have the money to pay you.
GID00071142	Find ammo, boy!
GID00071143	Find chems, boy!
GID00071144	Never mind.
GID00071145	Find some food, boy!
GID00071146	Find me a weapon, boy!
GID00071149	Follow me.
GID00071151	Wait here.
GID00071154	Shoo, dog. Get out of here.
GID00071155	Fine, be that way.
GID00071156	Okay, I'll leave. You stay here.
GID00071157	In that case, just die.
GID00071159	Dukov has a special key. Get it for me and I'll take you to Rivet City.
GID00071160	What's the matter, boy? Lose your master?
GID00071161	You know, I think you're the first dog I've met that didn't try to eat me.
GID00071162	Shut up, mutt.
GID00071163	You're pretty friendly, aren't you, boy?
GID00071164	Good teeth, strong claws. You're a fighting dog, aren't you?
GID00071165	Mutts that don't shut up get eaten. See if I'm kidding.
GID00071166	Been a while since I tasted dog meat. Now, play dead. Forever.
GID00071167	Looks like you've got some fight left in you, yet. That's a good sign.
GID00071168	I know how you feel. I lost my Dad.
GID00071169	Want to come with me? It's dangerous out here all alone.
GID00071170	Don't worry, boy. You get used to losing people out here.
GID00071171	Sounds like a good plan. Let's get out of here!
GID00071172	That sounds awfully complicated. Why can't I just get out the normal way?
GID00071173	What makes you think this tunnel won't be guarded? It could be a trap...
GID00071174	Keying on Meyers' experience, the player asks him to sheriff Primm
GID00071175	Actually, I have some stuff to take care of first.
GID00071176	The PC tells Meyers to become sheriff
GID00071185	Let me ask you about something else.
GID00071186	You seem kind of addicted to the stuff... Is it safe to drink?
GID00071187	Yes, quite lovely. Um... I've got to go.
GID00071188	Ian's dead. I killed him!
GID00071189	I'm not here to take sides, just to make sure Vance hasn't omitted any facts.
GID00071195	Enough talk! I'm here to wipe your kind out!
GID00071200	What are you doing in Underworld?
GID00071201	No thanks, I think I'll hold onto it.
GID00071202	Would you be interested in buying this Stradivarius violin for the museum?
GID00071203	Sounds like a deal. Here you go.
GID00071204	Sounds like a deal. Here you go.
GID00071205	Is there anything else you're looking for?
GID00071207	PC asks Hayes to establish law in Primm
GID00071208	Primm is in dire need of some real law.
GID00071209	I'd like to talk to you about protecting Primm.
GID00071210	I got extra troop support for Primm.
GID00071211	I want to talk about that NCR protecting Primm.
GID00071212	The PC has briefed McGee
GID00071213	Tell me about the NCR
GID00071214	Never mind, I'll find someone else.
GID00071215	I'll look for another solution.
GID00071216	What are you doing out here?
GID00071217	What are you doing out here?
GID00071218	General information about McGee personally
GID00071219	Where are you from?
GID00071220	Want to be sheriff?
GID00071221	What's the news?
GID00071222	Powder Gangers have taken over Primm.
GID00071223	I rescued Primm's deputy, but the town's still lawless.
GID00071236	If you want the suit, you'll have to take it from me.
GID00071237	Here, you can have it. Just move on and leave Canterbury alone.
GID00071238	Is the museum looking to acquire anything else?
GID00071239	Any interest in partnering up again?
GID00071242	For that price, I'll deal with it, myself.
GID00071255	What makes her so special?
GID00071256	I guess your old master must have taken pretty good care of you.
GID00071257	I can be your new master. Would you like that, boy?
GID00071258	Come with me, dog. It'll be good to have some company out here.
GID00071259	I could use a pet like you. Let's go find something to eat, mutt.
GID00071260	Why would I want your used up hand-me-down?
GID00071264	Here, I've got three stealthboys.
GID00071265	Harland sent me. I'm here to get you out of here.
GID00071266	Who are you?
GID00071270	It was the closest to proof that there was.
GID00071271	Come with me. Let's go after the Legion.
GID00071272	The culprit was obvious when all the pieces fell into place.
GID00071273	I deduced it with a simple process of elimination.
GID00071274	What will you do after this?
GID00071275	We'll kill more with two of us.
GID00071276	You needed someone to blame. What does it matter who?
GID00071277	Are you an outlaw now?
GID00071278	Snipers work better in pairs.
GID00071279	I thought snipers worked in teams.
GID00071280	You're right. I don't.
GID00071281	Advance the sniper quest.
GID00071282	What do you do here?
GID00071283	Are you going to try and kill me?
GID00071284	I just wanted to check out the view.
GID00071285	I didn't say I wanted to be your friend.
GID00071286	I don't see how that affects me.
GID00071287	I found the bill of sale.
GID00071288	Just making friendly conversation.
GID00071289	How do you know your wife is dead?
GID00071290	No reason.
GID00071291	Just a hunch.
GID00071292	I'm leaving.
GID00071293	Just looking around.
GID00071294	I'm meeting new people.
GID00071295	No.
GID00071296	Well, I'm not from here.
GID00071297	You only trust strangers?
GID00071298	I heard there was a sniper nest up here.
GID00071299	His story didn't add up.
GID00071300	His story didn't add up.
GID00071301	Her story didn't add up.
GID00071302	There's a sniper.
GID00071303	You're trying to track down your wife?
GID00071304	Do you treat everyone around here like this?
GID00071305	Expecting visitors?
GID00071306	Expecting visitors?
GID00071307	I just wanted you to kill him.
GID00071308	I just wanted you to kill him.
GID00071309	I just wanted you to kill her.
GID00071310	What do you want me to do?
GID00071311	So now you want something from me.
GID00071312	What do I do if I find this person?
GID00071313	What was I supposed to do again?
GID00071314	Why is that?
GID00071315	I think I'm in the wrong place.
GID00071316	Yes.
GID00071317	Could you repair my equipment?
GID00071318	Okay, Dad. Wish me luck.
GID00071319	I think I'll tough it out.
GID00071320	Yes, cure me.
GID00071321	Yes, cure me. Here's 50 caps.
GID00071322	Yes, cure me. Here's 50 caps.
GID00071323	Yes, cure me. Here's 50 caps.
GID00071324	I can't afford treatment. I don't have 50 caps.
GID00071325	I can't afford treatment. I don't have 50 caps.
GID00071326	Yes, cure me. Here's 50 caps.
GID00071327	I can't afford treatment. I don't have 50 caps.
GID00071328	I don't have 50 caps.
GID00071329	What do you know about the AntAgonizer?
GID00071333	What do you know about the Mechanist?
GID00071337	Let's talk about something else.
GID00071338	What is this place?
GID00071343	No, I only found the parents' bodies.
GID00071344	Nope, and it's unlikely they left him alive.
GID00071345	No, and enough with the third degree already!
GID00071348	How dare you insult my taste in clothes.
GID00071349	So I'm not good enough to shop here?
GID00071350	I see you are also a person of refinement.
GID00071351	This place is real dump.
GID00071352	Nice place you have here.
GID00071353	Is this swill even safe to drink?
GID00071354	Relax. I'm just looking around.
GID00071355	Damn! You sound like you've been sampling your own stuff.
GID00071356	Did you know that Paulie Cantelli is an addict?
GID00071361	I'd like to buy a robot.
GID00071371	Let me see what you have.
GID00071372	You seem friendly enough.
GID00071373	Who's running the place now?
GID00071374	If there's been a breakout, why is anyone still here?
GID00071375	Why don't you leave?
GID00071376	No, he wasn't with the Family. <Lie.>
GID00071377	Sorry, but Ian's dead. <Lie.>
GID00071378	He's fine. He's living with Lucy now. <Lie.>
GID00071379	Next time you shoot at me like that, you'd better not miss.
GID00071380	Oh come on, it's just gang nonsense.
GID00071381	You ever take one of them out?
GID00071382	Tell me how to see Ian and maybe we can talk... in private.
GID00071383	Come on, all I want to do is talk. What harm could little old me do?
GID00071384	Hey, I'm just here to help. All I want to do is be someone he can talk to.
GID00071385	Maybe it will, or maybe it's just messing him up more.
GID00071386	Sorry, I think he needs to be with his real family.
GID00071387	Hey, hot stuff. Why don't you tell me how I can see Ian?
GID00071388	I'm here to take you home, Ian.
GID00071389	You seem awfully troubled, Ian. What did you do...
GID00071390	I know what you did. Vance told me everything.
GID00071391	It doesn't matter what happened in the past.
GID00071392	Get a hold of yourself!
GID00071393	Let's go home, Ian. The only way to beat your nightmares is to face them.
GID00071394	I didn't find his body.
GID00071395	He's probably dead too.
GID00071396	Maybe. Who wants to know?
GID00071397	Who else lives in Arefu?
GID00071398	Is there anything dangerous around there I should know about?
GID00071424	What about supplies? And guns? Do you sell those?
GID00071425	Jeannie May sent me.
GID00071459	Can I pick up some supplies?
GID00071460	What happened here?
GID00071461	What were you in for?
GID00071462	I can only spare 10 caps.
GID00071463	I'd like to donate 100 caps.
GID00071464	I have 50 caps I can donate.
GID00071465	Caps? Oh. I thought I could give you some items...
GID00071466	I'd like to make a donation to the church.
GID00071467	You're on your own, kid. You're the one who decided to run away.
GID00071468	Um... yeah. Well, look at the time. I have to go now...
GID00071469	Private, there's a security emergency on the flight deck! <Lie>
GID00071470	Would you be interested in trading with a Vault?
GID00071477	Fuck off. I'm not going to help you.
GID00071478	There is no stockpile of Stealth Boys in this building.
GID00071479	Did you do something to your leg?
GID00071480	What happened?
GID00071481	I'll come back when I know more.
GID00071482	I'm not interested in this town's problems.
GID00071483	The Rangers are soft. They're probably already dead.
GID00071484	<Lie> The attackers are all dead too. It's impossible to identify them.
GID00071485	I don't know the details. I just saw a lot of dead rangers.
GID00071486	Members of Caesar's Legion ambushed them.
GID00071487	Show me.
GID00071488	Your body is injured, not your mind. You're kidding yourself if you think you're useless.
GID00071489	You're with the NCR, right?
GID00071490	Advance the Ranger Station quest.
GID00071491	Do Nothing.
GID00071492	Actually, I'm still not sure.
GID00071493	Why are there Fire Ants still down in the Metro tunnels?
GID00071494	PC asks how many souvenirs needed
GID00071495	PC hands over one or more souvenirs
GID00071496	What about this rocket souvenir? The stuff inside glows.
GID00071497	What about these rocket souvenirs? The stuff inside glows.
GID00071498	What about this rocket souvenir? The stuff inside glows.
GID00071499	What about these rocket souvenirs? The stuff inside glows.
GID00071500	What about these rocket souvenirs? The stuff inside glows.
GID00071501	I'd like to buy all of your remaining rocket souvenirs.
GID00071502	What's been going on in town lately?
GID00071503	We haven't met yet.
GID00071504	Sorry, I didn't mean what I said. This seems like a nice town.
GID00071505	Where can I get some supplies?
GID00071506	What is there of interest around here?
GID00071507	What is this place?
GID00071510	PC says he understands role of Chris H
GID00071511	Wow! You really pulled the wool over his eyes!
GID00071512	PC confirms Chris H will be left behind
GID00071513	PC attempts JasonBrightSpeechCheck
GID00071514	What's too bad?
GID00071515	I'd like to enter the prison.
GID00071516	I love using the computers and talking to my father's patients in the clinic.
GID00071517	Well, I shoot my BB Gun any chance I get. I can fix that thing blindfolded, too.
GID00071518	Look. I like blowing stuff up. I just love that... "kaboom"! Ya know?
GID00071519	Mr. B, if I told you what my "interests" are, you'd have me locked up.
GID00071520	I have a copy of the Emancipation Proclamation to sell.
GID00071521	Are you interested in buying the Gettysburg Address?
GID00071522	That price is an insult. You'll have to do better than that.
GID00071523	You can do better than that. This is the Gettysburg Address we're talking about.
GID00071524	I'm not really sure it's safe to carry those things around.
GID00071525	Is there radioactive material in your rocket souvenirs? It would explain the glow and the illnesses.
GID00071526	Is there radioactive material in your rocket souvenirs?
GID00071531	Heard anything interesting?
GID00071533	PC declines to help
GID00071534	Sorry. Not interested.
GID00071535	Like I said, not interested.
GID00071536	PC agrees to help
GID00071537	I've already killed your "demons."
GID00071538	I'll take care of the "demons" for you.
GID00071539	PC asks about additional obstacles
GID00071540	Have you considered surrendering?
GID00071541	I'd like to buy a dinosaur souvenir.
GID00071542	I'd like to buy one of those souvenir rockets.
GID00071543	Used to be?
GID00071544	Tell me more about the dinosaur souvenirs.
GID00071545	Who's No-bark?
GID00071546	Tell me about the rocket factory.
GID00071547	Tell me about the rocket souvenirs.
GID00071548	Tell me more about the souvenir rockets.
GID00071549	What do you sell here?
GID00071550	Heard anything else useful?
GID00071555	Come on. Let me in already!
GID00071560	Arkansas.
GID00071561	Susan Lancaster.
GID00071562	Red.
GID00071563	Flak.
GID00071564	The Overseer's bullshit makes my head spin. Can't you do it for me?
GID00071566	What's this mutually beneficial offer you mentioned?
GID00071567	Yeah, I'm not going to pay you that much.
GID00071568	I'd like to know more about the slave collar.
GID00071569	How does the collar work?
GID00071570	How do I get it on a slave?
GID00071571	Who can I put it on?
GID00071572	Let's talk about something else.
GID00071573	I'm not going to do your dirty work.
GID00071574	How's the Mesmetron work?
GID00071575	What happens if I run out of energy cells for it?
GID00071576	Where did you find it?
GID00071577	That's enough about the Mesmetron for now.
GID00071578	All right. It's time for me to go.
GID00071579	Enough about these guys.
GID00071580	If you want me to retrieve the Declaration, all you have to do is ask.
GID00071581	You must be Button Gwinnett, second signer of the Declaration!
GID00071582	Enough of this. Command protocol delta-seven-six. Reset.
GID00071583	What are your command options?
GID00071584	Issue shutdown command alpha-seven-three. Initiate.
GID00071585	Resume previous programming state. Command alpha-nine-nine.
GID00071586	Resume your original functions. Command alpha-six-eight. Initiate.
GID00071588	I'm looking for some ink. I was told it might be here in the library.
GID00071589	Nice job. I had no idea you were so good at shooting people.
GID00071590	Nice. This will come in handy if I run into any of your father's goons.
GID00071591	No, you keep it. You may need it more than I do.
GID00071597	I have the Declaration of Independence.
GID00071613	I tried to rescue your friends but there were... complications.
GID00071614	I'm not going to do it. You'll need to find another hero.
GID00071615	So, how are you getting along now that you've left Grayditch behind?
GID00071616	So, what are you going to do now about your experiments?
GID00071617	Hey, Doc. Will this Fire Ant Nectar do you any good?
GID00071642	Well, it's still a crapshack.
GID00071643	What are you doing in a place like this?
GID00071644	Sorry. I meant no offense.
GID00071645	PC suggests sabotage
GID00071646	PC offers sugar bombs
GID00071647	Here you go.
GID00071648	PC tells Chris he will be left behind
GID00071649	After they're gone, you can have a good life in Novac.
GID00071650	The guards are gone. You're free to leave.
GID00071651	PC asks how to help with rockets
GID00071652	I have the nuclear material you need.
GID00071658	I need you to repair my stuff.
GID00071659	What do you have for sale?
GID00071660	Here. Take back the money. I don't want to take medicine away from the town.
GID00071662	I'll think about it, but I can't rescue your friends now.
GID00071663	How did you end up here?
GID00071664	So what's with all the Super Mutants?
GID00071667	Can you repair my things?
GID00071669	I need repairs.
GID00071670	I'm here to see Roy Phillips.
GID00071671	I've met them. Roy Phillips and those other Ghouls don't seem all that bad.
GID00071672	I'll come back later then.
GID00071673	I'm here to see Tenpenny. But if you weren't so incompetent, you'd know that.
GID00071674	Do you know when I can see Mister Tenpenny?
GID00071676	You're secure in these tunnels. Why try to get into Tenpenny, anyway?
GID00071677	PC says Bright told him to speak to Chris about rockets
GID00071678	PC asks Chris about his condition
GID00071679	PC says Chris has smooth skin, too
GID00071680	PC challenges Chris's ghoulness - merely bald
GID00071681	He needs to talk to someone from the outside, to get some perspective.
GID00071682	Can't we talk this out?
GID00071683	Well, what are you waiting for?
GID00071684	I'd like something to drink.
GID00071685	I have to go now.
GID00071686	Thanks, Amata. I'll only use it as a last resort, I promise.
GID00071687	Tell me a joke.
GID00071688	Right the first time, ugly. I've come to kill you.
GID00071689	I have to go.
GID00071690	Player says why he or she is here.
GID00071691	I came here on behalf of the ghouls upstairs.
GID00071692	I just wandered in here, okay? I don't want trouble.
GID00071693	I'll think about it.
GID00071694	Okay, looks like I'm going to have to kill you.
GID00071695	The Stealth Boys were sent here by mistake, then sent back.
GID00071696	And who are you, exactly?
GID00071697	Why did you all come here, in the middle of nowhere?
GID00071698	Player asks why Harland's room can't be searched.
GID00071699	Why can't you search the last room?
GID00071700	Tell me again why you can't search the room?
GID00071701	Player asks how to help.
GID00071702	Maybe I can help.
GID00071703	What do you want me to do?
GID00071704	DELETE THIS
GID00071705	Why can't you just send your men in to kill the ghoul?
GID00071706	Which is?
GID00071707	What makes you think there are Stealth Boys here?
GID00071708	Player agrees to find Stealth Boy stockpile.
GID00071709	Sorry, but I've got some bad news for you.
GID00071710	I'll find the StealthBoy stockpile for you if your kin will leave this place.
GID00071711	I can find the stockpile of Stealth Boys for you.
GID00071712	Well, good luck finding them. I'm headed elsewhere.
GID00071713	I think I've helped enough for one day. Bye.
GID00071714	Where will you go once you have them?
GID00071715	PC reports still no sugar bombs
GID00071716	Sorry, no signs of the stockpile of Stealth Boys yet.
GID00071717	No, I just wanted to come down here to kill you up close.
GID00071718	Harland sent me. The way is clear, so get going.
GID00071719	The mutants are dead. You're free.
GID00071720	Actually, I was just wandering around.
GID00071721	Not yet. I'm still working on it.
GID00071723	Sure, Jack. No problem at all. I saw nothing.
GID00071724	No, Jack. You have to die. You and your sick little town.
GID00071725	That's the way to be, together to the end.
GID00071726	Well, whatever works you you.
GID00071727	No, not really. Everyone does what they have to.
GID00071728	I think that you're a bunch of sick fucks and I'm getting out of here.
GID00071729	Yes. You're going to die for what you've done, Jack.
GID00071730	Nah. It's not presumptuous at all. You have to go.
GID00071731	Actually, I'll just leave you alone.
GID00071732	Jack says you have some pie for me?
GID00071734	I'd like to change my house's Theme.
GID00071735	I hear you're the person to see about buying stuff for my suite.
GID00071736	Can you tell me what the items do?
GID00071737	Tell me about your Themes.
GID00071738	I'd like to change my house's Theme.
GID00071739	Okay, let me take a look at your stuff.
GID00071740	Enough about the suite. Let's talk about something else.
GID00071741	Tell me about the My First Infirmary.
GID00071742	Tell me about the Jukebox.
GID00071743	Tell me about the My First Laboratory.
GID00071744	Tell me about the Nuka-Cola Machine.
GID00071745	Tell me about the Workbench.
GID00071746	Tell me about the Robotic Butler.
GID00071747	Let me ask you about another item.
GID00071748	That's enough about the items.
GID00071751	I may be willing to help, but I need straight answers about who "He" is.
GID00071753	I hear you're the person to see about buying stuff for my house.
GID00071754	Can you tell me what the items do?
GID00071755	Tell me about your Themes.
GID00071756	Okay, let me take a look at your stuff.
GID00071757	Enough about the house. Let's talk about something else.
GID00071758	Tell me about the My First Infirmary.
GID00071759	Tell me about the Jukebox.
GID00071760	Tell me about the My First Laboratory.
GID00071761	Tell me about the Nuka-Cola Machine.
GID00071762	Tell me about the Workbench.
GID00071763	Tell me about the Robotic Butler.
GID00071764	Let me ask you about another item.
GID00071765	That's enough about the items.
GID00071778	You didn't fool me. I just pretended not to know. <Lie.>
GID00071779	Great party, Amata! Thanks for doing this for me.
GID00071780	Is this it? Or hasn't the real party started yet?
GID00071781	I really have no idea...
GID00071782	Um... a date with Christine Kendall?
GID00071783	Just give me the present already!
GID00071784	Yeah, my Dad and Amata threw me a great party, didn't they?
GID00071785	Why are you talking to me like I'm five?
GID00071786	Yes. Can I have my present now?
GID00071787	Thank you. I will treasure it always. Is that all?
GID00071788	Um... thanks. I guess. Did you get me anything else?
GID00071789	A poem? You've got to be kidding me.
GID00071790	Of course she likes me. I'm a really charming guy.
GID00071791	She did a great job. But couldn't you have helped out a bit more?
GID00071792	It's really cool. Did you fix it up for me?
GID00071793	It's all right. Seems kind of old, though.
GID00071794	I hate it. How do I get it off?
GID00071795	Wally said my Pip-Boy was a piece of junk!
GID00071796	Thanks, Stanley.
GID00071797	Sure, whatever. Did you bring me anything for my birthday?
GID00071798	<Yawn> That's really really interesting.
GID00071800	Wait. First, let's talk about what you've been doing.
GID00071804	Who's there?
GID00071833	How much for a room?
GID00071837	No, thanks.
GID00071839	I'm sorry, Agatha. I couldn't find the violin in Vault 92. <Lie.>
GID00071840	Wait... they made you the doctor?
GID00071843	If only you had something to help keep me safe, my little honey bee...
GID00071865	It's none of your business.
GID00071867	I've had a change of heart, Agatha. Here's your violin.
GID00071868	I broke a promise to someone and I'd like to buy back the violin for 300 caps.
GID00071872	Ohh... I'm feeling kind of sick, Mister B. Guess I'll have to reschedule...
GID00071873	Come on. I don't really have to take this stupid test, do I?
GID00071874	Sure, I'm ready. I bet I'll ace it!
GID00071875	Cool. Let me see the results and I'll fill it out myself.
GID00071876	I think I'd rather just take the G.O.A.T. myself and take my chances.
GID00071877	Please describe your original function.
GID00071878	How do I get to the Arlington Library?
GID00071879	How did you end up in this place?
GID00071880	Is there anything else you can tell me about the Declaration?
GID00071881	Sydney and I have the Declaration of Independence.
GID00071882	I'd get you a damn moon rock if you pay well enough.
GID00071883	Let me ask you about something else.
GID00071884	I'm kind of thirsty. Still got that Nuka-Cola Quantum for sale?
GID00071885	That sounds mighty good in this heat. What is it?
GID00071886	If it's that rare, I bet it will cost an arm and a leg.
GID00071887	Nope, I'm really not interested.
GID00071888	Nuka-Cola Quantum, huh? That does sound good. How much?
GID00071889	I heard arguing. What's going on?
GID00071890	You guys lost?
GID00071893	I've got to go now.
GID00071894	Sure, kid. Here's to my number one fan.
GID00071895	Autographs aren't free. I charge 10 caps for my time. No exceptions.
GID00071896	How about I give you my super suit? Would that make your day, kid?
GID00071897	Sorry. Not today.
GID00071898	Sorry. Not today.
GID00071899	Remind me what this deal is, again.
GID00071900	Yeah, I'm here about the deal.
GID00071901	Body parts for money. I like that. Now pay me.
GID00071902	What do you do here?
GID00071903	Why do you want ears?
GID00071904	What do these people do?
GID00071905	Who are you anyway.
GID00071906	Here. Take all of them.
GID00071907	Actually, never mind. I'll hang on to them.
GID00071908	I don't care about your cause. I'm here for the money.
GID00071909	What are the Regulators all about?
GID00071910	I'm in.
GID00071911	I'm not one for causes. I just want to get paid.
GID00071913	What do you do?
GID00071914	What do you do with these fingers?
GID00071915	Is this all of the Regulators?
GID00071916	Here. Take all of them.
GID00071917	Actually, never mind. I'll hang on to them.
GID00071919	Why are you so goddamned mean?
GID00071920	What do you do around here?
GID00071921	Where do you come from?
GID00071927	Who are you?
GID00071930	I'm searching for records from the library.
GID00071932	I'm interested in the Vault Theme.
GID00071933	I'm interested in the Raider Theme.
GID00071934	I'm interested in the Wasteland Explorer Theme.
GID00071935	I'm interested in the Science Theme.
GID00071936	I'm interested in the Pre-War Theme.
GID00071937	Let me ask about something else.
GID00071938	Actually, let me pick another Theme.
GID00071939	Sounds good to me.
GID00071943	Um... no. <Lie.>
GID00071944	It's a great place to live. But dirty Ghouls like you can't live there.
GID00071945	I wouldn't suggest going there. They don't treat your kind very well.
GID00071946	You had no choice. You only did what you had to do.
GID00071947	Why's the power out?
GID00071948	What are you doing down here?
GID00071951	I need to turn the power back on. Where are the reactor controls?
GID00071952	Do you make a lot of your own stuff?
GID00071953	I'll be sure to put this gun to good use. Thanks.
GID00071954	What have you made?
GID00071955	Wow... your own stuff. That's... just stupid. Why take apart good guns?
GID00071957	You're right. My country deserves my unthinking and unquestioning support.
GID00071958	Are you kidding? It's the duty of a citizen to question his government.
GID00071959	Do you think people who fought a war with tyrants wanted unquestioning support?
GID00071960	Well, they did give us guns and say, "If we fuck up, feel free to take us out."
GID00071961	I really don't know. I skipped American government class back in the Vault.
GID00071962	I couldn't possibly care less about governments or presidents.
GID00071963	If you've never seen the Enclave, how can you know anything about them?
GID00071964	Who are the Enclave, anyway?
GID00071965	That's all I needed to hear.
GID00071966	Don't worry about that gun. Take one of mine.
GID00071967	Let's get out of here, I don't have all day.
GID00071968	I want to help.
GID00071969	Oh good, I was looking for some kindling.
GID00071970	What's missing is my ability to stay awake in this snoreatorium.
GID00071971	It has to be the Declaration of Independence.
GID00071972	What's your point?
GID00071973	Let me ask you something else.
GID00071974	Just who are you, exactly?
GID00071975	That's quite brave of you. To potentially sacrifice your life over a document.
GID00071976	You're not even human, you stupid bucket of bolts!
GID00071977	Is there some way we can make a compromise?
GID00071978	This is what's going to happen. You die, I get the Declaration. Understand?
GID00071979	Nope, sorry. I've got to have that Declaration at any cost.
GID00071980	You were right! I am a Redcoat Spy and the place is surrounded by my army!
GID00071981	Keep the Declaration safe... don't let anyone take it.
GID00071982	Do whatever you want... I'm out of here.
GID00071983	Blow yourself up.
GID00071984	Anything we can do to pull the wool over their eyes is a blow for freedom!
GID00071985	I've got it! We'll kill all of the English scholars!
GID00071986	This is getting ridiculous. Just give me the Declaration, now!
GID00071987	I am presenting it to our King in Great Britain.
GID00071988	Just give me the damn Declaration already!
GID00071989	You can do whatever you like.
GID00071990	You're a disgrace. I order your immediate dismissal from the Congress!
GID00071992	Let me think about this for a bit, and I'll get back to you.
GID00071993	Yeah... better than you, deadeye.
GID00071994	I'm not looking for anything. I'm just passing through.
GID00071995	I don't have time for this crap.
GID00071996	Hang on, there. You need to tell me who you are before I agree to anything!
GID00071997	Who's stupid enough to shell out a bunch of caps for a scrap of paper?
GID00071998	I have a few questions about the Declaration of Independence.
GID00071999	What's the history behind the document?
GID00072000	How did you get into the relic hunting business?
GID00072001	Well, I could use some firepower myself. What are you selling?
GID00072002	Hand over your merchandise if you don't want to die!
GID00072003	Interesting. Well, I'll see you around.
GID00072006	It's good to see you, Amata. I'm sorry I didn't trust you earlier.
GID00072007	I said I didn't need your help to escape. Turns out I was right.
GID00072008	Yes, I was going to. Still am, if you'll shut up and get out of my way.
GID00072009	I'm sorry, Amata. But I had no choice.
GID00072011	I enjoyed killing him. Now get out of my way.
GID00072012	You look a little lost. Do you need directions?
GID00072013	The Temple is in the Lincoln Memorial, near the Washington Monument.
GID00072014	It's far northwest of D.C. Real friendly people there. <Lie.>
GID00072015	Never mind. I've got to get going.
GID00072020	I'd really like to speak to Reilly and find out what happened to her.
GID00072049	I'm sorry, Amata, but I couldn't risk helping you. They would have killed me.
GID00072050	My only concern was getting this door open, and I did it.
GID00072051	Must not have been too bad. You're still alive, aren't you?
GID00072059	What can you tell me about Doctor Li?
GID00072060	Thanks, Officer Gomez. I always liked you.
GID00072061	And I'll pretend you don't work for a homicidal maniac.
GID00072062	As far as I'm concerned, you're a murderer just like the rest of them.
GID00072063	I'm not going to go out of my way to find these slaves for you.
GID00072068	There must be something I can do to stay.
GID00072069	What if I just make a donation to the Republic... and you let me stay?
GID00072070	You crazy, condescending asshole! No one exiles me!
GID00072071	A Hunting Rifle? Fine, I'll be back with one.
GID00072072	I'll be back with 250 caps.
GID00072073	I'm not giving you anything.
GID00072074	I couldn't have done it without your help.
GID00072075	When I say I'm going to do something.... I do it.
GID00072076	I didn't need your help. Go back to your crazy father.
GID00072081	You guys are pretty isolated. Where do you get your supplies?
GID00072082	So you pretty much get the leftovers?
GID00072083	So what would it take for you to get some decent supplies?
GID00072084	What do you need? Maybe I could bring you stuff to trade.
GID00072085	Sounds like a good deal to me, man.
GID00072086	What's in it for me?
GID00072087	Yeah, fuck that. I don't work for you.
GID00072088	Sounds pretty rough, but that's business for you.
GID00072089	Tough shit, man. Now shut up and sell me the stuff you already have.
GID00072090	Why not put a boot to their asses and take the good stuff?
GID00072091	What do you need? Maybe I could bring you stuff to trade.
GID00072092	Sounds pretty rough, but that's business for you.
GID00072093	Tough shit, man. Now shut up and sell me the stuff you already have.
GID00072094	They keep the good stuff? No wonder your selection sucks.
GID00072095	Tough break, man. But let's talk about something else.
GID00072097	Actually, never mind.
GID00072098	So? What's the count?
GID00072099	Come on, I haven't got all day.
GID00072104	I'm here to do research on the city's history.
GID00072105	Look, this kid's just like you. On his own, no parents... Give him a chance!
GID00072106	Look, this kid needs to be with people his own age. Give him a chance.
GID00072107	All right. How many caps is it going to take to change your mind?
GID00072108	Forget it.
GID00072109	For God's sake... Stop acting like an asshole and let the kid in!
GID00072110	I'm just glad you're safe.
GID00072111	Yep, it was all me.
GID00072112	How exactly can I destroy the mutagen?
GID00072113	Any idea where I can look for someone to take care of you?
GID00072114	Tell me, too! Then I won't be scared either.
GID00072131	I ought to kill you for treating people like this. In fact, I think I will.
GID00072137	Sorry. I've got other things on my mind right now.
GID00072144	I'm not a kid! I'm ten years old!
GID00072145	Can it, Jonas. Where's my surprise present already?
GID00072146	Oh... But Dad told me it was okay to come down here.
GID00072147	Thanks a lot, Jonas. This is really cool.
GID00072148	Couldn't you get me a real gun? A BB Gun is kind of lame.
GID00072149	I guess so. I'm just not that into shooting things.
GID00072172	I killed a bunch of crazy Ghouls in the Metro tunnels...
GID00072174	Who's in charge here?
GID00072175	I think I can handle that.
GID00072176	Yeah... not really interested.
GID00072177	I have data to sell you.
GID00072178	You knew my father?
GID00072179	I loved him so much. I'll never forget him.
GID00072180	By all means, ask.
GID00072181	I don't suppose I could stop you.
GID00072182	Why does it matter how a man dies? Death is death.
GID00072183	He died as he lived. A selfish asshole.
GID00072184	What about the Enclave?
GID00072185	I would be honored, Star Paladin Cross.
GID00072186	Perhaps later.
GID00072187	Do you know about the Enclave?
GID00072195	What was that? You hurt me! You're the worst medical robot ever!
GID00072196	I had some questions for you, Sawbones.
GID00072197	Run a level two diagnostic on the medical subsystems.
GID00072198	Close neural pathway 0x63A82 and reroute remaining functions.
GID00072199	What is that pathway responsible for?
GID00072200	Say, could I reprogram you to kill people?
GID00072201	Wait... what? That was pretty articulate for a robot.
GID00072202	Define "unusual."
GID00072203	Why would you want to harm humans?
GID00072204	If you can't harm humans, how were you able to hurt me?
GID00072205	Does the Brotherhood know that you're intelligent?
GID00072206	What do you want me to do?
GID00072207	Well, that must suck. I'll leave you to that.
GID00072208	What did we ever do to you?
GID00072209	Well, that's great. I don't care.
GID00072210	Hmm. Interesting. Forget it.
GID00072211	Cancel. Return to main menu.
GID00072212	Ouch! That hurt! What the hell?
GID00072220	Bad news. Slavers are in control of the Memorial.
GID00072221	Let me go, or I swear to God, I'll rip your fucking throat out!
GID00072222	Why are you so interested in Lincoln artifacts?
GID00072223	I delivered that letter to your brother Ian.
GID00072241	Can someone in the Citadel train me to wear Power Armor?
GID00072243	Ants exhibit class system behavior, so I'll try and kill the Queen fast.
GID00072244	Hey, I know it's scary to be alone. Just hang in there!
GID00072245	Does the museum accept donations?
GID00072246	I happen to have some souvenirs from Dave's past for sale.
GID00072247	Well, everything here looks like a piece of junk.
GID00072248	Nevermind. Just thought I'd ask.
GID00072249	This guy Dave has his own museum?
GID00072250	Can we skip the story and get to a solution?
GID00072251	Slow down, professor... Once more in English, okay?
GID00072252	I've got news for you, brainiac. It ain't working.
GID00072253	I'm shocked you didn't attempt this in a controlled environment first.
GID00072254	Ha! You call yourself a scientist? That's rich.
GID00072255	What do you know about Bryan Wilks?
GID00072256	So, what will you do now, Doctor?
GID00072257	About your experiments...
GID00072258	What's the goal of your experiments?
GID00072259	What's gone wrong with the mutagen?
GID00072260	Something isn't right. You shouldn't have gotten results like these so quickly.
GID00072262	Yes, it would be dangerous letting the Wasteland know where Oasis is located.
GID00072263	I don't see that it matters much. Oasis is off the beaten path as it is.
GID00072264	Stop being so selfish! You people should share this place with everyone!
GID00072276	What do you know about Zimmer?
GID00072280	You know anything about an android looking for surgery? 100 caps if you do.
GID00072281	You know anything about the physiology of biological robotica from the North?
GID00072282	Tell me what you know about an android, and I'll give you 100 caps.
GID00072283	I find android physiology fascinating, don't you? Do you know much about it?
GID00072284	I'm sorry you don't get along with Dr. Li. But we were discussing the android.
GID00072285	What's she got to do with this? Show me this "proof" about the android.
GID00072286	Yeah, she's a bitch... Can we talk about the android now?
GID00072287	I give you 100 caps. You tell me about the Commonwealth android. Deal?
GID00072288	I want to know about the android. Start talking, or start bleeding.
GID00072289	I'll give you 100 caps for what you've got on this android.
GID00072290	I'm losing my patience! Tell me about the android with the face job!
GID00072291	Here's a 100 cap "donation." Now, where's that escaped android?
GID00072292	Tell me where this android disappeared to, or I'll make you disappear. Got it?
GID00072293	Here's 100 caps for the Railroad. Do you have any news on the android?
GID00072294	I'm worried about the android. Have you head anything recently?
GID00072295	Here's 100 caps for the Railroad. Now tell me about the android.
GID00072296	I'm trying to locate the android. I'm worried about him. What do you know?
GID00072297	Here's a 100 cap donation to the Railroad. Now where's the android.
GID00072298	It's important I find that android. I believe he's in great danger.
GID00072299	You heard the story about an android? Here's 100 caps for your trouble.
GID00072300	What do you know about the android from up north?
GID00072302	Got any info on an android mind wipe? Here's a 100 cap "research fee."
GID00072303	You know how they rewrote engrams in a cluster of Android memory subroutines?
GID00072304	I'll give you 100 caps if you know who did the mind wipe on that android.
GID00072305	Do you know anything about the AI swap on that Commonwealth android?
GID00072307	Maybe you'd accept this 100 caps as "insurance" of my good behavior?
GID00072308	Ah come on. Let me in. Pretty please, with sugar on top?
GID00072310	You won't be getting a bribe from me.
GID00072311	Let me in asshole!
GID00072312	Relax. It's just a warning, not a threat. I'm not going to kill you.
GID00072313	Anything you want to say before you meet your maker?
GID00072314	I don't have to kill you. If you were to give me a handful of caps...
GID00072316	Let me ask you something else.
GID00072317	I don't know... you look like a tasty snack for a monster.
GID00072320	Where did Doctor Lesko stay?
GID00072321	Do you have any idea what Doctor Lesko was doing in Grayditch?
GID00072322	Did Doctor Lesko have any weird stuff in his place?
GID00072323	Where's your house?
GID00072324	What happened to those Super Mutants?
GID00072326	That's all I need to know.
GID00072327	Dave has two wives?
GID00072328	Where did all these wives come from?
GID00072329	Dave's got the right idea. Sign me up!
GID00072330	Having two wives sounds like trouble.
GID00072331	You're all freaks.
GID00072332	I've heard enough.
GID00072333	What are you doing way out here by yourself?
GID00072344	This poster is worth more than that.
GID00072345	For Lincoln's own hat? Come on. You can do better than that.
GID00072346	Not enough. Make me a better offer.
GID00072347	You'll have to do better than that.
GID00072348	In your dreams. It's worth twice that.
GID00072349	That price is an insult. You can do better.
GID00072350	You're kidding, right? It's worth twice that.
GID00072351	No way. I need a lot more than that.
GID00072352	Help costs caps.
GID00072353	Nothing. Sorry, my mistake.
GID00072354	Pack your shit. We're getting out of this insane asylum!
GID00072355	Maybe I can help you.
GID00072356	Then stay. I think you belong here with the Family.
GID00072357	Yeah, something's wrong. You're all a bunch of murderers.
GID00072358	Read this letter, Ian. Lucy wrote it. I bet it will change your mind.
GID00072361	Why did you... do what you did to your own parents?
GID00072362	How did Vance know you were one of them?
GID00072363	How did you end up leaving Arefu?
GID00072364	Huh? What are you talking about? Evan King sent me.
GID00072365	Sure, yeah. I have your fall catalog.
GID00072366	Never mind.
GID00072367	Evan King sent me. Can I come in?
GID00072368	I'm from the Family! Let me in!
GID00072369	Sorry, my mistake.
GID00072370	Your wife let me in... something about a catalog?
GID00072371	Dave is corrupt! The Republic needs a new champion of freedom!
GID00072372	Don't worry. I'm just here to play Republic with you.
GID00072373	You could lead the Republic into a new era! The Democracy of Rosie!
GID00072374	Forget it, Dave. I'm not giving you any secrets.
GID00072375	I come from the Land of the Mirelurks! They demand you surrender the Republic!
GID00072376	My nation is a helpless, unarmed village to the north. We beg your assistance.
GID00072377	My former nation was a Vault. The only secrets were kept by the Overseer.
GID00072380	What is it that you do here, Gallows?
GID00072381	Is there anyway I could help you?
GID00072382	So, do I get to know, or do I have to guess?
GID00072383	What do you need me to do?
GID00072384	What's in it for me?
GID00072385	Is that your job? Why do you need me to do it?
GID00072386	Yeah, no thanks.
GID00072387	You talk too much. Cut the chatter and get to the point, would you?
GID00072388	Yeah... on second thought, never mind.
GID00072389	Well. Sounds very exciting. I'll let you get back to that.
GID00072393	The bomb in town just blew up! You're lucky to be alive!
GID00072394	I have no idea. I wasn't even here. <Lie.>
GID00072395	I blew up your town. Maybe you shouldn't have built it around a bomb.
GID00072396	How odd. It appears that the burst of radiation has turned you into a Ghoul.
GID00072404	Moira? Is that you? You don't look so good.
GID00072405	You're going to let a bunch of Slavers scare you? Attack them!
GID00072406	I've done what I can. We should attack now.
GID00072407	Looks to me like you're getting ready for war. What are you really doing here?
GID00072408	The Slavers are too tough. You haven't got a chance.
GID00072409	I don't hunt runaway slaves.
GID00072410	I want something to drink, kill and steal. Not necessarily in that order.
GID00072411	Not for that price. I want more.
GID00072434	What do you know about Tenpenny?
GID00072439	Where are the other Tenpenny Tower residents?
GID00072440	What happened to Mister Tenpenny?
GID00072441	You've got yourself a deal. Here's your 200 caps.
GID00072442	Never mind.
GID00072443	I need to buy some more ammo for the Mesmetron.
GID00072444	Mr. President, what's so special about this key?
GID00072445	What's the key for?
GID00072446	Hey, anything for some extra caps.
GID00072455	Where can I find the traders?
GID00072456	Where do the caravans set up?
GID00072457	Can I get some directions around town?
GID00072458	That's all I need to know.
GID00072459	Where can I get some food?
GID00072462	So they killed Jonas, and I'm next, is that it?
GID00072471	Your robot's working fine, now.
GID00072472	I had to disable that robot. It was going to explode. <Lie.>
GID00072473	Your robot made this satisfying grinding noise when I ripped out its innards.
GID00072474	Amazing, this place seems so abundant with animal life.
GID00072475	I can't explain it, but I can feel this place just teeming with life.
GID00072476	The way you're saying "Him," I could swear you're referring to a god...
GID00072477	Trust is a two-way street. I don't feel safe with all this mysterious talk.
GID00072478	Tree Father Birch said you may have a gift for me?
GID00072480	What will you do now?
GID00072481	What do you see in my future?
GID00072493	That's a complicated job. I'm going to need some money.
GID00072494	Sounds like a deal.
GID00072495	Forget it. I'm not interested.
GID00072497	Why don't you just kill them and take all their stuff? Everyone else does.
GID00072498	I'm an escaped slave. I was told you help runaways like me. <Lie.>
GID00072499	What's the story with Hannibal?
GID00072500	If I had known this before, I wouldn't have come in. Let me go!
GID00072501	I want to know what you're hiding in there. Now open the damn door.
GID00072502	Wouldn't a beacon just attract the Slavers?
GID00072503	So, you used to be a slave?
GID00072504	That's a really stupid idea.
GID00072505	What do you do here?
GID00072506	Something wrong with your robot?
GID00072507	I'm just looking for some supplies.
GID00072508	I guess that robot doesn't like your house. I agree: the architecture sucks.
GID00072509	I could try to fix that robot for you.
GID00072510	What will you give me if I fix it?
GID00072511	Hmm... A robot complaining about you forever. I like it that way.
GID00072512	I'm not interested in fixing things right now.
GID00072546	What can you tell me about Canterbury Commons?
GID00072574	Whoa, calm down. I was just exploring this area.
GID00072575	I use what I can find, the same as anyone.
GID00072576	Does it involve money? I really like money. Like, a lot.
GID00072577	As long as there's money involved, I'm in. Mmmm.... money.
GID00072578	Money and the promise of mysterious compensation? I'm in.
GID00072579	I'm interested in this. Tell me more.
GID00072580	And you want me to help you gather books, right?
GID00072581	The mighty Brotherhood is gathering books? Seriously?
GID00072582	Sorry, I'm too busy right now.
GID00072583	Why should I tell you anything, lady?
GID00072584	I can't go anywhere without bumping into you assholes.
GID00072585	I guess I'll be going, then.
GID00072586	What do you do in this library?
GID00072587	Why are you collecting books?
GID00072588	Wait... Is there a problem with your Elder?
GID00072589	I see. Thanks.
GID00072590	What's happening here?
GID00072591	What are you doing way out here?
GID00072592	Is there anything going on here?
GID00072593	Back off or I'll make you regret threatening me.
GID00072594	How about I give you 5 caps and you leave me alone?
GID00072595	Bullshit. A mugger in the Wasteland? A real Raider would've shot me already.
GID00072596	That gun doesn't look loaded.
GID00072597	All right. I haven't killed anyone all day. Let's go.
GID00072598	I can't give you all my stuff, sorry.
GID00072599	I have two books.
GID00072600	I'll trade one.
GID00072601	I'll trade two.
GID00072602	I'll trade three.
GID00072603	I'll trade four.
GID00072604	I'll trade five.
GID00072605	Take all the books I have.
GID00072606	Actually, never mind.
GID00072607	Actually, I don't have any books to trade.
GID00072608	What were you doing up here?
GID00072609	I have one Holotag for you.
GID00072610	I have two Holotags for you.
GID00072611	I have three Holotags for you.
GID00072612	I have four Holotags for you.
GID00072613	I have five Holotags for you.
GID00072614	Take all the Holotags I have.
GID00072615	Never mind.
GID00072616	You play live on the radio all the time? That must be exhausting!
GID00072624	I can't give you all my stuff, sorry.
GID00072642	I'm wondering what I could do with all these spare caps I have...
GID00072643	That's very helpful. Here you go.
GID00072644	I don't have that many caps.
GID00072645	On second thought, maybe I'll hang onto them.
GID00072647	Let's discuss something else.
GID00072648	Have you had run-ins with them?
GID00072649	Well, wouldn't you kill if that was part of your contract?
GID00072650	Sounds like my kind of people.
GID00072651	What's the deal with Talon Company?
GID00072677	I have to say I'm surprised you aren't angrier with me.
GID00072678	And here I thought you'd be ready to kill me.
GID00072679	Welcome back to the Wasteland, asshole.
GID00072680	What will become of Oasis?
GID00072681	You'll make due.
GID00072682	I could care less about your problems. I'm out of here.
GID00072683	How is it you're causing all of these things to grow around you?
GID00072700	Slow down. Where is everyone?
GID00072716	Yes, take this Stradivarius Violin I found in Vault 92.
GID00072717	Maybe. You gonna give me something for it?
GID00072718	Oh, you said violin? I thought you needed something else. Never mind.
GID00072719	Are you taking Jet over here?
GID00072720	About what? My hair?
GID00072721	You stay away from my hair.
GID00072722	How does a Ghoul end up as a barber?
GID00072723	I was glad to do it. Oasis needs to be protected.
GID00072724	Sure, I guess.
GID00072725	I could have used a pile of caps instead, but whatever.
GID00072726	You've become an important part of their life. Without you, they're lost.
GID00072727	I'm not the killing type.
GID00072728	You're obviously crazier than they are. Why would I listen to you?
GID00072729	I was glad to do it. Oasis needs to be shared with the world.
GID00072730	Sure, I guess.
GID00072731	I could have used a pile of caps instead, but whatever.
GID00072734	So... What exactly is this place?
GID00072736	Damn! I wish I had a setup like this.
GID00072737	Admit it. You're just a whore.
GID00072738	I guess you'll just have to live with your choice.
GID00072745	Why don't you just go over and see what he's yelling about?
GID00072746	Oh, come on. He'll listen to reason. Go talk to him.
GID00072747	Hmm. Good point. Best to leave him alone.
GID00072748	What's that guy's problem?
GID00072749	I'm interested in trading.
GID00072759	Sounds like you've been having some bad luck.
GID00072760	Lucky for you that you got away, huh?
GID00072761	Maybe? What do you mean?
GID00072762	You think being attacked by Raiders is good luck?
GID00072763	You'd rather those Raiders caught you? Maybe you are crazy.
GID00072764	That sounds bad.
GID00072765	Obviously you got out somehow.
GID00072766	Tell your crazy stories to somehow who cares.
GID00072767	That was a stroke of good luck.
GID00072768	Do you still have any? I could use some water.
GID00072769	I've had enough of this pointless story. Shut up already.
GID00072770	Like I said, bad luck for you.
GID00072771	Like I said, you were lucky to get away.
GID00072772	So that's your story? I can't believe I stood here and listened to it.
GID00072773	You said "before I became this." What did you mean?
GID00072785	A frail old lady like yourself should be careful out here all alone.
GID00072786	Trade? This place is empty. What, are you a prostitute or something?
GID00072787	I guess a homemade violin is never quite in tune...
GID00072788	You have records from back then?
GID00072789	2077? I can't even imagine that long ago.
GID00072790	This already sounds kind of like a wild goose chase.
GID00072791	Musical talent? Why would they care about that?
GID00072792	This violin she owned, was it valuable?
GID00072793	Actually, forget the stories... let's get to the point.
GID00072794	After 200 years, how can you be certain the violin is in decent shape?
GID00072795	So you want me to risk my ass for a violin that's probably rotted away by now?
GID00072796	Look, granny... Talk is cheap, but getting stuff isn't.
GID00072797	I want to help you, but that type of search could cost me greatly.
GID00072798	I have a very unique item for sale, a genuine Stradivarius violin.
GID00072799	Sure, that sounds fair.
GID00072800	Let me consider your offer.
GID00072801	How about we make it 300 caps?
GID00072802	A medic, huh? Can you patch me up?
GID00072803	Well, looks like you got yourselves into a mess. Nice work.
GID00072804	The shit's about to hit the fan up here, and you're asking questions?
GID00072805	Look, let's get out of here and I promise I'll take you to her.
GID00072806	Here's some ammo for you.
GID00072807	I'll call the shots from here.
GID00072808	Maybe I can fix the elevator.
GID00072809	I don't think you're in any condition to be up and about.
GID00072810	I've heard of you guys. You pack some serious firepower.
GID00072811	Oh, not the mighty Reilly's Rangers! Oooh, scary...
GID00072812	Wow, Reilly. You look like shit.
GID00072813	Did you set any kinds of traps or mines?
GID00072814	Forget it. I may as well shoot myself in the head and save the trouble.
GID00072815	There's something about this you're not telling me, isn't there?
GID00072816	Let's skip all the story and get to the point. What do you need?
GID00072817	Who are you? I've never met a friendly Super Mutant before.
GID00072818	A talking Super Mutant? What next, a dog on a bicycle?
GID00072819	I just wanted to get a good look at your ugly mug before I blew it away.
GID00072820	Give me everything you've got and I might let you live.
GID00072821	Um. Thanks.
GID00072822	You don't seem to understand. I'm robbing you.
GID00072823	I don't need some old clothes you found. Time to die, freak.
GID00072824	How'd you get the name Uncle Leo?
GID00072827	I think it would be good for the Republic, Mister President.
GID00072828	You've got your drink. Now I want to know all about this place.
GID00072829	I don't need to stay here and listen to your lame insults.
GID00072830	You want to kill humans? I thought it would just be Ghouls. No way.
GID00072831	Maybe. I don't know if I trust you.
GID00072832	Just give me the key. Don't ask why.
GID00072840	I don't have that information.
GID00072841	My posting title is Ass Kicker and my number is 5.56 mm!
GID00072842	My posting is Nuka-Cola R&D and my number is 987065. <Lie.>
GID00072843	My posting is Shipping Clerk and my number is NCSD-701G.
GID00072844	I'm John-Caleb Bradberton. I don't need an ID number. I own this place!
GID00072845	Forget it. I'm in the wrong place.
GID00072846	I'm looking for the factory's shipping manifests.
GID00072847	Any information you could give me on the caves below Oasis would be helpful.
GID00072848	How do I get into the caves?
GID00072849	Is there anything down there to look out for?
GID00072850	You don't actually seem that sad. Why do you want to die?
GID00072851	Hey, life is a gift. Even if it lasts a long time, be glad you have it!
GID00072852	I understand what you mean.
GID00072853	If people thought I was a god, I'd exploit it for all it's worth!
GID00072854	Seeing me approach Oasis is quite a feat for a living tree.
GID00072855	See me coming? That's not possible.
GID00072856	You say you saw me coming to Oasis. And you call the Treeminders crazy...
GID00072857	Your names are quite strange. What do they mean?
GID00072859	No, I haven't. Say, does that hurt?
GID00072860	Your "Republic" is a joke, and your presidency is a farce. You need to die.
GID00072861	What do you have in mind?
GID00072863	How did all of you meet?
GID00072864	So it was just you and Mister Crowley?
GID00072869	Oh boo hoo. People die all the time.
GID00072870	She your new toy, zombie?
GID00072871	Okay, thanks. Got to go.
GID00072872	Not long, fortunately.
GID00072873	What difference does it make?
GID00072874	Oh, it's been centuries. The planet is a lush, green paradise once again.
GID00072875	How did this all happen, Reilly?
GID00072894	If you don't mind me saying, you look different from everyone else.
GID00072895	I like your makeup. The pale-white really reflects the lighting.
GID00072896	I like corpses. Especially if they're full of holes... that I put in them.
GID00072897	You need to set yourself apart from the mold. Then people will respect you.
GID00072898	That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Survival goes before style.
GID00072899	I'm a night person myself. The darkness conceals my... activities.
GID00072900	Moons are nice. The calm nights of the Wastes are a great time to relax.
GID00072901	I was being sarcastic. That white makeup is like painting a target on your head.
GID00072902	Actually, never mind. There's something else I need to know.
GID00072910	I have something to say to you, Bittercup.
GID00072911	Why don't you seem to care about what's going on around here?
GID00072912	Wait, what? Did you just hit on me?
GID00072913	I'm not even going to tell you what's wrong with that question...
GID00072914	Why, no. I'm not in any sort of relationship. Are you?
GID00072926	Is there anything else interesting to see near Girdershade?
GID00072927	What can you tell me about Nuka-Cola Cocktails?
GID00072928	Sierra is dead.
GID00072929	Sorry, I don't know. (Lie)
GID00072930	I killed her. Got a problem with that, tough guy?
GID00072931	You sound like you were in love with her.
GID00072937	I agree completely!
GID00072938	What if there are other that don't share your opinion?
GID00072939	You speak heresy! Tree Father Birch should hear about this!
GID00072940	Tell me about your "god."
GID00072941	Did you know your god wants to die?
GID00072942	Hey, maybe if you tell me what Harold is scared of I won't be scared either.
GID00072943	What's Harold scared of?
GID00072944	I can't believe a tree would be scared of anything.
GID00072945	Yeah, well guess what? He's really a monster!
GID00072946	Why didn't Birch or Laurel call on you to do what I'm doing?
GID00072949	What did you have to do to become a Treeminder?
GID00072950	How did the Treeminders begin?
GID00072951	How do the Treeminders normally handle other Outsiders?
GID00072952	Could I become a Treeminder?
GID00072953	I think you're right. Who knows what would happen to this place?
GID00072954	What if all the Treeminders don't agree with you?
GID00072955	I don't think Leaf Mother Laurel is going to like hearing you say that!
GID00072957	What exactly does a bottle of Quantum look like?
GID00072958	What happens when you drink a Nuka-Cola Quantum?
GID00072959	Drinking that stuff can't be good for you if it contains radiation.
GID00072960	Can I see what you have for sale?
GID00072963	Sounds like a deal. Good to see you on the outside, Butch!
GID00072964	How did you get all the way down here?
GID00072965	Oh great. I thought I was rid of you.
GID00072970	Can't you see, Sierra? He just wants to sleep with you.
GID00072971	You bitch! That was supposed to be for me!
GID00072972	Whatever.
GID00072973	What happened to our deal, Sierra?
GID00072974	Sounds revolting. Who would eat that?
GID00072976	So, you're under constant threat?
GID00072977	Where do the Super Mutants come from?
GID00072978	Paradise Falls? Where's that?
GID00072979	I want a new opening speech. One that acknowledges me as King.
GID00072980	You've accepted death? Killing all of you should be easy, then.
GID00072981	Aw, that's no fun. I prefer my victims energetic and in agony.
GID00072982	I just need somewhere to trade my salvage.
GID00072984	Who lives here?
GID00072987	What will you give me for this toy of Lincoln?
GID00072988	How much for this war poster?
GID00072989	Are you interested in Lincoln's hat?
GID00072990	I found Lincoln's diary.
GID00072991	I have a collection of pennies with Lincoln's face on them.
GID00072992	I've got a wanted poster for Lincoln's assassin.
GID00072997	Tell you what, handsome. Find me some Quantum and we'll make it a threesome.
GID00072998	How about you pay me double for each Quantum bottle.
GID00072999	Yoo-hoo! Anyone home?
GID00073000	Shut up already...
GID00073001	Okay, enough with the addict routine. Tell me what you want already!
GID00073002	Come on, Sierra. No secrets between friends!
GID00073010	What's the latest gossip?
GID00073061	I don't know... For some reason, I feel like I belong here.
GID00073090	It's done, Evan. The Family will never bother Arefu again.
GID00073091	Yeah, I took care of your problem.
GID00073092	The Family's been dealt with and you owe me big.
GID00073093	Well, I have this letter for the West Family.
GID00073094	Any help you can provide would be appreciated.
GID00073095	Look, I'm not here to hurt anyone, I swear.
GID00073097	I have a message for the West family from their daughter.
GID00073119	Where can I find Ted Strayer?
GID00073122	Dukov has a key I need. Steal it for me.
GID00073123	Hey, can I have some of that hooch?
GID00073124	What's the story with that Ghoul?
GID00073125	Where did he come from?
GID00073126	Do you ever... you know... work with him?
GID00073127	Why is Moriarty so hard on him?
GID00073128	Let's talk about something else.
GID00073129	So, what's it take to hire you?
GID00073130	What were you saying about radio stations?
GID00073177	What kind of meat is that you're selling, anyway?
GID00073191	Finding a crew might be tough. Good luck, though.
GID00073192	I've brought some bloodpacks to contribute.
GID00073193	How are things going now?
GID00073194	I need something to help me concentrate...
GID00073195	So you've got someone in town with a drug habit?
GID00073196	A place like this is probably crawling with junkies, huh?
GID00073197	Ha! Figures a shithole like this would have a local Chem head.
GID00073198	What are you looking at?
GID00073199	Are you okay? You seem a little out of it.
GID00073200	I said: Are you all right?
GID00073201	Never mind, you crazy old bastard.
GID00073241	I'm afraid Harold isn't a god. He's just a human that had some bad luck.
GID00073242	He's not a god, Birch. His name's Harold.
GID00073243	Can we just dispense with all of the religious crap? His name's Harold!
GID00073244	Did you know your god wants me to kill him?
GID00073245	Are you aware that Harold wants to die?
GID00073246	Did you know that crazy tree thing wants me to kill it?
GID00073247	So what can I do to help?
GID00073248	Killing him should stop his influence from spreading.
GID00073249	Good! Free firewood for all!
GID00073250	Doesn't anybody care what your god thinks?
GID00073251	Why don't any of you listen to Harold?
GID00073252	This is a waste of my time.
GID00073253	How can I possibly help?
GID00073254	Uh oh... I see where this is going...
GID00073255	I give up. Just let me know what you want now.
GID00073256	What's your opinion of Tree Father Birch and Leaf Mother Laurel?
GID00073257	So, how did you end up here?
GID00073258	Dying? How awful! What happened to you?
GID00073259	Why'd you stay here after you recovered?
GID00073260	I'm not sure I could live with these loonies.
GID00073261	I have some questions about the task you gave me.
GID00073262	Why don't you just travel to Harold's heart on your own?
GID00073263	Were you aware that Laurel gave me this Liniment?
GID00073264	Where did the sap come from?
GID00073265	Where is the entrance to the caves?
GID00073266	I'd like to ask about something else.
GID00073268	What if he asks someone else to explode the bomb? You should do something.
GID00073269	He gave me this Fusion Pulse Charge to rig to the bomb. Here, take it.
GID00073270	Actually, I think he was just kidding.
GID00073271	I have a "proposition" of my own. Would you like to hear it, Mister Burke?
GID00073272	You see, I live here, lover. And surely you wouldn't want to hurt me...
GID00073273	Burke, you silly man. You'll pay me 500 extra caps... and like it.
GID00073274	All right. Say I decide to help you. What's in it for me?
GID00073275	Too many lives are at stake, Burke! I'm going to defuse that bomb.
GID00073277	Don't you think someone should disarm that thing?
GID00073278	Who would build a town around a bomb? That's crazy!
GID00073279	One day, that thing's going to go off. You're living on borrowed time.
GID00073280	I can see about disarming that bomb for you.
GID00073281	Whatever. I don't plan on sticking around very long, anyway.
GID00073282	If that bomb ever explodes, it would be doing the world a favor...
GID00073283	Burke gave me this Fusion Pulse Charge to rig to the bomb. You want it?
GID00073284	You call this trash heap a town? It's... pathetic.
GID00073285	Right. Message received.
GID00073286	You don't scare me.
GID00073287	<Say nothing.>
GID00073288	There's a new sheriff in town! It's time to die, asshole.
GID00073289	I want your hat. What do you think about that?
GID00073290	Ha! I'm just messing with you.
GID00073291	You're dead.
GID00073292	I'm just messing with you. Relax!
GID00073294	Let's talk about this house.
GID00073306	What are you shooting at out there?
GID00073307	I've been wondering... why blow up Megaton?
GID00073308	You've got to clear away the past to make room for the future.
GID00073309	You don't have a problem with killing all those people?
GID00073310	<Say nothing.>
GID00073311	I'm interested in the Vault Theme.
GID00073312	Yes, I'd like to buy it please.
GID00073313	I'm interested in the Raider Theme.
GID00073315	I'm interested in the Wasteland Explorer Theme.
GID00073317	I'm interested in the Science Theme.
GID00073319	I'm interested in the Pre-War Theme.
GID00073321	Let me ask about something else.
GID00073322	Actually, let me pick another Theme.
GID00073323	Sounds good to me.
GID00073353	I have some more Quantum for you.
GID00073354	What kind of recipes can you make with Nuka-Cola Quantum?
GID00073355	Has Ronald been bothering you?
GID00073356	What's it to you?
GID00073357	I was checking out Sierra's Nuka-Cola Collection.
GID00073358	Screw you, buddy! What are you, her husband?
GID00073359	She never said anything about you two being together.
GID00073360	I'm not messing with anything.
GID00073361	What are you driving at?
GID00073362	I don't have time for this nonsense.
GID00073363	Nope, I still don't get it.
GID00073364	That's disgusting!
GID00073365	Can't say I blame you.
GID00073366	Oh, really? Sounds interesting. Go on...
GID00073367	Just what is it you need me to do?
GID00073368	Look, I've got things to do. I'm not interested.
GID00073369	Yeah, sure. I'm always for making more caps.
GID00073370	Sorry, I'm not interested in your offer.
GID00073371	I found the shipping manifests and a map to go with it.
GID00073372	Did you know Ronald has offered to buy Quantum from me?
GID00073373	No, I think he just wants to get into your pants.
GID00073374	Never mind.
GID00073536	100 caps? This kid will make you ten times that. 300, and you've got a deal.
GID00073537	Make that 200 caps and you have yourself a deal.
GID00073538	Fine. You've got a deal.
GID00073539	Nah. Screw it. I'll go elsewhere.
GID00073540	I found an orphaned kid looking for a home. Would you take him in?
GID00073541	Let me think on it for a while.
GID00073542	I think Bryan will love his new home. I'll send him along shortly.
GID00073543	Surely your brilliance has devised a way for the robot to mingle with the Ants?
GID00073544	I can't leave you here alone. Let me find you a place to live.
GID00073545	Yeah, you'll be better off staying at home.
GID00073546	Let me think about it.
GID00073559	Yeah? I'll give you a hall pass, chrome dome.
GID00073560	Gee, Mr. Robot... I forgot my hall pass.
GID00073561	Ooh... shiny robot!
GID00073562	Maintence Code RHX-1W38. Override Authorization Challenge Protocol.
GID00073563	What the hell are you doing down here?
GID00073564	Hey! You're that egghe... I mean scientist the kid was talking about.
GID00073565	Creep up on YOU? I just crapped my pants for crying out loud!
GID00073566	Experiments? What do you mean?
GID00073567	You call this a laboratory?
GID00073568	How about we start the experiment by decorating that wall with your brains?
GID00073569	Oh, I see. You're trying to make them smaller over time by injecting the eggs.
GID00073570	Okay, now how about explaining that for the slower people?
GID00073571	Okay, okay. Enough with the mumbo jumbo.
GID00073572	So, what's gone wrong?
GID00073573	Are you aware your new ants breathe fire?!
GID00073574	So all that needs to be done is eliminate the remaining Ants?
GID00073575	An error? People have died, Lesko!
GID00073576	I'm sorry Doctor Lesko, but I think you're a crackpot.
GID00073577	I may be able to help, but it will cost you.
GID00073578	If it'll stop the ants from burning down Grayditch, I'm in.
GID00073579	Let me get back to you on this.
GID00073580	What else can you tell me about these Fire Ants?
GID00073581	How did you go from changing their size to breathing fire?
GID00073582	Will anything special hurt the Ants?
GID00073583	Is there anything you can tell me about your science robot?
GID00073586	I could use some food. Got anything for sale?
GID00073591	Come on, man. Are you sure I can't get up there?
GID00073592	Sure thing, Grouse. Here's the 100 caps.
GID00073593	Never mind. I don't want to get in that badly.
GID00073594	I guess I'll get going then.
GID00073615	Hey, relax, you were badly wounded. Now... who are you?
GID00073616	Sorry about being such a jerk, Reilly.
GID00073617	I'm not going to bug you anymore.
GID00073618	You don't scare me.
GID00073632	I'll stop whatever started this, I promise you.
GID00073633	This probably isn't the best place for you to stand...
GID00073634	Paradise Falls? What's that?
GID00073635	Slaves? Like people? That's appalling!
GID00073636	Yeah, whatever. Let's talk about something else.
GID00073637	I'm out of here. You people are sick.
GID00073638	I'll let my gun do the preaching.
GID00073639	Slaves, huh? Well, everyone's got to make a living.
GID00073640	So, can I head on up?
GID00073641	Never mind. It's not a place I want to be.
GID00073642	Is that your name?
GID00073643	Well, nice to meet you, err... Jotun.
GID00073644	What kind of stupid name is Jotun?
GID00073645	Nice to meet you, Jotun.
GID00073646	I'm injured. Help me out.
GID00073647	All right. Let's do this.
GID00073648	All right. Let's do it.
GID00073649	All right. Let's do it.
GID00073650	No. That'll do.
GID00073651	Actually, there was something else.
GID00073652	Actually, never mind.
GID00073653	I want to buy medical supplies.
GID00073654	Let me see your inventory.
GID00073668	Who are you?
GID00073677	So, what went wrong?
GID00073678	That stuff sounds absolutely revolting.
GID00073679	Wait, did you say it has an isotope in it? As in it's radioactive?
GID00073680	What's your interest in all this?
GID00073681	So, that's where I come in, I guess.
GID00073682	I take it this stuff is rare?
GID00073683	Okay, Sierra. You've got a deal.
GID00073684	Actually, I don't think I'm ready to do this now.
GID00073685	Sorry, I have to be on my way.
GID00073686	What do you know about the Nuka-Cola Bottling Facility?
GID00073687	Come on, Sierra. No secrets between friends! What's the special reward?
GID00073688	What do you know about Nuka-Cola Quantum?
GID00073689	Here's all the Nuka-Cola Quantum I'm carrying.
GID00073690	Do you even have a clue as to where I can start looking?
GID00073693	Quantum? Never heard of it before.
GID00073694	Just cut to the chase. What's this proposition?
GID00073707	Interested in buying some scrap metal?
GID00073708	I have 10 to sell.
GID00073709	I have 15 to sell.
GID00073710	I have 20 to sell.
GID00073711	I have 25 to sell.
GID00073712	I have 5 to sell.
GID00073713	Just take all the scrap metal I have.
GID00073714	Just take all the scrap metal I have. No charge. I just want to help
GID00073715	Actually, never mind.
GID00073716	What can I do to help around here?
GID00073717	How many leaks are there?
GID00073718	Can't you fix the pipes?
GID00073719	I'll keep it in mind.
GID00073720	I'm not your errand boy. Just pay me for the repairs.
GID00073721	Sounds good to me. I'll bring you the parts I find.
GID00073735	I have to get going now.
GID00073736	Nuka-Cola collection? Wow!
GID00073737	Yes, of course!
GID00073738	Nope. I'm not really interested in seeing your collection.
GID00073739	Ugh! I hate Nuka-Cola. That stuff is disgusting.
GID00073740	There's a Nuka-Cola Fan Club?
GID00073741	What kind of stuff do you collect, exactly?
GID00073742	Wait a minute. How many members are in your club?
GID00073743	Ugh, that sounds really disgusting!
GID00073744	Who's Ronald?
GID00073745	Wow, this conversation is getting boring...
GID00073746	I think you're crazy.
GID00073747	Tell me more about this Ronald guy.
GID00073748	Yeah, he sounds great. So, you mentioned a tour or something?
GID00073749	Um... Sierra...
GID00073750	Sierra! Please. I get it. He's tough.
GID00073751	No reason. I was just passing through.
GID00073752	I'm looking to make some cash. Any opportunities here?
GID00073753	Tell you what. You tell me first, and I'll consider taking the tour.
GID00073754	Why a blue bottle if the soda is brown? That's just weird.
GID00073755	The taste... I could never get used to it.
GID00073756	I just don't like it.
GID00073815	Before we talk about that, do you have my reward?
GID00073819	That's all I need to know for now.
GID00073877	All right, here's your money.
GID00073878	All right, here's your money.
GID00073879	All right, here's your money.
GID00073880	Never mind. I'll be fine.
GID00073881	You're a doctor, right? I could use some help.
GID00073882	That's ridiculous. I'm not paying you that much!
GID00073883	50 caps would still leave you with a nice profit. What do you say?
GID00073884	Come on, doc. I need help. 75 caps is better than nothing, right?
GID00073885	That's highway robbery. 100 caps is more than fair, don't you think?
GID00073893	Never mind. Go back to sleep.
GID00073895	Okay, that's enough.
GID00073896	Where can I get some food?
GID00073897	Where can I find a doctor?
GID00073898	Do you have a trader in town?
GID00073900	Friendly First Response
GID00073901	Rude First Response
GID00073911	Wake up. I need to talk to you.
GID00073920	What do you do around here, Winthrop?
GID00073921	Why? What's wrong?
GID00073922	Sure, Winthrop. I think I can help you out.
GID00073923	Take care of your own problems.
GID00073924	What sort of payment are we talking about?
GID00073925	I have a better idea. How about I do nothing and you give me what you have?
GID00073926	Yes. As in: I won't cut your throat and watch you die gasping for air.
GID00073927	You'll be dead long before help gets here.
GID00073928	Go ahead and yell. I'll kill every last one of you.
GID00073929	Heh. I was just kidding. Now, what were you saying about a job?
GID00073930	This is so fascinating, I can't bear to talk about it any longer.
GID00073931	You wanted me to get some Scrap Metal for you, right?
GID00073932	No, I haven't changed my mind.
GID00073933	What were you offering to trade?
GID00073934	Yes, I've changed my mind. I'll bring you some Scrap Metal
GID00073935	I have some scrap metal for you.
GID00073936	I've got 10 bits of Scrap Metal to trade.
GID00073937	I've got 15 bits of Scrap Metal to trade.
GID00073938	I've got 20 bits of Scrap Metal to trade.
GID00073939	I've got 25 bits of Scrap Metal to trade.
GID00073940	I've got 5 bits of Scrap Metal to trade.
GID00073941	What was our deal again?
GID00073942	Actually, never mind. I don't want to trade any Scrap Metal.
GID00073943	I'll take the RadAway.
GID00073944	I'll take the Stimpaks
GID00073945	I'll take some Rad-X.
GID00073946	I want to talk to you about Charon's contract.
GID00073947	I'll give you 1,000 caps for it.
GID00073948	I'll give you 2,000 caps for it.
GID00073949	I'll give you 3,000 caps for it.
GID00073950	I'll give you 4,000 caps for it.
GID00073951	I'll give you 5,000 caps for it.
GID00073952	I've changed my mind.
GID00073953	Couldn't we work out some sort of deal?
GID00073954	Why not just have Charon do it?
GID00073955	I want nothing to do with this.
GID00073956	Sure. Greta is nothing to me. I'll do it.
GID00073960	Oh no. None of that. You belong to me now.
GID00073961	Slow down, there. I have good news. I'm your new employer.
GID00073963	Whoa! What the fuck was that?
GID00073964	Sounds good. Let's get out of here.
GID00073965	I think we should travel together.
GID00073966	Time to head back into the fight, RL-3.
GID00073967	Time to head back into the fight, RL-3.
GID00073968	Time to head back into the fight, RL-3.
GID00073969	Let's travel together.
GID00073970	Let's travel together.
GID00073971	Come, Raul, adventure awaits!
GID00073972	Come, Raul, adventure awaits!
GID00073973	<Companion Protocol->Conflict::Rex>
GID00073974	<Companion Protocol::Begin>
GID00073975	Not just yet. I wanted to talk to you about something.
GID00073976	I just wanted to make sure you were still here. Goodbye.
GID00073977	Let's talk about your tactics.
GID00073978	<Tactics Interface::Open>
GID00073979	I want you to change your combat style.
GID00073980	<Combat Interface::Open>
GID00073981	Let's talk about something else.
GID00073982	<Tactics Interface::Close>
GID00073983	That's all. Let's get going.
GID00073984	<Control Interface::Close>
GID00073985	Switch to a melee weapon.
GID00073986	<Weapon Type::Melee>
GID00073987	<Weapon Type::Melee>
GID00073988	I want you to use ranged weapons.
GID00073989	<Weapon Type::Ranged>
GID00073990	<Weapon Type::Ranged>
GID00073991	Let's talk about how close you're following me.
GID00073992	<Follow Distance Protocol::Open>
GID00073993	Stick close to me.
GID00073994	Stay close to me.
GID00073995	<Follow Distance::Close>
GID00073996	Your distance is good. Let's talk about something else.
GID00073997	<Follow Distance Protocol::Close>
GID00073998	All right, you're good. Let's get out of here.
GID00073999	<Control Interface::Close>
GID00074000	Keep your distance. Try to flank them.
GID00074001	Keep your distance.
GID00074002	Keep your distance.
GID00074003	<Follow Distance::Far>
GID00074004	Enough about tactics.
GID00074005	Enough about tactics.
GID00074006	<Tactics Interface::Open>
GID00074007	No. Let's go.
GID00074008	Yes, let's talk about something else.
GID00074009	No. Let's go.
GID00074010	Yes, let's talk about something else.
GID00074030	People die all the time out here. Get used to it.
GID00074031	Do you think Reilly will be okay?
GID00074032	Can you revive Reilly? I don't think I'm capable.
GID00074033	Please, Doc! She obviously needs someone's help.
GID00074034	Forget it!
GID00074035	If you revive her, I can find out what happened. Maybe even help her!
GID00074036	Amazing! Do you think it will really work?
GID00074037	Interesting.
GID00074038	A Ghoul that wants to be human? That's a good one!
GID00074039	What can you tell me about Reilly?
GID00074040	Why does Doctor Barrows care so much about humans, anyway?
GID00074041	You seem to be taking very good care of her.
GID00074042	He's experimenting on her? That's twisted!
GID00074043	Has he met with any success?
GID00074044	It's nice that you care so much.
GID00074045	Hmph. I thought Ghouls hated humans.
GID00074046	Why not?
GID00074047	What exactly is the doctor trying to do? You can tell me.
GID00074048	You look terrible. Maybe I shouldn't have woken you up so quickly.
GID00074049	You've been in a coma... chances are the Rangers are already dead.
GID00074050	Why don't you attempt a rescue? Your legs broken or something?
GID00074051	Combat Armor isn't going to do it for me. Got anything else?
GID00074052	Nah, I guess I'll go with the armor. Sounds like you've got a deal.
GID00074053	Sounds like you have a deal.
GID00074061	Ok, I'll do it.
GID00074062	Look, I really don't want to kill you...
GID00074063	Can I have some time to think about it?
GID00074069	Wow! That's what I've always wanted to be. My dreams are finally coming true!
GID00074070	Whatever. I just answered randomly. Is that how you got stuck with your job?
GID00074071	That can't be right! The stupid test got it all wrong!
GID00074077	Who else lived in Grayditch?
GID00074078	Did you hear anyone mention anything about an Ant Queen?
GID00074079	Are you kidding me? Hell would have been a damn picnic!
GID00074080	You're damn right I do!
GID00074097	Do you remember the day the war started?
GID00074098	What was the Wasteland like after the war?
GID00074099	So, how did you end up as a Ghoul?
GID00074100	See, and you said you weren't interesting.
GID00074111	I suppose nothing beats a real-world example. I'll get myself irradiated.
GID00074112	Spy on what? Your trailer-home?
GID00074113	Maybe you should take a minute to listen to yourself...
GID00074127	What can you tell me about yourself?
GID00074128	So he's your slave?
GID00074129	He doesn't say much, does he?
GID00074130	He's a loyal employee? What do you mean?
GID00074131	What does he do for you?
GID00074132	Let's talk about something else.
GID00074133	Let me see the real goods.
GID00074134	Look at these people. They're Jetting. Trust me, I know.
GID00074135	Why do you bother to hide what you sell?
GID00074136	Just show me the goods.
GID00074137	Then I guess I'll take my caps someplace else...
GID00074138	Why do you bother to hide what you sell?
GID00074139	Just show me the goods.
GID00074140	How did you end up here?
GID00074141	No, Carol. I'd love to hear your story.
GID00074142	You know, you're right. I don't.
GID00074143	How did you end up working for...
GID00074159	I'm taking a break from the research.
GID00074160	Basic Sly Response
GID00074161	Bonus Sly Response
GID00074163	I'm ready to pass along the secrets of my former nation, Mister President.
GID00074170	Did you just ask for some water? <Give purified water.>
GID00074240	Could I help with the election, Mister President?
GID00074300	Why don't we all split it? There's really no point in getting killed for it.
GID00074301	I'm taking the water. All of it. And don't try to stop me.
GID00074302	Listen, for a share of the water I'll help you take out those jokers.
GID00074303	It's none of my business. I'm just passing through.
GID00074305	You should go vote, if you haven't already.
GID00074308	Sure, I can spare some water. <Give 1 water.>
GID00074309	Then I guess you're done for, because I'm not giving you any.
GID00074310	I don't have any water to spare, but I'll be back when I find some.
GID00074325	Have you heard the election results?
GID00074328	He's lucky Gomez stopped the fight before I really hurt him.
GID00074329	The jerk tried to steal my sweetroll.
GID00074330	It was kind of my fault. You know how easy it is to make Butch mad...
GID00074331	He wanted my sweetroll, but I told him off. <Lie.>
GID00074332	He, um... He made me give him my sweetroll.
GID00074333	I don't want to talk about it.
GID00074334	Don't worry about me. I'm not scared of him.
GID00074335	I wouldn't give him what he wanted. He says he's going to make me sorry later.
GID00074336	Your dad's the Overseer. Can't you talk to him about Butch?
GID00074338	Looks like all the votes are in, Mister President.
GID00074339	Bryan, I'm sorry, but your father is dead.
GID00074340	Your father's dead.
GID00074341	Sorry, kid. Your old man is ant food.
GID00074342	Fine, I'll take care of everything.
GID00074343	My part in this is all done. Sorry, kid.
GID00074345	I need medical supplies.
GID00074346	Where can I get a drink around here? You seem like the right person to ask.
GID00074347	So, you're the town drunk, huh?
GID00074348	You're losing parts? Like... body parts?
GID00074349	I'll do that.
GID00074350	Watch out for your own body parts, you creepy bastard.
GID00074351	You keep your parts to yourself and let's talk about something else.
GID00074352	Are you all right?
GID00074353	You be careful. I don't want you hurting yourself.
GID00074354	You're disgusting.
GID00074355	What? You're not going to tell me how rare it is to see a human in Underworld?
GID00074356	Where do you go?
GID00074357	Wow, I just realized... I don't care.
GID00074358	Nice to meet you, Quinn.
GID00074359	Travel? Where do you go?
GID00074360	Oh, I just remembered... I don't care.
GID00074361	Oh, God. I'm out of here.
GID00074362	Tell me about your travels, Quinn.
GID00074364	What do you do with the money you make down here?
GID00074375	I think I get the idea. Let me ask you something else.
GID00074376	You should go vote, if you haven't already.
GID00074377	I'd like to discuss the election with you.
GID00074378	What's new?
GID00074379	What's your take on the Republic?
GID00074380	I need you to repair my equipment.
GID00074381	Setting the record straight is exactly my goal.
GID00074382	You were on the City Council? That's hard to believe.
GID00074383	So, you used to be in charge? How did you end up here?
GID00074384	If that's so, why are you stuck down here?
GID00074385	Do you have any hard evidence of all this?
GID00074386	I can't imagine why she'd be more popular. Even assuming this is all true.
GID00074387	Those what? What's the matter?
GID00074388	Calm down, kid.
GID00074389	What the heck is your problem?
GID00074390	Hey, hey. Calm down. It's going to be okay. I promise.
GID00074391	Hey, kid. It's okay. I'm a big, tough guy. I can take care of you!
GID00074392	Look, kid. There's no such thing as monsters.
GID00074393	Unless you tell me what the problem is I can't help you.
GID00074394	Okay kid. I'm going to say it once. Stop your whining!
GID00074396	All right, I'm sorry. Calm down and tell me what's going on.
GID00074397	I'd like to help, but I need to know more first.
GID00074398	Sorry, kid. Help costs caps, and you look pretty broke to me.
GID00074399	Don't be like that. I'm sorry for being mean.
GID00074400	Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
GID00074401	What's it going to take for you to forgive me?
GID00074402	Forget it, I don't care. I'm out of here.
GID00074403	<Sigh.> Okay. I'm sorry.
GID00074404	Okay. "I'm sorry three times!" Ha! That's exactly what you said to say!
GID00074405	Did you know the others in town very well?
GID00074406	Is there anywhere you can hide while I search?
GID00074407	Okay kid, I said I'd do it. Now scram!
GID00074408	Can you tell me more about the things attacking Grayditch?
GID00074409	Anything else you can remember about them?
GID00074410	Have they always been around?
GID00074411	Is there any special way to hurt them?
GID00074412	Where are your parents?
GID00074413	Don't worry about it, sir. It was nothing.
GID00074414	He tried to take my birthday present!
GID00074415	Really, I was the one who started it. It wasn't his fault.
GID00074447	Mrs. Palmer said I didn't have to share. Since it's my birthday...
GID00074448	How about we share it? Half for me, half for you. That's fair, right?
GID00074449	You can have it. I don't even like sweetrolls.
GID00074450	Sure, Butch. <Spit on the sweetroll and give it to him.>
GID00074451	Go soak your head, Butch. I'm not giving you my sweetroll.
GID00074452	You do look hungry. What, your mom drank up all the ration coupons again?
GID00074453	I threw it away. But you're welcome to eat it off the floor if you want.
GID00074454	Mmmm... It sure was good when I ate it a few minutes ago.
GID00074455	What am I supposed to do?
GID00074456	Nobody talks to me that way.
GID00074461	Do you have any more of those Mirelurk bait grenades?
GID00074462	Okay, I can tell how much it means to you. Let's get this book finished.
GID00074463	Yes, I really do.
GID00074464	No. It's a terrible idea. Don't even try.
GID00074465	Well, it's a big undertaking, and we've got to make sure we do it right.
GID00074466	What do you mean about your other projects? Have there been problems?
GID00074467	I think you're right. Now, let's get back to work on this book!
GID00074468	Okay, but it could be bad if the book's misleading. People could get hurt.
GID00074469	Moira, please don't write the book. It will just turn out badly.
GID00074470	It's really good of you to try to help people like this.
GID00074471	It sounds like you don't know what you're doing.
GID00074472	Well, I'm proud to be a part of it. You can count on me!
GID00074473	I don't know. Those caravans help a lot of people.
GID00074474	Seriously, don't waste time with this book. Stick to helping the caravans.
GID00074475	So you're trying to make the world better than it was?
GID00074476	I don't know. Human nature doesn't change like that.
GID00074477	But why try with this book, when you could be helping out in real ways here?
GID00074478	You don't have the experience for a book like this. You'll be a laughingstock.
GID00074479	It will just get us hurt. You don't want to hurt anyone, do you?
GID00074480	Yes, I really do.
GID00074482	No, of course not!
GID00074483	I don't consider myself a spy so much as... your assassin.
GID00074484	I was just looking around.
GID00074485	I'm sorry. I'll just be leaving...
GID00074486	Sir, I was hoping you would reconsider your decision.
GID00074487	If you'll excuse me a moment, I'll be right back.
GID00074488	Your father was a monarch? You mean like the butterfly?
GID00074489	I'd say it looks more like a dictatorship.
GID00074490	I really wouldn't know. I just got here.
GID00074491	Yes, absolutely.
GID00074492	So, your father was a monarch and you're a president? How does that work?
GID00074493	I've got to go.
GID00074494	Who's running in the election?
GID00074496	I have some other questions...
GID00074497	Can you take me to see Dave?
GID00074498	I don't think you should be in charge of anything.
GID00074499	I think you should go for it.
GID00074500	You're too young to take Dave's place, anyway.
GID00074503	It could be pretty tough, I guess.
GID00074504	It's not a betrayal. This is a free, um, nation... right?
GID00074505	Is it because you're too stupid to be President?
GID00074506	Have you considered running for the presidency?
GID00074507	Yes, ma'am.
GID00074508	Oh, you didn't have to bring me a present, Mrs. Palmer.
GID00074509	I hope you brought me something better than last year.
GID00074513	I just...
GID00074514	Yeah, but...
GID00074518	When are Angela and Diego getting married?
GID00074525	Wait, who's this Dave guy, and why does he have his own Republic?
GID00074526	Actually, I think I have all the info I need.
GID00074527	Tell me more about this Dave guy.
GID00074528	I need a drink.
GID00074529	What's on the menu?
GID00074530	Jesus Christ! What are you?
GID00074531	Smoothskin? What does that mean?
GID00074532	Where am I?
GID00074533	The Brotherhood of Steel? What's your beef with them?
GID00074534	A city full of Ghouls, huh?
GID00074535	Yeah, he's up in Megaton tending bar.
GID00074536	Yeah, he's in Megaton working for some jackass.
GID00074543	I took a little peek at the files in your computer. Tell me about the android.
GID00074544	You should write your music down, to keep it preserved for the future.
GID00074545	It doesn't matter. Everything gets lost with time.
GID00074546	You aren't going to live forever, you know.
GID00074547	What do you need to get it done?
GID00074548	Then stop whining about it, and do it!
GID00074549	Music paper? Let me guess... you don't have any.
GID00074550	Paper? Why not record it on a holotape?
GID00074551	Let me get back with you on this.
GID00074552	No, no. Having you write it down is reward enough.
GID00074553	Sure, I'll take whatever you can afford.
GID00074554	It better be good. I busted my ass getting that paper.
GID00074555	No, no, no. You keep it. You may need it!
GID00074556	Thanks, Agatha. It's more than I expected.
GID00074557	I suppose this one is a freebie too, eh?
GID00074558	Sure, I'll get the paper for you.
GID00074559	You have anything for sale?
GID00074560	Here you go. Let's get out of here.
GID00074561	Actually, never mind. I don't need your help.
GID00074566	About that deal we had... Greta is dead, as promised.
GID00074567	Yeah... Killing. Stealing. Sounds fun, doesn't it?
GID00074568	You should come with me. I could use a hand.
GID00074569	You're right. That sounds terrible.
GID00074570	So you're trapped in there, inside this Herbert... I mean Bob... thing?
GID00074571	I'm beginning to suspect you weren't always this way.
GID00074572	What in the hell are you talking about?
GID00074573	How did a tree end up growing out of your head?
GID00074574	A genetic mutation of that magnitude could only be caused by F.E.V.
GID00074575	How on Earth did that happen?
GID00074576	I still don't understand what the hell you're talking about.
GID00074577	Well, hopefully your troubles will be over. I'm here to help.
GID00074578	So, the Treeminders said you needed my help?
GID00074579	Look, let's cut the bullshit and get to the matter at hand.
GID00074580	You want me to murder you?
GID00074581	Kill you? You can't be serious!
GID00074582	Sure. Where do you want the bullet, head or gut?
GID00074583	How would I be able to kill you? You're a tree.
GID00074584	If I kill you, every Treeminder will come after me.
GID00074585	Why don't you just kill yourself?
GID00074586	Uh, I think I saw them about two miles south of here.
GID00074587	How are you feeling, Agatha?
GID00074588	I have to be on my way.
GID00074589	Would you mind playing the violin for me?
GID00074590	No, I haven't seen any slaves around here.
GID00074591	Maybe I have. What's it worth to you?
GID00074592	Yeah, they're hiding right around the corner.
GID00074593	They're just around the corner. You can't miss them.
GID00074594	Actually, I don't know where they are. But thanks for the caps.
GID00074620	Have you ever considered getting back out there?
GID00074621	Out there in the Wastes, man. You must be bored to tears in this town.
GID00074622	You know what? Forget I said anything.
GID00074623	I was talking about the Wastes. You must be going crazy in this place.
GID00074635	I don't understand. Crazy experiments are what keep you going?
GID00074638	I've never met a talking tree before.
GID00074639	Okay. What's the trick? I know there's a guy with a microphone somewhere.
GID00074640	They're worshipping a tree? Ha ha ha!
GID00074641	What do you mean "fresh human samples"?
GID00074642	Stay away from me, you freak!
GID00074643	No, no. Nothing like that.
GID00074644	Sorry, I aim to keep all my samples to myself.
GID00074645	Touch me and I yell zombie.
GID00074646	I'm injured. Anything you can do for me?
GID00074647	Okay, here are the caps. <Give 300 Caps.>
GID00074648	Here you go. <Give 200 Caps.>
GID00074649	It's all here. <Give 100 Caps.>
GID00074650	Hmmm... I don't think so.
GID00074664	I'm afraid I've lost my Geomapper...
GID00074665	We all make mistakes, Reilly. You're not a fortune teller.
GID00074666	Shit happens, Reilly. Get used to it.
GID00074667	No, Theo died because of bad luck. That's all.
GID00074668	Theo died because he was careless.
GID00074669	Let me help. You stay here and I'll do some mapping for you.
GID00074670	Well, looks like you're on your own then.
GID00074671	Sure. Why not. You look like you need the help.
GID00074672	Well, yeah. I expect to be paid a merc's wage, though.
GID00074673	Done deal. I'll locate as many as I can for you.
GID00074674	As long as the caps flow, you'll get your maps.
GID00074675	What's been happening since you've been back?
GID00074676	I have some mapping data for you.
GID00074677	Yeah, I think I'm hurt.
GID00074678	Yeah, my equipment has seen better days.
GID00074679	Well, okay then.
GID00074680	Ah, I get it! You're crazy.
GID00074681	Well, it's good to meet you, Jack.
GID00074682	Thanks, Jack. Maybe I'll do that.
GID00074683	Yeah... maybe not. I don't want to catch whatever you have.
GID00074684	Yeah... you're a little too chipper for my tastes. I'm out of here.
GID00074685	Okay, this is boring.
GID00074686	I'm sure you two will be great together.
GID00074687	A couple? Is that what you mean?
GID00074688	I think "weird as all hell" is probably the best way to describe it.
GID00074689	I really don't know.
GID00074690	I don't know, he doesn't seem very smart to me.
GID00074691	Yeah, he's a pretty smart guy.
GID00074692	I really don't care.
GID00074693	Best town in the USA? How many towns compete in that contest?
GID00074694	Well, I can certainly see why.
GID00074696	I'm from an underground Vault, lady. Trust me, this place sucks.
GID00074697	Actually, I guess it isn't so bad.
GID00074698	I was just joking. It's a lovely place.
GID00074699	What, what?
GID00074700	Whoa, slow down, grandpa. What's wrong?
GID00074701	You know, there is something a bit "off" about them...
GID00074702	Well, I'll be careful, I guess.
GID00074703	Shhh.... time for a nap, gramps.
GID00074704	What's wrong with being friendly?
GID00074705	You're right. I hate friendly people.
GID00074706	I don't know, it seems like a pretty nice place to me.
GID00074707	Yeah... you go get some sleep, crazy old man. I'll be going now...
GID00074708	What's wrong with that Harris guy?
GID00074709	He said you were all crazy killers.
GID00074710	Well, okay then. Nothing to worry about.
GID00074711	Wait... He's your dad?
GID00074712	It's true. And they smell funny.
GID00074713	The families around here seem very close.
GID00074714	No, I mean, really close.
GID00074715	Doesn't that make you all cousins?
GID00074716	Well... okay... whatever works for you.
GID00074717	I guess it's none of my business.
GID00074720	Is that what you said to Jonas before you killed him? Time to die, old man.
GID00074721	My father's no traitor. But you're a murderer and a thug.
GID00074722	All right. We'll do it your way. I surrender. <Give him your weapons.>
GID00074723	I'm afraid the Vault will just have to get along without you. Time to die.
GID00074724	You've convinced me. Hand over your keys and password, and I'll be on my way.
GID00074728	If you don't mind my asking, what do human brains taste like?
GID00074729	Zombies couldn't make a place like Underworld.
GID00074730	This has been fun, but I've got things to do.
GID00074740	I really don't know what you're talking about, Jack...
GID00074741	Yes, and I saw what you're hiding down there, you sick bastard!
GID00074742	Bring home the bacon? Those are people, not bacon! What the fuck?
GID00074743	I can't believe I'm being called a potty mouth by a cannibal...
GID00074744	Seriously, you're talking about eating people, here. What's wrong with you?
GID00074745	Wait... are you saying you eat those people?
GID00074746	Huh. Well, everyone's got to survive in their own way, I guess.
GID00074747	I almost grabbed a snack while I was there, but that would have been rude.
GID00074748	Yes, I was in the basement.
GID00074749	You know, now that you mention it, there were a bunch of bodies down there.
GID00074750	Nope. Not at all.
GID00074751	Yes, I did. And you're going to die for it.
GID00074762	Just give me the keys to your office and your password. Then I'll be going.
GID00074763	You're right. You will die if you don't give me that password.
GID00074764	Amata trusts me. If you don't give me what I want, I'll hurt her. Bad.
GID00074765	I'll escape without your help, then. I'm not the one who started killing people.
GID00074766	If you ever lay a hand on Amata again, I'll make you regret it.
GID00074767	I'm here to kill you. Jonas was my friend.
GID00074768	Where can I find Scribe Jameson?
GID00074769	All right then.
GID00074770	What are the Scrolls that you mentioned?
GID00074771	Where can I find Holotags?
GID00074772	Why can't you send your own people to find the Holotags?
GID00074773	What's my reward if I bring you these Holotags?
GID00074774	Let's talk about something else.
GID00074775	Actually, never mind.
GID00074776	I had a few questions about them.
GID00074777	I've found some Holotags.
GID00074778	Sure, I've got all the time in the world.
GID00074779	And without radio equipment, you can't keep track of them?
GID00074780	You can't keep track of your own damn soldiers? Who runs this place?
GID00074781	<Yawn.>
GID00074782	How about we skip the story and you just tell me what you want.
GID00074783	Frankly, I don't give a damn.
GID00074815	Tell me more about the pay.
GID00074816	I've got plenty of my own problems to worry about.

GID00074820	Hannibal Hamlin is dead.
GID00074823	I got you the slave you wanted. I can get into Paradise Falls now, right?
GID00074827	I don't have time to play games. Here's 200 caps. Let me in.
GID00074828	You want a fucking resume? Just tell me what to do, asshole.
GID00074829	It can't be that hard, can it? I mean, you're a Slaver after all...
GID00074830	I can enslave criminals and the like, right? I don't have to enslave innocents?
GID00074831	I can try getting that collar off. But it might explode if I tinker with it.
GID00074833	I was just kidding. You're a slave. Deal with it.
GID00074834	You're a slave. Deal with it.
GID00074835	I need another collar so I can get more slaves.
GID00074841	Well, I've got the food. But no luck with the medicine.
GID00074842	It wasn't easy, but I got the food and the medicine.
GID00074843	There was a Raider camp in the store. And a robot at the pharmacy.
GID00074844	I've been bit too busy for that.
GID00074845	Hold on. I need to know more before I agree to anything.
GID00074846	Wait. How? I mean, how many people even read anymore?
GID00074847	Sounds like a great idea! I can't wait to help!
GID00074848	I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass. Sorry.

GID00074861	Actually, I'll have to wait a bit.
GID00074871	Why aren't you dressed?
GID00074872	If he's that bad, come with me. I'll protect you.
GID00074873	So what's the deal with Dukov?
GID00074874	Does he pay you for this?
GID00074877	Thanks for the warning.
GID00074879	I'm sorry Reilly... None of them made it. I did the best I could.
GID00074880	I'm sorry we lost Brick.
GID00074881	I'm sorry we lost Brick and Butcher.
GID00074882	I'm sorry we lost Brick and Donavan.
GID00074883	I'm sorry we lost Butcher.
GID00074884	I'm sorry we lost Butcher and Donavan.
GID00074885	I'm sorry we lost Donovan.
GID00074886	It went extremely well, as you can see. We didn't lose anyone.
GID00074887	Nah. It was all in a day's work.
GID00074888	Yeah. That was a tough run.
GID00074889	No, please continue... Your men are more important than my reward.
GID00074890	Yeah, please. I have much to do.
GID00074891	What about my reward?
GID00074892	Hey, what about my damn reward?
GID00074894	Sounds simple enough.
GID00074896	I am seeking asylum, Mister President.
GID00074897	I seek citizenship in the Republic of Dave.
GID00074898	I'm just a traveler. I guess you could say I'm vacationing.
GID00074899	Mister Crowley is alive. He sent me to kill you because you hate Ghouls.
GID00074900	Thank you for sharing your wisdom, Mister President.
GID00074901	Not good enough, Mister President.
GID00074902	What happened in the Fort, Mister President?
GID00074903	A gift of the key would be a strategic diplomatic move, Mister President.
GID00074904	How did Mister Crowley die, Mister President?
GID00074905	Crowley is alive, Mister President. I'm supposed to bring him the key.
GID00074906	I think I'd like to meet Dave.
GID00074907	I'm just a wanderer. I'll be going now.
GID00074908	I'm not here to hurt anyone. What is this place?
GID00074909	Um... I don't think so. I'll stay out here.
GID00074917	There's a pack of Feral Ghouls in the courtyard!
GID00074918	The day isn't complete until I've killed something.
GID00074919	No way. I'm going to keep those keys for myself.
GID00074920	More caps? You've got a deal.
GID00074921	Those people you sent me to kill aren't Ghoul haters...
GID00074922	Mister Crowley is alive. I'm here to kill you because you hate Ghouls.
GID00074923	You've satisfied my curiosity.
GID00074924	I want more than that to spare your miserable life. 300 caps.
GID00074925	How did he die?
GID00074926	I think it would be better for everyone if I just killed you.
GID00074927	200 caps to spare your life? Okay.
GID00074928	Dad couldn't have really left the Vault! That's impossible...
GID00074930	Dad couldn't have really left the Vault! That's impossible...
GID00074931	My Dad can't have really left the Vault. That's impossible.
GID00074932	My Dad can't have left. The door is sealed shut.
GID00074936	Yeah, Brick... You really, um, ventilated them...
GID00074937	Has anyone ever spoken to you about anger management?
GID00074938	Wow, you're certifiably insane, huh?
GID00074939	Nah. I've got things to do. But thanks for the compliment.
GID00074940	That would be great. Maybe I'll speak to Reilly about it.
GID00074941	Well, since I saved your ass, shouldn't you be joining me?
GID00074942	Here, I brought you some ammo.
GID00074948	I've reconsidered your offer. I'll kill those Ghoul-hating bigots for you.
GID00074949	Who are those girls? And where are their clothes?
GID00074951	Who put you in charge?
GID00074952	We'll chat about stuff later. We have to get out of here, right now!
GID00074953	Okay, fine. Yes, she's alive. She's safe in Underworld. Satisfied?
GID00074954	Doesn't look like the elevator works anymore.
GID00074955	Are there any other ways off this roof?
GID00074956	Okay, I'll go back and look for the Fission Battery.
GID00074957	Why don't one of you come with me?
GID00074958	Guess what? You're in luck. I have the power cell.
GID00074959	I have a Fission Battery that will fix that express elevator.
GID00074960	How have you guys survived up here?
GID00074961	Any clue where I can find a Fission Battery?
GID00074962	Who's that guy in the clinic?
GID00074963	Maybe I can help him.
GID00074964	Why keep him alive? Don't you need the supplies you're using on him?
GID00074965	You let a dying man use supplies you need? You're a bunch of morons.
GID00074966	I'm just saying, it's an option.
GID00074967	Whoa, take it easy. I was just asking.
GID00074968	Let's talk about something else.
GID00074969	Easy now. I've got nothing against Ghouls.
GID00074970	Fucking brain eater!
GID00074971	Milk sucking? You shuffle stepping, brain eating, grave loving zombie!
GID00074972	Hey! I'm just looking to trade a drink for some gossip.
GID00074973	All true, except for the part about the mutants, the water and the whore.
GID00074974	So what can you tell me about Underworld?
GID00074975	I can help you defend yourselves.
GID00074976	If you can arm yourselves, I can teach you how to shoot.
GID00074977	I'll stick around to kill the Super Mutants. They should leave you alone after that.
GID00074978	I'll teach you how to sneak and hide. They'll think you've deserted the town.
GID00074979	You could set up a minefield to keep Super Mutants from just strolling in.
GID00074980	Law of the Wasteland: Survival of the fittest. You're on your own. Good luck!
GID00074981	You should have some robot defenders. I can show you what to do with them.
GID00074982	I can help you defend against the Super Mutants, but it will cost you.
GID00074987	I'm sorry, I'm ready now.
GID00074988	I've changed my mind. I'm not quite ready.
GID00074989	I'm leaving. This is just crazy.
GID00074990	If you hate technology, why carry weapons?
GID00074991	Shun technology? How do you defend yourselves?
GID00074992	Yeah, sure. I guess that's why Maple stuck a rifle in my face...
GID00074993	Okay, let's begin the ceremony.
GID00074994	Could we wait just a bit? I'm not quite ready.
GID00074995	Forget this whole thing. This is insane!
GID00074996	Which brings us to why I'm here, I suppose.
GID00074997	Fine, fine. Get to the point already.
GID00074998	I would be honored to meet this person.
GID00074999	And where can I find this person?
GID00075000	Okay already. Let's get this going.
GID00075001	Just a minute... What does this ceremony involve?
GID00075002	Hang on, you never said anything about a ceremony!
GID00075003	Can't we skip all this nonsense?
GID00075004	I'm ready to undertake the ceremony.
GID00075005	Sounds like a normal guy.
GID00075006	Oh look! I dropped these 50 caps in your pocket...
GID00075007	Not for the right cause.
GID00075008	What can you tell me about Mister Crowley?
GID00075009	Can your table handle 200 caps?
GID00075010	You can give me the key, or I can take it. Your choice.
GID00075011	I'm a little short on caps right now.
GID00075012	Actually, Crowley is alive. He wants some sort of security key you have.
GID00075013	Where did he die?
GID00075015	Um... I should go.
GID00075016	Come on. You can tell me. Ahzrukhal said so. <Lie.>
GID00075017	Sure. People like that don't deserve to live.
GID00075018	I'll give you 25 caps for that key.
GID00075019	I've learned what I came for. Thank you.
GID00075020	Thanks for the info. I'm just trying to sort all of this out.
GID00075021	Give me that key. I'd hate to see you bleed to death.
GID00075022	Mister Crowley wants your father's security key.
GID00075023	Do you know what they were doing at the fort?
GID00075024	Can you think of any reason he might want you dead?
GID00075025	I don't like where this is headed.
GID00075026	Okay. What's the plan?
GID00075027	I'm afraid this is it.
GID00075028	No time for chatter. I'm here to get you guys out.
GID00075029	Yeah, she's fine. They patched her up and she's resting in Underworld.
GID00075031	Any good news about the area?
GID00075033	What's wrong with her?
GID00075034	How did she end up in the Chop Shop?
GID00075035	Do you think there's any way to revive her?
GID00075036	Do you mind if I try and revive her?
GID00075037	I'd really like to speak to this woman. Please, wake her now.
GID00075038	How do I know they're still alive?
GID00075039	Where is Theo's body?
GID00075040	So, what's this about needing help? Tell me the whole story.
GID00075041	Let me guess, more Super Mutants inside?
GID00075042	Not a very smart move, if you ask me.
GID00075043	Bad move, I'm guessing.
GID00075044	Trapped yourself at the top of a tall building. Brilliant.
GID00075045	Last stand?
GID00075046	Look, I could care less about your stories.
GID00075047	So that leaves them up there. How come you're here?
GID00075048	I don't know, Reilly. This sounds like suicide.
GID00075049	What's in it for me if I risk my neck for you?
GID00075050	What did you need from me?
GID00075051	Hang on, I'll be back
GID00075052	Sorry, I don't think I can help you.
GID00075053	I need some time to think about it.
GID00075054	All right. I'll do it.
GID00075055	Can you think of anything that will help me get there?
GID00075056	What can you tell me about Vernon Square?
GID00075057	Tell me more about Reilly's Rangers.
GID00075058	Trouble? What kind of trouble?
GID00075059	Why don't you leave?
GID00075060	Who lives here?
GID00075061	I'm sure you'll manage.
GID00075062	So, it's pretty much a free-for-all here? Where do you keep your good stuff?
GID00075063	Kill you? Sounds like fun. Let's do that.
GID00075064	Not bad, kid. I'll let you live... for now.
GID00075065	Keep your secret. I wouldn't want to take advantage of you.
GID00075066	So what's this secret?
GID00075079	Come on. Follow me.
GID00075080	You wait here. I'll be right back.
GID00075086	I've never seen anyplace like this.
GID00075087	This place is weird. Where do you plug stuff in?
GID00075088	This place scares me. It's so... different.
GID00075089	Who is it you keep referring to as "Him"?
GID00075090	I wish you could just tell me who "He" is, already...
GID00075091	Can you cut the "Him" crap already and just tell me who he is?
GID00075092	Why do you call yourselves Treeminders?
GID00075093	Treeminders, huh? That's a strange name.
GID00075094	I think you're all a bunch of lunatics.
GID00075095	So what was all this about meeting someone?
GID00075096	Just a minute. Who are you and what is this place?
GID00075097	I'm not following anyone until I know what's going on here.
GID00075098	Ha ha ha! What the hell are you wearing?
GID00075099	Whoa, whoa. Slow down, old man. What the hell are you babbling about?
GID00075100	Sure, lead on.
GID00075101	Who's waiting for me inside?
GID00075103	I'm not following anyone. I need to be on my way.
GID00075104	Okay, I'll follow you. Lead on.
GID00075105	No way! You're obviously out of your mind!
GID00075106	Perhaps some other time. I have more urgent matters to attend to.
GID00075107	Yes, I'd like to speak to Tree Father Birch.
GID00075108	No, maybe some other time.
GID00075109	I don't suppose there's more you can tell me about Oasis?
GID00075111	Allistair Tenpenny is already dead.
GID00075112	Sure. Take it. I don't have any use for it.
GID00075113	I'm here to kill you, and there's nothing you can do about it.
GID00075114	Um... I don't have it.
GID00075115	Your mom's already done for. You'd better run before those Roaches come for you.
GID00075116	You're big. They're little. Just go back in there and squish them. Be a hero!
GID00075117	Forget I mentioned it.
GID00075118	I told Simms I'd disarm it. Maybe some extra caps would change my mind...
GID00075120	Ooh, I could be a Tunnel Snake!? Good luck with the Roaches. I'm out of here.
GID00075127	Fine. I'll save your mom.
GID00075128	Here, take my BB Gun. You don't need to be scared of the Roaches now.
GID00075129	Sorry, Butch. You're on your own. I've got to go.
GID00075138	All right, let's go to Big Town.
GID00075145	I'm not playing this game.
GID00075155	All right. I'll help. But I'm doing this for your mom, not for you.
GID00075156	Why do you need my help, anyway? Afraid of a few Radroaches?
GID00075157	Actually, I can leave her for the Radroaches. Just watch me.
GID00075159	How about I just kill them all?
GID00075160	Never heard of it. Is it a ruin around here?
GID00075161	Never heard of him. If I find anything, though, I'll be sure to show it to you.
GID00075162	So if I find anything like that, you might buy it from me?
GID00075163	You wait here. Let me investigate first.
GID00075164	Bittercup? That's the dumbest name I've ever heard!
GID00075165	I'm sorry... erm... Bittercup. What were you saying?
GID00075166	I don't know about that, but Bittercup is one dumbass name.
GID00075168	Nice to meet you, Bittercup.
GID00075169	This seems like a strange thing to worry about right now.
GID00075177	Okay, I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me.
GID00075179	Are you crazy or something?
GID00075180	Is there anything else interesting to see near Girdershade?
GID00075183	I'd rather keep it.
GID00075184	How much will you pay for this poster of the Lincoln Memorial?
GID00075185	Are you interested in buying a recording of Lincoln's voice?
GID00075186	Would you like to make an offer on Lincoln's Rifle?
GID00075187	It's a deal.
GID00075188	So I'm a prisoner? I don't think so!
GID00075189	Maybe. How much is it worth to find these slaves for you?
GID00075190	I've found Hannibal Hamlin.
GID00075191	If I find them, you'll be the first to know.
GID00075192	My mistake. I'll just be going.
GID00075193	I haven't seen any slaves recently.
GID00075194	I'm just looking for a place to rest, and maybe do some trading.
GID00075195	I've got no beef with you. Let me go and I won't say a word.
GID00075197	Who are you guys?
GID00075198	If I had, I wouldn't tell you.
GID00075199	I found a love letter. I think you'll want to see it.
GID00075201	Tell me where Fort Constantine is.
GID00075202	Have you got what I want?
GID00075203	I put a bullet right between Ted Strayer's eyes. <Lie.>
GID00075204	This whole deal sounds fishy. What do you really want?
GID00075205	What do you have against these guys?
GID00075207	How are things now that the power's back?
GID00075209	Who the hell are you?
GID00075210	Okay, you are officially weirding me out.
GID00075211	You're a crazy bastard, aren't you?
GID00075218	RaiderTalkDon'tLookAtMe1
GID00075219	RaiderTalkDon'tLookAtMe2
GID00075232	Don't worry, Butch. I'll get your mom out of there.
GID00075233	Are you saying you're afraid of the dark?
GID00075237	Come on. Let's go see if we can help her.
GID00075238	Butch... asking me for help. If only you knew what "irony" meant...
GID00075239	Sorry, Butch. I've got my own problems to deal with right now.
GID00075260	So what happened to the lights?
GID00075261	I still don't understand how my father escaped. Isn't the Vault door sealed?
GID00075262	Why would your father kill Jonas? That makes no sense.
GID00075264	So this is the Lincoln Memorial?
GID00075269	I have to be on my way.
GID00075270	I don't think you're in any condition to make threats.
GID00075271	Okay, okay. Sorry.
GID00075272	I don't cut anyone slack. Deal with it.
GID00075273	Whoa, whoa. Calm down! Who are you?
GID00075274	Get a grip, lady.
GID00075275	My apologies. I didn't know who you were.
GID00075276	Reilly's Rangers, huh? Never heard of you.
GID00075277	What happened to you and the rest of the Rangers?
GID00075280	Is this going to be a long story? 'Cause I've got things to do...
GID00075281	Hannibal says you need something?
GID00075282	Protect escaped slaves? You've got to be kidding. You're worth money to me!
GID00075283	Where the hell am I supposed to get a picture of the Memorial?
GID00075284	That's a noble cause, but can I ask you about something else?
GID00075285	I could get rid of the Super Mutants, if there are any.
GID00075286	What is that stone head?
GID00075287	I'll need to think about that.
GID00075288	Yeah... that's a problem. Well, I'd better get going.
GID00075289	What are a bunch of escaped slaves doing holed up here?
GID00075290	Sounds dangerous. Where is this place?
GID00075291	Why don't you let them stay here?
GID00075292	I'll bet you know where I can find one.
GID00075293	You're looking for the Declaration of Independence? Guess what I have...
GID00075294	Can you repair something for me?
GID00075295	Can you repair something for me?
GID00075299	You're in luck! I think I may already have what you're looking for.
GID00075300	I just thought you might be interested... It's an artifact.
GID00075301	You'd be the only one in the entire world to have this...
GID00075302	Some culture would be good for you, Ghoul.
GID00075303	Sure, 200 caps sounds good.
GID00075304	Actually, let me think about it.
GID00075305	Let's make it 300 caps and you have a deal.
GID00075306	How did you end up in the Brotherhood?
GID00075307	What was the Scourge?
GID00075308	Sounds like a nice place. You should go back.
GID00075309	I'm looking for runaway slaves.
GID00075310	How did you escape?
GID00075311	How did you end up back here?
GID00075312	That's pretty amazing, Kodiak.
GID00075313	Oh, you're done? Sorry, I nodded off there...
GID00075314	What happened to your parents?
GID00075315	What happened to the other kids from the Pitt?
GID00075316	That's awful! How could the Brotherhood do that?
GID00075317	What made them so terrible?
GID00075318	Huh? I'm sorry, are you still talking?
GID00075319	Yeah, I did. I'm sorry, go on...
GID00075320	That was before I knew how boring it was.
GID00075334	Who takes care of you?
GID00075336	Who else is around town?
GID00075338	What do you think about Gallows?
GID00075339	So, what's your real name?
GID00075340	What's the story with Gallows?
GID00075341	What's the pool up to?
GID00075342	No one knows his name?
GID00075343	What's with that Gallows guy?
GID00075344	What do you think of Knight Captain Gallows?
GID00075358	Sure am. Stopped in to find something to do.
GID00075359	I was wrong. I'm sorry. I do need your help.
GID00075360	I may have been a little hasty earlier. I'm ready to hear your plan.
GID00075361	Nothing. I just wanted to see if you were still waiting for me to come back.
GID00075362	Sorry, Amata. I do trust you. It's just a lot to take in.
GID00075363	Lights out? Radroaches? Maybe you'd better tell me more about what's going on.
GID00075364	Whatever. In any case, I don't need any more of your "help."
GID00075365	Not another one of your "plans," Amata...
GID00075366	I don't need help from anyone. Especially not from the Overseer's daughter.
GID00075367	Well, when you put it that way... maybe I could use your help.
GID00075368	Dad didn't need your help, and neither do I.
GID00075369	Wait... If the door to the exit is sealed, how am I supposed to get out?
GID00075370	Spill it, Amata. How do I get to the exit?
GID00075371	My Dad can't have really left the vault. That's impossible.
GID00075372	No, I had no idea he was planning to leave.
GID00075373	Of course he did! My dad tells me everything. <Lie.>
GID00075374	You're right. It's none of your business.
GID00075375	Secret tunnel... sounds promising. But how do I get into the Overseer's office?
GID00075376	So while I'm doing all this breaking and entering, you're helping me... how?
GID00075377	I just have to break into the most heavily guarded place in the Vault? That it?
GID00075387	There's no sign of him, but I'm sure he's alive.
GID00075388	All right, Lucy. Calm down. I'll find Ian.
GID00075389	Sorry. I agreed to go to Arefu. That's it.
GID00075390	If you want me to find Ian, I'll need to equip myself. That costs money.
GID00075391	You're right. I can't stay here. But where can I go?
GID00075392	I've heard enough. I'm going to make them pay.
GID00075394	You're the Overseer's daughter! Can't you fix this?
GID00075395	Even if that's all true... how did you get here first?
GID00075396	I need to escape the Vault. And you're going to help me.
GID00075397	Escape the Vault? How?
GID00075398	What can you tell me about the Brotherhood?
GID00075399	That's all for now.
GID00075400	Who are the enemies of the Brotherhood?
GID00075401	How did the Brotherhood start?
GID00075402	Who leads the Brotherhood?
GID00075403	Who are the members of the Brotherhood?
GID00075404	What is the purpose of the Brotherhood?
GID00075405	I have a few questions about the Citadel.
GID00075406	That's all I needed.
GID00075407	Can you describe the layout of the Citadel?
GID00075408	Do you have a medic?
GID00075409	I need some supplies. Who would I see about that?
GID00075410	What do you Scribes do?
GID00075411	That's all I needed.
GID00075412	What are the Orders?
GID00075413	What Order are you a part of?
GID00075414	What does the Brotherhood believe?
GID00075415	What does a Scribe do?
GID00075416	That's all I need to know.
GID00075417	Who are the members of the Brotherhood?
GID00075445	I've never seen you so scared, Amata. What's happened?
GID00075447	Tell me who killed Jonas. They won't get away with this!
GID00075448	Why didn't you say they were killing people? Let's get out of here!
GID00075449	I'm listening now. What's happened to Jonas?
GID00075451	Oh my God... Are you okay?
GID00075481	What's this building for?
GID00075490	I need to speak to Three Dog.
GID00075491	"Free voice of the people"? What does that mean?
GID00075492	What's the Brotherhood doing here?
GID00075516	I'm trying to convince Harkness he's an android, but he wants proof.
GID00075517	I'm not sure how to put this... You're not who you think you are.
GID00075518	This isn't an existential debate. You're a robot from the Commonwealth.
GID00075519	I don't suppose you know that you're a robot, do you?
GID00075520	I'm being completely serious. You're a robot from the Commonwealth.
GID00075521	We need to talk.
GID00075522	Those memories of your wife aren't real. You're a robot from the Commonwealth.
GID00075523	You're a robot from the Commonwealth. You belong to a man named Zimmer.
GID00075524	I can see you aren't going to believe me. Never mind. Forget I said anything.
GID00075527	Sometimes you have to kill the bad guys.
GID00075529	Don't worry, Harkness. Your secret is safe with me.
GID00075531	People will kill you when they find out. The Commonwealth is where you belong.
GID00075532	You're more than "just a machine." You're a person, Harkness. You belong here.
GID00075534	I know you don't believe me, but I'm telling the truth!
GID00075535	Threaten me all you want, but it won't change the truth!
GID00075538	Huh? What's wrong, Amata?
GID00075539	What do you mean, my Dad is "gone"?
GID00075540	How weird. I was just dreaming about you...
GID00075541	Leave me alone. I'm trying to get some sleep.
GID00075542	Hey, I didn't mean to upset you...
GID00075543	Ooh! That hurt! Do us all a favor and just run away from home.
GID00075544	This is your mess, kid. Get yourself out of it.
GID00075545	Sure, kid. Sorry I said those things. Let's get you home.
GID00075546	Your mother's a bitch and you're a spoiled little punk.
GID00075547	What are you so upset about?
GID00075548	I don't think so. I've got questions.
GID00075549	Have you seen C.J. Young lately?
GID00075550	I've met your mother. No wonder you're such a brat.
GID00075551	Calm down. I'm here to help.
GID00075552	Your gun is jammed? Can I take a look at it?
GID00075553	Yeah, it's jammed good. I can't help you.
GID00075554	No, I just wanted to look at it.
GID00075555	Don't worry about it. Just keep your head down and let's get out of here.
GID00075556	So, you're a representative of the mighty Brotherhood? Please.
GID00075557	What's happening here?
GID00075558	Is the initiate still alive?
GID00075559	What sort of exercise were you doing out here?
GID00075560	What's in it for me?
GID00075561	I've heard enough. Let's go get your man.
GID00075562	I can't help you.
GID00075563	I'm sorry, I can't help you.
GID00075564	Fuck off, boy scout. I'm not here to help you.
GID00075565	Here, just pull this back to clear the chamber.
GID00075566	Mock you? I'd rather kill you.
GID00075567	All right then, let's go.
GID00075585	Looks like you could use a weapon.
GID00075586	Hold on, short stuff. Who are you and what are you doing here?
GID00075587	What makes you think I'm here to rescue you?
GID00075588	Sorry, I'm not here to rescue you. In fact, I've got to get going.
GID00075589	Okay, I'll help you.
GID00075594	Not interested. I'm just here to do some shopping.
GID00075595	Okay, I guess I'll help with this "Survival Guide."
GID00075596	Hell no, crazy girl. I won't be your lab rat.
GID00075598	You'll find it much harder to practice medicine with two broken arms. Talk!
GID00075609	Let's just say it's in your best interest to tell me what I want to know.
GID00075610	Maybe 100 caps will jog your memory?
GID00075611	Sorry, I must have you confused with somebody else. Forget I mentioned it.
GID00075662	Nothing. Just wishing me a happy birthday.
GID00075681	Relax, Squire. I don't bite.
GID00075682	Understandable. I've met a lot of dangerous people myself.
GID00075683	Good. Your fear... pleases me.
GID00075684	There's no need to be nervous. You can trust me.
GID00075685	You should be nervous. Who says that I'm not here to kill you all?
GID00075686	The honor is all mine, Squire.
GID00075687	You seem nervous, kid. Do I make you nervous?
GID00075696	I'd like permission to trade.
GID00075697	You don't say much, do you?
GID00075698	<Say nothing.>
GID00075699	<Continue to say nothing.>
GID00075700	<Continue to say nothing.>
GID00075708	Come on, let's get out of here.
GID00075709	Red's fine. Let's go!
GID00075710	Nah, maybe another time.
GID00075711	Come on, don't charge me. It was an... accident. Won't happen again.
GID00075712	Sure, I'll buy another one. Here's 100 caps.
GID00075713	Tell me how this all happened.
GID00075714	Don't worry. I would never turn in a runaway slave.
GID00075715	Here's 25 caps. Maybe you can buy yourself a gun.
GID00075716	You're a runaway. I had to tell Sister about you.
GID00075717	So you're an escaped slave? Now I understand...
GID00075718	Let me think about it.
GID00075719	You're on your own. I'm not getting involved.
GID00075720	At ease, private. I'm here to inspect the armory.
GID00075721	So what's your story, slag heap?
GID00075722	But you're a man. Why do they call you Sister?
GID00075723	Hey, I don't want any trouble.
GID00075724	I'm just looking around.
GID00075725	What is all this crap, metal head?
GID00075726	Some kids are just born bad.
GID00075727	No, I haven't seen him.
GID00075728	What is this I hear about the Hangar Deck and Upper Deck?
GID00075729	Sure. Here's 5 caps. Go ahead and pick your poison.
GID00075730	Sorry. Not interested. Get your own drinks.
GID00075731	Are you from Rivet City? You don't act like the rest of them.
GID00075744	What are you? Some sort of bodyguard?
GID00075745	Easy, pal. I'm just minding my own business here.
GID00075746	No, sir. I'm just here to drink and talk.
GID00075747	That depends. What makes a troublemaker?
GID00075748	Whoa! I just wanted to ask you something.
GID00075749	So, you report to Chief Harkness?
GID00075750	There's a church in Rivet City?
GID00075751	If you're the acolyte, who's the priest?
GID00075752	I'm kind of lost. Can you help me?
GID00075753	Where can I get medical help?
GID00075754	Who's in charge around here?
GID00075755	Where are the stores?
GID00075756	You're a priest?
GID00075757	Me? Cause problems? Wouldn't dream of it. Your throat is safe with me.
GID00075758	And just how are you going to stop me?
GID00075759	So, where's your family?
GID00075760	You don't need to be scared, son.
GID00075761	Yes. I'm one of them. Have been for years. <lie>
GID00075762	I'm not going to hurt you. What are you so scared of?
GID00075763	You seem depressed.
GID00075764	Why wouldn't I remember you?
GID00075765	<Say nothing.>
GID00075766	You shouldn't take that stuff. It'll kill you.
GID00075767	Here. Have some Psycho.
GID00075768	Why don't you just take them from your shop?
GID00075770	Do you actually do anything here in Rivet City?
GID00075771	You seem pretty relaxed.
GID00075772	Did you know that Mei Wong is a runaway slave?
GID00075773	I think Mister Lopez is suicidal.
GID00075776	All right, here's your money.
GID00075777	Okay, fix me. Here's 100 caps.
GID00075778	Okay, fix me. Here's 100 caps.
GID00075779	Okay, fix me. Here's 100 caps.
GID00075780	Okay, fix me. Here's 100 caps.
GID00075781	Sorry, I don't have 100 caps.
GID00075782	Sorry, I don't have 100 caps.
GID00075783	Sorry, I don't have 100 caps.
GID00075784	Sorry, I don't have 100 caps.
GID00075785	Okay, fix me. Here's 100 caps.
GID00075786	Sorry, I don't have 100 caps.
GID00075787	Actually, I don't have 150 caps.
GID00075788	Here's your money.
GID00075789	Okay, fix me. Here's 75 caps.
GID00075790	Okay, fix me. Here's 75 caps.
GID00075791	Sorry, I don't have 75 caps.
GID00075792	Sorry, I don't have 75 caps.
GID00075793	Okay, fix me. Here's 75 caps.
GID00075794	Sorry, I don't have 75 caps.
GID00075795	Okay, fix me. Here's 75 caps.
GID00075796	Sorry, I don't have 100 caps.
GID00075797	Okay, fix me. Here's 75 caps.
GID00075798	Sorry, I don't have 100 caps.
GID00075799	Actually, I don't have 100 caps.
GID00075800	That's all I need.
GID00075801	There was something else I needed...
GID00075805	This is ridiculous. Forget it.
GID00075806	Okay, let's just take a step back. 100 caps was reasonable, wasn't it?
GID00075807	Fine, 300 caps. Now spill it.
GID00075808	I don't have 300 caps.
GID00075809	If I find anything, you'll be the first to know.
GID00075810	Sure, sure. Just keep making with the loot.
GID00075811	Well, I'm off.
GID00075813	What are you up to?
GID00075821	300? What the hell? You said it was 100 caps!
GID00075822	I'm sorry, but we had a deal for 100 caps.
GID00075824	So, you really care about these relics?
GID00075825	I suppose I see your point.
GID00075826	Looks like a bunch of junk to me.
GID00075827	I wish I knew more about America.
GID00075828	Whatever, old timer.
GID00075829	This place is a dump.
GID00075830	I found it quite entertaining.
GID00075831	Well, I've looked around a bit.
GID00075832	Liberty Bell
GID00075835	Statue of Liberty Torch
GID00075842	Fort McHenry Cannon
GID00075845	Part of Original Stars & Stripes
GID00075849	I heard that Rivet City is run by some sort of Council?
GID00075850	What is the Capital Preservation Society?
GID00075851	I heard Angela Staley has a crush on Diego.
GID00075853	Who is this Saint Monica?
GID00075854	I need to leave. Can you open the gate?
GID00075866	Sounds rough.
GID00075867	What else are women good for, anyway?
GID00075868	He seems harmless.
GID00075869	That old man's out of his mind.
GID00075870	Since we're partners now, why don't you tell me about yourself?
GID00075871	He keeps paying me all
GID00075872	I'm an agent of Thomas Jefferson and I've returned to liberate the Declaration.
GID00075873	You recovered all of that stuff in the Preservation Society's museum?
GID00075877	Let me prove my honesty by helping you trick the Redcoats.
GID00075878	How can we create a convincing forgery?
GID00075879	I'll try and get the ink for you.
GID00075880	Let me think about that option.
GID00075881	It will be carried to our new President, Abraham Washington.
GID00075882	It will be brought to the State House for safe keeping.
GID00075883	Yes, Button. We won!
GID00075884	Sure, whatever.
GID00075885	Stand down, and honorably relinquish your post. You've earned a rest.
GID00075886	I have the Declaration of Independence.
GID00075887	Here, take one of these Stimpaks. It should help.
GID00075888	I'm sorry, I'm out of meds. Hang in there.
GID00075889	Here, take one of these Stimpaks. It should help.
GID00075895	I'll just be going now.
GID00075915	Whoa, hold on there. I'm a friend.
GID00075916	You're kidding me, right?
GID00075926	He's needed at home. His family is dead.
GID00075927	He doesn't belong here.
GID00075928	I'm going to kick your ass all over this Metro station if you don't help me!
GID00075929	You really have a bad attitude.
GID00075930	Can't you just help out without being so mean?
GID00075931	Just exploring, sorry.
GID00075932	I'm not telling you jack. Now let me get by!
GID00075933	I really need to get by you. It's important I find what I'm looking for.
GID00075934	Hang on a second. I have a letter for Ian West from his sister.
GID00075935	I'd like to buy something.
GID00075936	Can you repair my gear?
GID00075937	So what's your story?
GID00075938	You mean you were the best shot. I'm here now.
GID00075939	That's impressive. Competition must be stiff around here.
GID00075940	Dusk? Oh, let me guess! Your real name's Dawn. Or is it Twilight?
GID00075941	Please. Like I'm afraid of you people.
GID00075942	Sorry, I was just joking around.
GID00075943	Good to know.
GID00075946	I could be his friend.
GID00075947	He really shouldn't be here.
GID00075948	Reilly? Who's that? Never heard of her.
GID00075949	I don't know any Reilly, but I do know we need to get the hell off this roof.
GID00075950	I don't know a Reilly, and I'm out of here.
GID00075951	Yeah, let's do it.
GID00075952	I'd like to help, but nothing's free.
GID00075953	Screw this. I'm out of here.
GID00075955	So where's the key?
GID00075956	Why haven't you robbed him?
GID00075957	Sounds risky. What if he catches me?
GID00075958	Thanks for the info, Jericho.
GID00075959	Funny. I'll take my caps back now.
GID00075960	You're an asshole, Jericho.
GID00075961	It's okay, Leo. I want to help.
GID00075962	You're hurting your family, Leo. Jenny and Andy care about you.
GID00075963	That would be a good idea.
GID00075964	You've made the right choice, Leo.
GID00075965	I could tell them for you.
GID00075966	I never thought about it that way. Can you hook me up?
GID00075967	What's it worth to you to keep it out of the public eye?
GID00075968	Never mind, Leo. It's not my business, anyway.
GID00075969	Maybe I could take a look at it.
GID00075970	That's too bad.
GID00075983	Wow, are you batshit insane or what?
GID00075984	Um... okay... You do know there was a war 200 years ago, right?
GID00075985	Calm down, pal, before I put a hole in your chest.
GID00075986	Whoa, whoa, whoa.... Take it easy.
GID00075987	Why are you being so hostile?
GID00075988	What the hell is your problem?
GID00075989	Can you give me some information about Arefu?
GID00075991	Whatever. A shotgun would have been nice.
GID00075992	This should buy you something. <Give 10 caps.>
GID00075993	Go for the top shelf. On me. <Give 20 caps.>
GID00075994	I don't think so.
GID00075997	What if all your other neighbors agree?
GID00075998	Whatever.
GID00075999	This is happening. You're going to have to deal with it, or get forced out.
GID00076000	I don't care. Get your stuff together and get out of here.
GID00076001	I'm sure you'll find something suitable, don't worry.
GID00076002	Good luck.
GID00076003	What would it take to convince you to let Ghouls live here?
GID00076007	Sure, sounds good. I would have done it for free.
GID00076008	I'll take it. And any other help you can offer.
GID00076009	You want this problem resolved or not? You can spare more than that...
GID00076010	Perhaps the residents could be "persuaded" to let the Ghouls live here.
GID00076011	I was just kidding. Ghouls are filthy creatures that should be slaughtered.
GID00076012	That can be arranged. You don't look like much.
GID00076013	We'll see.
GID00076014	Have you even tried talking to the Ghouls? I bet you can work something out.
GID00076015	Yeah, Ghouls are too much trouble.
GID00076016	You're all bigots.
GID00076017	Whatever. It's not really any of my business.
GID00076018	Lend me some men to take into the tunnels to hunt Ghouls.
GID00076019	You can spare a few men, at least, can't you?
GID00076020	You're right. Never mind.
GID00076021	Half the force is napping. Give them some stims, and we'll go kick some ass!
GID00076024	Would you tell Mister Tenpenny that you wouldn't mind Ghoul neighbors?
GID00076026	Thank you, it's quite an honor. Now, for my reward?
GID00076027	Okay pops, just hand over the reward and you can get back to your history books.
GID00076029	I have the Declaration of Independence.
GID00076039	Intercom1-1
GID00076040	Intercom1-2
GID00076041	Intercom1-3
GID00076042	Intercom2-1
GID00076043	Intercom2-2
GID00076044	Intercom3-1
GID00076045	Intercom3-2
GID00076046	Intercom4-1
GID00076047	Intercom4-2
GID00076048	You crazy machine, just give me the Declaration!
GID00076049	What are you talking about? You're a robot!
GID00076050	Get out of my way you lunatic!
GID00076051	Why would you do all that over a scrap of paper?
GID00076052	You do realize that it's about 500 years later, don't you?
GID00076053	Ummm, allow me to ponder my decision.
GID00076054	There's more to this than you realize, Button.
GID00076055	Are you hurt?
GID00076065	Okay, now I've seen everything...
GID00076066	You're a poet, right? Do you have a name?
GID00076067	<Say nothing.>
GID00076078	I might be able to get you in there.
GID00076079	Right on. Kill those elitists. I think I can help you with that escape door.
GID00076080	This is going to be fun!
GID00076081	Well, maybe I should talk to Tenpenny. There may be a peaceful solution.
GID00076082	Let me try talking to Tenpenny. Maybe he wouldn't mind you living there.
GID00076083	It's not really any of my business. Sorry I asked.
GID00076084	It's Tenpenny's tower. He can do whatever he wants.
GID00076085	Whatever. You're no better than Tenpenny.
GID00076086	Whatever. I'm leaving.
GID00076087	Good luck with that. I'll have none of it.
GID00076088	You're a zombie! People should shoot you!
GID00076089	I'll get that door open, and then you can let your hordes in.
GID00076091	I can get them to let you move in / You can now move in.
GID00076096	So what are you, the guard dog?
GID00076100	Here? We can't shoot a gun here.
GID00076101	What do I get to kill?
GID00076102	I'm out of BBs.
GID00076103	Nothing's wrong, Dad.
GID00076104	What's a Radroach?
GID00076105	How do I kill it?
GID00076106	I can do it!
GID00076107	I can't do it!
GID00076108	What kind of surprise?
GID00076109	I don't like surprises.
GID00076110	This is so great! Thanks!
GID00076111	Thanks, Dad.
GID00076153	Who are you?
GID00076167	Are they Raiders or Slavers?
GID00076168	I'm sorry, Agatha. I couldn't find the violin in Vault 92. <Lie.>
GID00076169	I'm afraid I don't have the Stradivarius yet.
GID00076170	Sorry, Agatha. I sold the Stradivarius to the highest bidder.
GID00076171	Here's your violin, Agatha.
GID00076172	What do your parents do?
GID00076173	What do you do around here?
GID00076177	Where is Doctor Li's lab?
GID00076178	I'm only trying to help, Doc.
GID00076179	I'm only trying to help, Doc. <Lie.>
GID00076180	You can trust me. I'm a doctor myself.
GID00076181	Never mind, then.
GID00076191	What's got you so spooked?
GID00076192	What are you, some kind of a wimp?
GID00076198	I think we got off on the wrong foot...
GID00076199	I've had enough of your shit, Dusk.
GID00076200	Yeah, whatever.
GID00076209	I had some questions about the Citadel.
GID00076210	Who's in charge here?
GID00076211	What do you do here?
GID00076212	That's all I needed.
GID00076213	What do you believe?
GID00076214	Why do you worship the bomb?
GID00076215	What the hell is wrong with you people?
GID00076216	<Donate 10 caps.>
GID00076217	<Donate 100 caps.>
GID00076218	<Donate 50 caps.>
GID00076219	I've changed my mind.
GID00076240	Do you know a way I can earn some money around here?
GID00076241	I think I have an idea what you might mean. Go on.
GID00076242	I'll do it.
GID00076243	What's in it for me?
GID00076244	Ghosts? What are you talking about?
GID00076245	I don't think I can help you.
GID00076247	Who's in charge around here?
GID00076265	You're a bitch to find.
GID00076266	Look, Ian. I know loss, too. I know it hurts. But staying here isn't the answer.
GID00076267	I give up. Fine, stay here and cry.
GID00076268	I found him. He's safe.
GID00076269	I haven't found him. <Lie.>
GID00076270	I found him. He's with the Family.
GID00076272	You're nuts to live here. That thing will blow you all to Hell.
GID00076273	I don't need a reward. I couldn't sleep at night knowing you could all die.
GID00076274	100 caps? All right, I'll take a look at it.
GID00076275	Not my problem. Good luck, Sheriff.
GID00076276	Demolition expertise doesn't come cheap. I want 500 caps.
GID00076278	So which do you like more, being mayor or being sheriff?
GID00076285	Whatever, grandma. Like I care.
GID00076286	I'm sorry, the heat must be getting to me. My apologies.
GID00076287	That's funny, I was about to ask you the same thing.
GID00076288	Exploring.
GID00076289	I prefer to keep my business to myself. And I suggest you do the same.
GID00076291	I take it you don't get many visitors, then.
GID00076292	Surely you haven't severed all contacts?
GID00076293	What could you possibly have to trade?
GID00076294	That sounds risky. What if the caravan never arrives?
GID00076295	Is there any way I can help?
GID00076296	Let's cut to the chase. Is there something you need?
GID00076297	Your husband's radio can broadcast across the entire Capital Wasteland?
GID00076298	You built a homemade violin, huh? Impressive.
GID00076299	Sorry to interrupt, but where can I find the violin?
GID00076300	More stories? Ugh...
GID00076301	A violin? That's hardly something that would have survived the war.
GID00076302	I'm interested, but what will you give me in return?
GID00076303	All right. I give you my word I'll do my best to recover a violin for you.
GID00076304	I need some time to think about it.
GID00076308	Tell me a bit about your great-great-grandmother.
GID00076309	What do you know about the Soil Stradivarius?
GID00076310	How will I know the Stradivarius when I see it?
GID00076311	Is the Stradivarius worth a ton of caps?
GID00076313	Can you tell me anything about Vault-Tec Headquarters?
GID00076314	You eat people's brains, right? So what's it like being a zombie?
GID00076315	I didn't mean to offend. I'm not prejudiced.
GID00076316	You're the prejudiced asshole, not me. So you're ugly. Big deal.
GID00076317	No, really. I mean it. I don't care if you're a Ghoul or not.
GID00076318	Whatever.
GID00076319	Ah... Nevermind.
GID00076323	I... uh... only drink for medicinal reasons.
GID00076324	I'm actually just looking for some food.
GID00076325	Can you help me find something else?
GID00076326	I've been looking for you.
GID00076327	What's it like living at Tenpenny Tower?
GID00076328	Yes, it's an interesting collection indeed.
GID00076329	It's an interesting collection of garbage.
GID00076330	All right, I'll bite. Which document is missing?
GID00076331	Who cares...
GID00076332	Maybe later. I've got better things to do right now.
GID00076333	Let me take a leap of faith here... you want me to find it for you.
GID00076334	Skip the history lesson, professor.
GID00076335	Um... no. I've still got more important things to do.
GID00076336	I have to go now.
GID00076337	Not now. Maybe another time.
GID00076338	I'd love to be a part of history, and bring you the Declaration.
GID00076339	What does the Declaration of Independence look like?
GID00076340	Can you show me how to get to the National Archives on my map?
GID00076342	Do I look like someone that you want to blow off?
GID00076343	I'm sorry to interrupt, Andy. I just had a few questions.
GID00076349	Yeah, what's my reward for all this legwork?
GID00076350	I suppose that's good enough for me.
GID00076351	Can the speech, Abe. I need to get paid.
GID00076352	Can we stop beating around the bush, please? What's the reward?
GID00076354	Thanks, you're not so bad yourself.
GID00076355	Yep. I sure am.
GID00076356	What do you mean "fellow relic hunter"?
GID00076357	I don't work with strangers.
GID00076358	What are you proposing?
GID00076359	Nope, not interested.
GID00076360	Whoa, whoa. Slow down. Let me think a minute.
GID00076361	Sure, let's team up.
GID00076362	Let's go.
GID00076363	Wait here a minute.
GID00076364	I know it's painful, but let's talk about what happened in Arefu.
GID00076381	I'll need some details before I can decide.
GID00076382	Tunnel Snakes? You guys are some kind of gang, is that it?
GID00076385	I'll see if I can talk some sense into them.
GID00076386	You have to fight your own battles. I can't help you with everything...
GID00076387	Look, Amata, this is none of my business. I don't want to get involved...
GID00076391	Maybe I can help. She's very sensitive about her weight...
GID00076393	What's going on here?
GID00076394	Looks like you're having fun.
GID00076395	Hey, it's none of my business.
GID00076396	If you say so, Dad.
GID00076397	But, I'm sick. Really. <Lie.>
GID00076398	Anything I need to know about the G.O.A.T.?
GID00076399	Do we have to die in the Vault? Can't we ever leave?
GID00076400	Is it true, Dad? Was everyone born in the Vault?
GID00076401	Can we talk about, you know... mom?
GID00076402	Why do you listen to Butch?
GID00076404	If you say so.
GID00076405	I've heard you do anything he tells you. And I mean anything.
GID00076407	Oh, I get it! Butch is the leader. You're just... a follower.
GID00076427	Sure. Do it.
GID00076428	Nah. Maybe later.
GID00076429	Command protocol delta-five-three. Disengage security program.
GID00076430	Yes. Please end this quest.
GID00076431	No, brother. Perhaps another time.
GID00076432	I can't decide now.
GID00076433	What do you think of the other people in Andale?
GID00076434	What's going on around Andale?
GID00076435	Do you like living in Andale?
GID00076436	What's going to happen to the kids?
GID00076437	Now what will you do?
GID00076438	So, you grew up here too?
GID00076450	Yeah. I'm sorry, Sierra. Here's a Nuka-Cola Quantum for you!
GID00076451	Here, maybe this will shut you up. <Give a Nuka-Cola Quantum.>
GID00076452	I don't know, maybe.
GID00076453	I think I'd rather be smacked in the head with a blunt instrument.
GID00076454	I think I've had just about enough of this.
GID00076456	Look, lady. I just want to get out of this nuthouse...
GID00076457	Yeah, I guess you're right. It isn't that bad.
GID00076458	Let me think about this, Sierra.
GID00076459	Glowing pee? That sounds like dangerous stuff!
GID00076460	No way! I'm not scouring the Wasteland for some stupid soft drink!
GID00076461	Invalid choice list coming up.
GID00076476	I'm sorry, Ian, but your parents are dead.
GID00076477	If Lucy is still alive I bet she misses you.
GID00076478	Initiate triage protocol.
GID00076479	Yes.
GID00076480	No. I'm done with you.
GID00076481	This may sound odd, but is there a trainyard outside Arefu?
GID00076482	The Wests had bite marks on their necks. Mean anything to you?
GID00076493	Okay, I believe you. I was just curious about it.
GID00076494	If you don't stop seeing her, I'll tell Father Clifford about it.
GID00076495	It's just a rumor. I'd ask Diego about it first.
GID00076496	I saw them myself, on the light deck. Under the stars... <Lie.>
GID00076497	Suicide is a sin. Kill yourself, and your soul won't go to Heaven.
GID00076498	Couldn't save your family, can't kill yourself... You're fucking pathetic.
GID00076499	If that's what you really want, I'll help you.
GID00076500	What about Ted? He needs guidance. A father figure.
GID00076501	Real courage is living. Only cowards commit suicide.
GID00076502	Tell me about Allistair Tenpenny.
GID00076503	I think I've broken something.
GID00076504	Just heal me, doc.
GID00076505	I need a new face, doc.
GID00076506	You know, I'm not as bad off as I thought.
GID00076507	What can you tell me about Tenpenny Tower?
GID00076508	I'd like to do business with you.
GID00076509	Why don't you fight back?
GID00076510	Mister Burke, is it? Please, continue. I find myself... enthralled.
GID00076511	It does?
GID00076512	It does?
GID00076513	Let's talk about something else.
GID00076514	Messing with that bomb seems pretty technical. What if I can't do it?
GID00076515	Throw in an extra 500 caps, and you've got yourself a deal.
GID00076516	Megaton is under my protection. You're going to leave... now.
GID00076517	All right, Mister Burke. I'll do it. Megaton will burn.
GID00076518	Actually, the sheriff will pay me to disarm the bomb.
GID00076519	You're out of your mind, Burke. There's no way I'm helping you.
GID00076520	Actually, I may have reconsidered. Let's discuss my role in this again.
GID00076521	I've disarmed the bomb, Burke. That thing will never explode now.
GID00076522	Go on. I'm listening.
GID00076523	Wait... You're going to destroy the town?
GID00076524	You're a sick man, Burke. This conversation's over.
GID00076525	If I destroy Megaton, I'll lose access to all of the town's services...
GID00076526	What's so special about this Tenpenny Tower?
GID00076527	We're talking a lot of innocent lives here, Burke. Can I warn them?
GID00076528	If you've got a point, make it.
GID00076529	Goodbye.
GID00076530	Let's discuss this bomb.
GID00076535	I need to talk to you.
GID00076536	Sorry. Go back to sleep.
GID00076537	Scream all you want. It won't help.
GID00076539	Sure, why not.
GID00076540	Nope, sorry.
GID00076541	A job usually means I get paid.
GID00076542	Where is Arefu?
GID00076543	Do you suspect your family is in danger?
GID00076548	What's the word around town? Heard anything interesting?
GID00076553	I can help take care of that little Ghoul problem for you.
GID00076554	I've killed so many Ghouls, I've stopped counting.
GID00076555	I kill Ghouls and rent-a-cops with attitudes who ask too many questions.
GID00076556	You going to let me in or not?
GID00076557	I just want to look around a little. Come on. I won't hurt anybody.
GID00076558	That's where you're mistaken. Does 100 caps sound about right?
GID00076559	Come on, let me in. Just for a little while. I won't cause any trouble.
GID00076560	Open the damn gate! I'm done being interrogated by you!
GID00076561	Is that how you treat all your guests?
GID00076562	Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?
GID00076563	I don't think you're talking to the person you think you are.
GID00076564	I'm here to see Tenpenny.
GID00076565	I have a lucrative offer for Tenpenny. Let me in, or you'll come to regret it.
GID00076566	Tenpenny is expecting me. I'm a new tenant. <Lie.>
GID00076567	Just let me in already!
GID00076571	Just show me your stuff.
GID00076572	Paulie's dead. He has been for a while.
GID00076573	You're too chicken to run away.
GID00076574	Nope.
GID00076575	Sure. I'll help.
GID00076584	Let's talk about my father.
GID00076585	I don't have 100 caps.
GID00076586	All right, Moriarty. Here's 100 caps. Now where's my father?
GID00076587	No thanks. I'll find out on my own.
GID00076588	Who did you think I was?
GID00076589	I'd be glad to help. What do you need?
GID00076591	I met a man named Burke. He said he'd pay me to rig the bomb to explode.
GID00076592	I need to buy some Chems.
GID00076593	The bomb can't be disarmed, Simms. In fact, I plan to detonate it.
GID00076594	Show me what you've got.
GID00076595	I need you to repair some equipment.
GID00076596	Cut the bullshit, Moriarty. I want the truth. How can you possibly know me?
GID00076597	Huh? My father and I were born in Vault 101...
GID00076598	You're lying. The Vault's been sealed for 200 years!
GID00076599	Tell me what you know! Tell me everything!
GID00076600	Look, I just want to find my Dad. Do you know where he is?
GID00076601	Let's cut to the chase. How much for you to tell me where my father is?
GID00076602	Tell me where he is, Moriarty, or I'll beat it out of you!
GID00076603	It does?
GID00076604	If you've got a point, make it.
GID00076605	And how do you propose I do that?
GID00076606	Wait... You want me to help you destroy the town?
GID00076607	You're a sick man, Burke. This conversation's over.
GID00076608	Throw in a 300 cap bonus, and you've got yourself a deal
GID00076609	Megaton is under my protection. You're going to leave, now, and never come back. Understood?
GID00076610	All right, Mister Burke. I'll do it. Megaton will burn.
GID00076611	Actually, the sheriff will pay me to disarm the bomb...
GID00076612	You're out of your mind, Burke. There's no way I'm helping you.
GID00076613	If I destroy Megaton, I'll lose access to all of the town's services....
GID00076614	What's so special about this Tenpenny Tower?
GID00076615	Messing with that bomb seems pretty... technical. What if I can't do it?
GID00076616	We're talking a lot of innocent lives here, Burke. Couldn't we at least warn them?
GID00076617	I've disarmed the bomb, Mister Burke. That thing will never explode, now.
GID00076618	It's time for me to go.
GID00076619	I'm just passing through.
GID00076620	What kind of trouble?
GID00076621	I have to go now.
GID00076622	None of your business.
GID00076623	Can you tell me more about what's been going on around here?
GID00076624	Tell me about the Family.
GID00076625	I could do it, Lucas. I could disarm the bomb.
GID00076626	Yeah... Yeah, good luck with that.
GID00076627	I could disarm that bomb for you, Simms. But it'd cost you.
GID00076628	Don't you have the password?
GID00076629	And you're supposed to be the smart one?
GID00076631	Never mind.
GID00076634	You seem like a good man, Lucas. I apologize if we started off on the wrong foot.
GID00076635	I could use some directions around town.
GID00076636	Is there a bar in town?
GID00076637	Where's the closest clinic?
GID00076638	I need some equipment. Where's the nearest general store?
GID00076639	Let's talk about something else.
GID00076640	Is there a weapons dealer around here?
GID00076641	Nice town you got here, sheriff. It's a pleasure to meet you.
GID00076642	Pffft. Nice hat, Calamity Jane.
GID00076643	<Say nothing.>
GID00076646	On second thought, never mind.
GID00076647	Yeah, I'm sure.
GID00076648	Thanks.
GID00076649	That's the only way?
GID00076650	Can you turn the computer back on?
GID00076654	What? No... No, that's impossible. He would never... Would he?
GID00076655	Liar! He... he would never betray me like that!
GID00076656	You were talking... to the Enclave?! About what?!
GID00076657	Okay, so you were talking to the Enclave. What did they want.
GID00076658	So you know the way to get there?
GID00076659	Monsters? What monsters?
GID00076672	Come on. I'm not so bad. There's more you want to tell me, isn't there?
GID00076673	Never mind then.
GID00076719	What's the word? Heard anything interesting?
GID00076720	SPELL HELP
GID00076721	Idle Chatter
GID00076722	Are you always here?
GID00076723	Are you always here?
GID00076724	Are you always here?
GID00076725	Are you always here?
GID00076726	[Attack] I'll make sure you don't live to tell him.
GID00076727	I have a dog tag for you.
GID00076728	If the area is filled with radiation, why are you still here?
GID00076729	Where should I go instead?
GID00076730	Can I ask you about Private Edwards?
GID00076732	I need to be going.
GID00076733	I need to be going.
GID00076734	I need to be going.
GID00076735	I need to be going.
GID00076736	Let me get back to you.
GID00076739	What's the quickest way out of this dump?
GID00076740	Come with me. There's something you should see, in front of the dinosaur.
GID00076741	I'd better go before I get a headache.
GID00076742	I don't think I need to hear any more.
GID00076743	I've heard enough for now.
GID00076744	Can you repair something for me?
GID00076745	I could use some stims.
GID00076746	Can I get some supplies?
GID00076747	I could use some ammo.
GID00076748	Goodbye.
GID00076749	Goodbye.
GID00076750	Goodbye.
GID00076751	Goodbye.
GID00076752	Tell me more about the Followers of the Apocalypse.
GID00076753	Who are Flowers of Pock-lips?
GID00076754	Where are the Followers based around here?
GID00076755	Where Flowers of Pock-lips live?
GID00076756	Do the Followers work together with the NCR?
GID00076757	Do Flowers and NCR Bear play together?
GID00076758	Goodbye.
GID00076759	I have to go now.
GID00076760	You don't look like you belong here. What's your story?
GID00076761	Let's talk about something else.
GID00076764	I need to you repair my weapons.
GID00076765	Let's talk about something else.
GID00076766	The Mole Rat repellent needs a recharge.
GID00076770	Goodbye.
GID00076771	I'm busy right now.
GID00076773	Who built Liberty Prime? Or better yet... why?
GID00076774	What do you make of the Enclave, Squire?
GID00076775	I'm not a tourist...
GID00076778	What strange things have happened?
GID00076779	What can you tell me about the ghouls spotted to the west?
GID00076780	Let me ask you something else.
GID00076784	Could I ask you about Rivet City's history?
GID00076786	What can you tell me about Underworld?
GID00076787	Tell me about the Church of Atom.
GID00076788	I'd like to donate to the Church.
GID00076790	You said something about schematics?
GID00076792	Do you sell any specialty items?
GID00076793	All right, fix me.
GID00076794	On second thought, I'll be fine.
GID00076795	Goodbye.
GID00076797	I don't suppose you know anything about the Super Mutants?
GID00076800	If you're the new doctor, can you heal me?
GID00076801	Let me see what you have for sale.
GID00076802	Your Republic is forfeit. Prepare to be reclaimed by the Wasteland!
GID00076803	Do you have any traders in town? Any doctors?
GID00076804	What can you tell me about Bigtown?
GID00076805	This place looks like a ghost town.
GID00076806	Where did you people come from, anyway?
GID00076808	All right, fix me.
GID00076809	Okay, fix me. Here's 50 caps.
GID00076810	Okay, fix me. Here's 50 caps.
GID00076811	Sorry, I don't have 50 caps.
GID00076812	Sorry, I don't have 50 caps.
GID00076813	Okay, fix me. Here's 50 caps.

GID00076815	Okay, fix me. Here's 50 caps.
GID00076816	Sorry, I don't have 100 caps.
GID00076817	Okay, fix me. Here's 50 caps.
GID00076818	Sorry, I don't have 100 caps.
GID00076819	Actually, I don't have 75 caps.
GID00076820	On second thought, I'll be fine.
GID00076822	Can I see what's on the menu?
GID00076823	You ever get outside, Cerberus? Into the Wasteland?
GID00076824	I need to buy medical supplies.
GID00076825	I need a drink.
GID00076826	What's on the menu?
GID00076827	Hey Leo, can you hook me up?
GID00076828	Let me see what you have for sale.
GID00076829	I want to buy a drink.
GID00076830	Know anything about the area outside Megaton?
GID00076831	Can you repair my equipment?
GID00076833	Goodbye.
GID00076834	All done.
GID00076835	Let's trade equipment.
GID00076836	<Storage::Open>
GID00076837	Tell me about Andale.
GID00076838	Let me ask you something else.
GID00076840	Goodbye.
GID00076841	They don't actually... make you fight. Do they?
GID00076842	Let's talk about something else.
GID00076843	I am not calling you "Mister President" every time I speak!
GID00076844	What can you tell me about Underworld?
GID00076846	Thanks for your time, Cerberus.
GID00076847	Do you sell any specialty items?
GID00076848	It's time for us to part ways.
GID00076849	You're fired, RL-3. Leave immediately.
GID00076850	I think we should part ways for now, Boone.
GID00076851	Raul, I think I need to head on without you.
GID00076852	<Companion Protocol::Terminate>
GID00076853	Can you tell me about the followers?
GID00076854	Why do you keep calling them Gangsters? I thought they were called Powder Gangers.
GID00076855	Want to play a hand of Caravan?
GID00076858	I'm all done playing for now.
GID00076859	Yeah, let's play again.
GID00076860	Goodbye.
GID00076861	What do you do for fun around here?
GID00076862	Can you give me directions?
GID00076865	What do you do around here?
GID00076867	What's the word around town?
GID00076868	PC says goodbye
GID00076870	That's all I needed to know.
GID00076871	I need to get going.
GID00076872	Goodbye.
GID00076873	Goodbye.

GID00076896	Nothing else right now.
GID00076897	Goodbye.
GID00076898	Understood.
GID00076899	I need to get going.
GID00076900	I'll be on my way.
GID00076901	Goodbye, Jason.
