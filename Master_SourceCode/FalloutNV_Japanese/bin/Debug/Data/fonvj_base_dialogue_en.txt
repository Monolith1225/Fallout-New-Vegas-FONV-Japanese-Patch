GID00001017	You have quite the menagerie at your disposal. If you can get the posse down to "small gang" size, I'll happily go with you.
GID00001018	As the old saying goes, two's company, but three's a small army. Okay, I'm paraphrasing a bit, but you get the idea.
GID00001019	A courier, a doctor, and cybernetic dog. After we deal with this whole "imminent conquest of New Vegas" problem we should open an act at the Tops.
GID00001020	There's something about that robot that doesn't seem... all right to me. I'm not saying we shouldn't take it with us.
GID00001021	I'm just saying that if it were to fall into Lake Mead and be irreparably damaged... and if you threw an EMP grenade in after it...
GID00001022	Well, there are worse things happening in the world, right?
GID00001023	After spending thirty years of my life hiding my association with the Enclave, I'd love to stroll the wasteland with a twitchy Eyebot.
GID00001024	Thanks for asking. I appreciate it. I do.
GID00001025	Back in your good graces again? I knew you'd see the light.
GID00001026	I don't think you need to worry about the specifics. Basically, expect a lot of firepower and dead bodies.
GID00001027	Enclave technology is even more advanced than Brotherhood equipment, and in the hands of soldiers as experienced as Moreno and the others...
GID00001028	Let's just say it's truly a sight to behold.
GID00001029	You'll need someone to watch your back - Craig Boone, an NCR sniper, will be joining you. Keep your head down out there!
GID00001030	A pity. I guess I'll have to find some other way to acquire her caravan's assets. Thanks for letting me know.
GID00001031	Told you everything about us, did he? Well, it's been a while since I've had my hands on the controls of a vertibird.
GID00001032	There's a chance I could crash us in the middle of Lake Mead - that place seems to attract aircraft, for some reason.
GID00001033	But, if I'll get one more chance to fly, count me in. I'll be there. My part of the pass phrase is "Dear."
GID00001034	Been awhile, Arcade. So, what's the point of all this? Can't find any younger mercenaries?
GID00001035	Arcade, huh? Heard he was with the Followers of the Apocalypse. So, what's the point of all this? Can't find any younger mercenaries?
GID00001036	Corporal White? I don't know where he - uh, I mean, never heard of him. Uh, I gotta go...
GID00001037	I expect results sooner rather than later.
GID00001038	They'll be of no use to the Legion, then.
GID00001039	You squandered a potentially valuable resource. Do better with your next assignment or there will be trouble...
GID00001040	Good. It will be valuable to have allies on the Strip when Hoover Dam is taken. Now, as for your next assignment...
GID00001041	You've been resourceful in the past. Why are you a failure now?
GID00001042	You'd best step up your performance with this next assignment...
GID00001043	Then get to it.
GID00001044	A perfectly satisfactory way of resolving the threat they posed. It's impressive that you made it through their barrage.
GID00001045	Now, as for your next assignment...
GID00001046	Good. Make sure they help the Legion when the time comes. As for your next assignment...
GID00001047	Yeah, all right. If McLafferty complains long enough, my folks might haul me back to California just to shut her up. Tell the old hag I'm gone.
GID00001048	Simple enough to change. I doubt the Legion's listening in on us - they're not that sophisticated - but better safe than sorry, right?
GID00001049	Very well. You can tell Reyes that this station is secure.
GID00001050	What, again? Didn't I just change those damn things? All right, fine - show me the new codes.
GID00001051	Oh. Uh... well, yeah, I can do that. Um, thanks.
GID00001052	You must be mistaken - I haven't filed any report like that. Trained deathclaws? I would have remembered that.
GID00001053	If someone is saying I filed that report, that's a load of crap. I won't have my name attached to a clerical error.
GID00001054	Good. I'm sure you were thorough. Here's your payment for a job well done.
GID00001055	Shit. Is he serious? The 25% increase in weapons is doable, but a 50% increase in ammunition is nuts.
GID00001056	We just don't have the supplies on hand to meet that kind of demand for new weapons.
GID00001057	Well, you've proven yourself reliable so far. Would you be interested in more important jobs?
GID00001058	Yes, I'd heard something about his untimely death. There will be a lot of questions from his family, so I trust you had nothing to do with this.
GID00001059	I guess the one bright spot is that I can strike his name from the payroll after all.
GID00001060	Yes, but at significant cost. I understand that you not only agreed that the company pay off his gambling debts, but he also gets severance.
GID00001061	I'm disappointed with this outcome, but what's done is done. At least we're rid of Henry.
GID00001062	Yes, I understand that he's decided to quit outright and not even ask for compensation. I'm a bit curious what exactly you said to him.
GID00001063	Then again, perhaps I'd rather not know. Thank you all the same - I'm very happy to be rid of that man.
GID00001064	Yes, I heard. I believe we're now responsible for paying off his gambling debts, but that you bargained him down from a more outrageous demand.
GID00001065	Well done. I'm very pleased to be rid of that man.
GID00001066	Very good. On occasion it's proven to be more profitable in the long run to simply buy out the competition, and this is one of those occasions.
GID00001067	The Gun Runners detected an intruder roaming around, so they'll like be aware of the theft soon enough.
GID00001068	This unfortunate circumstance will prevent us from immediately using their blueprints to manufacture weapons. A pity.
GID00001069	The Gun Runners will be looking for revenge for the murder of their people. I won't sell you out, but be careful out there.
GID00001070	We'll be unable to make use of their schematics any time soon. Not what I was hoping for when I asked you to do the job. Take your pay.
GID00001071	I hear it's business as usual at the Gun Runners, as if nothing unusual happened. Excellent work.
GID00001072	We'll be able to use the schematics you acquired to begin manufacturing our own weapons immediately. We'll provide some to you at a discount.
GID00001073	I can probably handle that. Just the same as changing a light bulb, except stickier and smellier. Right?
GID00001074	Anyway, what did you bring me?
GID00001075	That puts a dent in the town treasury. If that's what it takes to be rid of them...
GID00001076	Whoa, whoa. Thought you looked familiar. I'm just doing a job, nothing more. Politics aren't my thing, so if you say go, we'll go. No hard feelings.
GID00001077	Because you're a friend of the Followers, I can give you a bit of a discount.
GID00001078	Very well.
GID00001079	Thought I recognized the fellow with you. So, what's this reunion all about, then?
GID00001080	There's a name I haven't heard in awhile. So, what's this reunion all about, then?
GID00001081	Hello, Arcade. Making some new friends, are you?
GID00001082	Why the need for a bunch of old warhorses like us?
GID00001083	Why the need for a bunch of old warhorses like us?
GID00001084	Antique rangefinder? I'm trying to think of something that'd be more worthless.
GID00001085	Maybe an antique horoscope. Or an antique sandwich.
GID00001086	I'll tell you something. Good luck finding that thing. But if you do find it, don't waste your time trying to sell it to me.
GID00001087	All right, that's a start. But now you have to convince them to support my Legion.
GID00001088	Tell them they'll be allowed to continue practicing their dietary habits without interruption. They can eat a portion of what they conquer.
GID00001089	Good. Your first challenge will be to reach their settlement without getting blown up. After that, should be easy.
GID00001090	[SUCCEEDED] And you think the value of their attack on HELIOS, the chaos it will sow behind the Profligates' lines, is worth letting them live.
GID00001091	All right, let it be so. The Brotherhood will have to be dealt with eventually, but for the moment, they live to serve.
GID00001092	[FAILED] And you think they'll stop at that? How long before they attack the dam, or Vegas?
GID00001093	The risks outweigh the rewards. Go back to their bunker and finish the job.
GID00001094	Good. I don't know what kind of security he has inside the Lucky 38, but if you can find a way of catching him off-guard, do so.
GID00001095	Is that right? You are good, aren't you?
GID00001096	If the Boomers are out of the picture, I can focus on other preparations - but not without first rewarding your initiative. Now moving on...
GID00001097	Is that so? You are good, aren't you?
GID00001098	If the Boomers will toe the line, I can focus on other preparations. But not without first rewarding your initiative. Now moving on...
GID00001099	The leader of the tribe is a woman named Marjorie. My understanding is that she strongly opposes a reversion to cannibalism.
GID00001100	If she's intractable, you might find Mortimer, her second-in-command, more flexible.
GID00001101	You destroyed the Brotherhood's bunker? Very well.
GID00001102	I'll trust your word, and reward you as though you wreaked this destruction at my behest.
GID00001103	Of course, if the Brotherhood should suddenly rise up to oppose my rule, you will be held responsible. Now, moving on...
GID00001104	Very well. This latest victory brings to a close my efforts to reshape the power balance of the Mojave - and not a minute too soon...
GID00001105	That's what I like to hear.
GID00001106	One of my Frumentarii has set up camp near Hoover Dam. His name his Cato Hostilius.
GID00001107	Go to him. He'll have further instructions.
GID00001108	Don't have it. Benny stole it, right before he stabbed us in the back. He's probably back at the Strip by now, laughing at me.
GID00001109	One of my patrols was on its way back from Novac when it came under fire from the Great Khans.
GID00001110	They radioed for reinforcements, but instead of waiting for us, they chased the Khans into the ruins where they were caught in a crossfire.
GID00001111	No deaths, but not all of the squad got out. The Khans have Private Ackerman and Private Gilbert as hostages.
GID00001112	You're right about that. Saint James! Got a thief here!
GID00001113	Oh, I think I'd like that. A lot. Maybe even give you a discount for my... company.
GID00001114	You did? Well, that's one hell of a service to humanity, then.
GID00001115	I guess I always thought maybe I'd be the one to do it, but I just... never got my nerve up.
GID00001116	Maybe I'll sleep good tonight... Here, take this. It's how I say thanks.
GID00001117	It's about time. I saw some of the townies gathering at the saloon, so we've got a militia to take down. We get rid of them and we own this place.
GID00001118	Good. We'll still need a plan before we rush the town. I don't want to embarrass myself and get beat by a bunch of townies.
GID00001119	We ain't got much in the way of supplies, so if you could shake down the old doctor and the store owner for some stuff, we'd be in good shape.
GID00001120	Once you're done with that stuff - or none of it - say the word and we'll make our move.
GID00001121	I figure we'll hang around Goodsprings for awhile, maybe get some of the other gangs to join up with us.
GID00001122	Won't kill anybody else unless we have to. Just as long as people do what we tell them, they'll be all right.
GID00001123	[SUCCEEDED] All right, but put everything back the way you found it!
GID00001124	[FAILED] No offense, pardner, but I'd rather not have you rooting around in there. It's technical-like.
GID00001125	Oh, b-b-because of what that fuck Cook-Cook did? W-well, it's n-not the same thing, but D-Doc Usanagi helped me with my s-s-stuttering.
GID00001126	The d-doc has a c-clinic north of here. Can't m-m-miss it. You should t-talk to Bitter-Root, too. He's b-been to see the doc, too.
GID00001127	It's a pride thing with her, and totally unnecessary. I mean, look at me - I was Ranger Sterling until the Legion got through with me.
GID00001128	I was bitter, but if I'd kept my mouth shut, the NCR would've discharged me and sent me home. Instead, I asked if there was still a place for me.
GID00001129	I had to prove I could still handle a gun alongside all the recruits, but look at me now - First Recon and still going strong. You tell Betsy that.
GID00001130	Whatever you need, we'll make sure it gets done.
GID00001131	If you need help from my team, just give the word. Driver Nephi's earned himself a few bullets in the gut.
GID00001132	10 of Spades really ought to keep his mouth shut, but he's right. There were a lot of things in my past I just couldn't leave behind.
GID00001133	It helped. A little. Well, more than a little. Betsy ought to pay a visit to Usanagi since it can't hurt none.
GID00001134	This is Powder Ganger territory - my territory. Most of the guys around here understand that. One, Chavez, doesn't.
GID00001135	Chavez formed his own crew and have been hitting traders on their own. Everybody I've sent after him either got killed or weren't able to catch him.
GID00001136	That leaves you. What do you say?
GID00001137	Nothing's changed. Chavez won't answer to me, but he and his crew operate in my territory. Deal with him.
GID00001138	Sounds like they're already here. There's no way I'm letting them take me alive.
GID00001139	There's no reason for you to stick around and help us, but feel free to kill a few of the bastards on your way out.
GID00001140	I'm happy you cleaned that up for me, but we've got another situation to worry about. There's a merchant hanging around near the prison.
GID00001141	Something feels funny about him, and I want you to deal with him. Shake him down if he's legit, but if he's not, take him out.
GID00001142	Good. Had him figured for NCR, one of the rangers maybe. Anyway, speaking of the NCR, I need you to take a walk down to Primm.
GID00001143	The NCR hasn't raised hell over our breakout, and I want to find out why. They're up to something, I can feel it.
GID00001144	Assuming an NCR pardon comes with the job - and it had better - I'll also need to be able to do things my own way.
GID00001145	Due process has its place, but sometimes it's just a waste of time. I'll need to know that I'm not going to end up right back in prison.
GID00001146	My terms are the same. A pardon from the NCR and the freedom to do the job anyway I see fit.
GID00001147	The loss of morale in the NCR must have been staggering when their leader fell. It's proof that no one is out of the Legion's reach.
GID00001148	We are preparing to move against the Dam, and Legate Lanius has a part for you to play in the battle. Report to him at his camp.
GID00001149	Killing Kimball would've struck fear into the NCR. It's unfortunate that you weren't able to take advantage of this opportunity.
GID00001150	We are preparing to move against the Dam, and Legate Lanius has a part for you to play in the battle. Report to him at his camp.
GID00001151	No... I suppose not. You've proved that you're a friend to us many times. I apologize for my temper.
GID00001152	Very well. I'll have him seized and brought to Caesar as his personal physician.
GID00001153	So shall I have him seized or not?
GID00001154	Killing Kimball would've struck fear into the NCR. It's unfortunate that you weren't able to take advantage of this opportunity.
GID00001155	We are preparing to move against the Dam, and Legate Lanius has a part for you to play in the battle. Report to him at his camp.
GID00001156	We are preparing to move against the Dam, and Legate Lanius has a part for you to play in the battle. Report to him at his camp.
GID00001157	Little escapes the notice of Caesar. He has eyes everywhere.
GID00001158	I am Vulpes Inculta, of Caesar's Legion. I serve my master as the greatest of his Frumentarii.
GID00001159	I am the greatest of his Caesar's Frumentarii. It was not a challenge to find you. Nor is this my first visit to the Strip.
GID00001160	Yeah, was a stupid idea, anyway. See you around.
GID00001161	Hmm... this is exactly the kind of symbol the Khans could unite behind.
GID00001162	We'll begin readying the camp to move. As soon as Caesar makes his move, we'll depart. We will make ourselves strong again, and we shall conquer!
GID00001163	Hmm... this is exactly the kind of symbol the Khans could unite behind.
GID00001164	We'll begin readying the camp to move. As soon as Caesar makes his move, we'll depart. We will make ourselves strong again, and we shall conquer!
GID00001165	Great Khans! Drive Caesar's dog out of our camp! If he's too slow to flee, kill him!
GID00001166	Glad to hear it! I'll switch over all radio broadcasts to the new encrypted channels - this ought to help us stay a step ahead of any spies.
GID00001167	Before you go, I've got another job available.
GID00001168	The station's been silent for quite some time now... I guess this confirms what we've all feared. Thanks for letting me know.
GID00001169	I'll switch over all radio broadcasts to the new encrypted channels - this ought to help us stay a step ahead of any spies.
GID00001170	Before you go, I've got another job available.
GID00001171	We've received some disturbing reports from some of the Ranger stations - heavy casualties at Alpha, Super Mutant Legionaries at Delta.
GID00001172	The weirdest one has to be the Great Khans and their trained Deathclaws at Foxtrot. These reports can't be accurate. Can they?
GID00001173	I know you've already been out there, but could you do me a solid and confirm these reports with the Rangers who sent them in?
GID00001174	Have you now? Hmm. Well, you're a bold one, I'll give you that, but why should I do this for you?
GID00001175	Hmm. I have heard some things from my most trusted Khans that makes me wonder whether this alliance is a good idea after all.
GID00001176	But I want to leave a legacy of greatness when I die. My tribe deserves better than this, cowering in a canyon and living on scraps.
GID00001177	Tell me then, if I don't join with Caesar's Legion, where will I find my tribe's lost glory?
GID00001178	I heard you try to convince Papa Khan not to join with Caesar's Legion. I'd like to talk to you about that for a moment.
GID00001179	Let me see. My God, this is even worse than I thought. Okay, you have my support. I'll tell Papa the alliance is a bad idea.
GID00001180	What do you want to know?
GID00001181	That's a complicated question. They've done horrible things to our people to be sure, and I've gladly killed many of their soldiers in battle.
GID00001182	But I can't bring myself to hate them the way Papa does. Things would damn sure be better for us if they were in charge than Caesar.
GID00001183	You're the chief now. What do we do?
GID00001184	Without Papa Khan's guidance, I don't know what else to do. All right - you can tell the NCR the Great Khans will fight for them when Caesar attacks.
GID00001185	Oh, it's cool, man. Diane passed me the haps on that fandango with Anders. I got your back.
GID00001186	Oh, it's cool, man, I got your back.
GID00001187	Huh? Look, man, me and Diane, we don't dig on that politics stuff, savvy? We just make the product and make it get to a good home.
GID00001188	Sure, Caesar's a drag, but as long as we got each other, we don't care who the top dogs roll with.
GID00001189	Oh, it's cool, kitten. Diane passed me the haps on that fandango with Anders. I got your back.
GID00001190	Oh, it's cool, kitty cat, I got your back.
GID00001191	Huh? Look, kitty cat, me and Diane, we don't dig on that politics stuff, savvy? We just make the product and make it get to a good home.
GID00001192	Sure, Caesar's a drag, but as long as we got each other, we don't care who the top dogs roll with.
GID00001193	Doctor Henry? Now there's a name I haven't heard in years. Hard to believe he's still alive.
GID00001194	As for your request, it's, uh, a bit ghoulish if you ask me, but Rey is pretty old and I'll probably have to put him down soon enough.
GID00001195	As for the price for this favor, 700 caps sounds about right. Rey's like family, and I've got other dogs to take care of.
GID00001196	Like I said before, give me 700 caps and Rey's brain is yours.
GID00001197	Don't worry, Jack and I have talked it over. We'll talk up the idea of breaking the alliance.
GID00001198	Anders got back a little while before you did, he told me what happened. If that's how the Legion treats my people, I don't want any part of them.
GID00001199	Hey, it's not like I'm super-attached to working with Caesar or anything, but if it'll stop his patrols from harassing my runners, I'm all for it.
GID00001200	Ah, yes. I think I know which friend you mean. Even if there weren't Deathclaws in the quarry, there'd still be no delivery.
GID00001201	The supplier, a guy in Primm named Tyrone, is a cheating son of a bitch who won't deliver even though he's already been paid in advance.
GID00001202	It's neural degradation. Bio med gel can only preserve a living brain for so long, so you'll need to find a replacement.
GID00001203	I haven't left Jacobstown in years, but there was one woman in Novac... Gibson? I remember her living with a pack of hounds.
GID00001204	Aside from her, I know that the Fiends and Caesar's Legion fight alongside dogs. There could be viable specimens among them, if you can get to them.
GID00001205	I don't see him with you. Bring him to me and I'll take a look. Otherwise, I'll just be guessing.
GID00001206	Who won the second Battle of Hoover Dam?
GID00001207	No one by that name has come here, I'm afraid. You must've heard wrong. You can ask around if you'd like - they'll all tell you the same thing.
GID00001208	I suppose there's no point in denying it any longer. I killed Corporal White to protect Westside's self-reliance. It was rash, and I regret it now.
GID00001209	We don't have the money to pay for the water, so I rigged the pump station to divert water to the local cisterns from time to time.
GID00001210	Cyber-dog? Like the ones I've seen up in Denver? I know what you're talking about, and it would make Lupa immortal in a way.
GID00001211	You sure? Last chance to back out.
GID00001212	That's okay, I'll fix him! Can I have him now?
GID00001213	No, imbecile, that's not how it works. I set up the fights, then you go in the arena and fight.
GID00001214	Thank you, Colonel Moore. And thank you, my fellow Californians, who have come so far to answer the call to service put forth by the republic.
GID00001215	It is for you that I have come here, and it is because of you that I am able to do so.
GID00001216	We enjoy our privileges because you take the greatest of risks and are prepared to make the most noble of sacrifices.
GID00001217	It is because of men and women like Private First Class Jeremy Watson that Nevada and the New California Republic remain free and secure.
GID00001218	Born in a tin shack on the outskirts of One Pine, Jeremy Watson never had it easy.
GID00001219	His father worked as a caravan guard on the Short Loop, and his mother, like many Californians, braved the ruins of the Old World as a prospector.
GID00001220	They suffered through water shortages, raider attacks, and the Brotherhood War. Like our mighty Sierra Nevadas, they endured.
GID00001221	But the time came when they could no longer shoulder the burden alone.
GID00001222	Twelve years ago, they called out for help, and the republic heard them. Troopers and rangers, just like you, answered the clarion call.
GID00001223	Men and women stepped forward to say, "I will carry the weight."
GID00001224	And at Owen's Lake, we made true on our promise, driving out the raider tribes to establish a lasting peace in the eastern Sierra Nevadas.
GID00001225	We carried the weight, and though we left behind many of our brothers and sisters on that battlefield, it did not break us.
GID00001226	Ten years ago, Chief Elise met with representatives of the Desert Rangers to discuss terms of what would become the Ranger Unification Treaty.
GID00001227	The treaty was more than a resolution to welcome the Desert Rangers into the republic.
GID00001228	It was a covenant to protect southern Nevada against Caesar's Legion and the tyranny of his regime.
GID00001229	There are some back home who ask me, "But who are we protecting? What is Nevada to us?"
GID00001230	Sometimes we forget that the light of our society shines beyond our borders.
GID00001231	Sometimes we take those privileges for granted that our forebears fought so hard to achieve.
GID00001232	We must always remember that wherever Californians stand, we carry our principles with us:
GID00001233	equal respect, representation, and protection under the laws of a just republic.
GID00001234	This was the same fire that burned in the heart of the Old World that preceded us.
GID00001235	We are the heirs of that civilization, torchbearers eastward of the Pacific, into the darkness of this wasted land.
GID00001236	When the republic called on the men and women of California to carry that fire across the Mojave, Jeremy Watson answered. You answered.
GID00001237	Together, you carried the weight. And when PFC Watson's platoon came under attack at Forlorn Hope, he took the greatest risk,
GID00001238	not only for his fellow Californians, but for California itself.
GID00001239	He was prepared to make the most noble of sacrifices, to defend the principles of our republic, even here, on Nevada soil.
GID00001240	His actions are a beacon to all of us who stand here today in tribute to his valor.
GID00001241	Private First Class Jeremy Watson, on behalf of the senate and people of the New California Republic,
GID00001242	it is my honor to present you with the Star of Sierra Madre.
GID00001243	Not far from this spot, a monument stands as a tribute to the sacrifice made by those who came before us,
GID00001244	the men and women who fulfilled the promise we made to the Desert Rangers.
GID00001245	Its back is inscribed with the names of the troopers and rangers who carried the weight.
GID00001246	And because they made the most noble of sacrifices, it did not break us.
GID00001247	Four years ago, we held this dam. Four years ago, we carried the weight.
GID00001248	Four years ago, we drew a line through the Mojave as clear as the Colorado River, a line that Caesar cannot cross.
GID00001249	Today, you stand here with our brothers and sisters to hold that line. Today, you honor all Californians by carrying that weight.
GID00001250	Today, you are the waves of the Pacific, pushing ever eastward. You are the sequoias rising from the Sierra Nevadas, defiant and enduring.
GID00001251	You are the great western light of California, torchbearers in the darkness, living reminders of all that is best in our republic.
GID00001252	Thank you. Thank you.
GID00001253	Okay, let's get the fuck out of here. What the hell are you waiting for? You think I want to get shot? Let's go!
GID00001254	Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to thank you for coming out here today for this very special occasion.
GID00001255	It is my pleasure to introduce to you. The President of the New California Republic, Aaron Kimball!
GID00001256	Tell your ruler we have no interest in such ties. Caesar's Legion is a collection of unclean barbarians.
GID00001257	Any time the White Glove Society is mentioned in the same breath, it sullies our good name.
GID00001258	As much as Mortimer and some of the other members have tried to convince me otherwise, I will not have us seen as savages.
GID00001259	Looking to elevate his social status, is he?
GID00001260	I'll admit, I could see benefits to living under his rule. Certain... transgressions he'd be willing to overlook.
GID00001261	But that's neither here nor there, I'm afraid. Marjorie won't have it, as long as she fails to see the wisdom of my perspective.
GID00001262	I don't care for their incivility or the hodgepodge of sporting equipment that passes for fashion with them.
GID00001263	Nevertheless, I have heard Caesar has a stately dignity about him. And I understand his policies will agree with our new menu.
GID00001264	I prefer Mr. House, of course, but he may not be around forever. And the NCR will surely set back our cuisine. Tell your Mr. Caesar we are with him.
GID00001265	You there! Stop!
GID00001266	Imposter!
GID00001267	An outsider! In the bunker!
GID00001268	The name's Knight. Billy Knight. And this here is what a lifelong career in comedy will get you.
GID00001269	Really? The Tops, huh? Well, it's no Shark Club, but I hear security on the Strip is real tight. Even Mr. Bishop wouldn't hit a joint like that.
GID00001270	I'll check it out. Thanks!
GID00001271	I saw him heading for his suite just a few minutes ago. Looked like a fox that just got caught in the henhouse. Maybe you'll catch him there.
GID00001272	It was a while ago! He came through in a real hurry - didn't even stop to say hello! I think he went down his secret escape elevator out in the hall!
GID00001273	Dig it, baby, he beat feet to his suite. You scare the big boss man or something?
GID00001274	Sure! He came through here in a big hurry - didn't even stop to say hello! I think he went down his secret escape elevator out there in the hall!
GID00001275	He was around not too long ago. He's probably down on the casino floor now.
GID00001276	You can wait for him here, if you like. I'm incapable of asking you to leave.
GID00001277	No problem. Hey, do me a favor when you get back to Reyes and tell her that we don't need any more damn ammo. Wouldn't mind more water, though.
GID00001278	Good question! My function is to monitor Mr. House's data network and decode his encrypted transmissions!
GID00001279	Allow me to introduce myself! I'm a PDQ-88b Securitron, but you can call me Yes Man!
GID00001280	Ain't been on the strip long, have you, pal? Name's Swank. This is my joint.
GID00001281	Baby, I'm the best thing that ever happened to you. Name's Swank. This here's my joint.
GID00001282	I have the delightful task of tabulating stockpiles, kill ratios, mission success rates, radiation deaths, and other truly fascinating numbers.
GID00001283	I've come across numerous inconsistencies between our numbers and our reports - especially with regards to intercepting hostiles.
GID00001284	I'm wondering if our radio security codes have been compromised. I need someone to deliver security code upgrades to each of the Ranger stations.
GID00001285	I am ready to process our transaction.
GID00001286	I respect the way you've conducted yourself around here. Reminds me of myself in some ways.
GID00001287	From now on, you want to buy from Chet's, I'll give you wholesale prices.
GID00001288	Can do.
GID00001289	Too dangerous. Gonna kill all yourselves if I let you touch it. Better to leave it buried - safer that way.
GID00001290	Told you before - it's too dangerous for a bunch of amateurs to handle.
GID00001291	Yeah. He doesn't look very tough, though. I hear he's afraid I'll shoot him down from one of the windows when I see him, and he's right.
GID00001292	I'll have a much bigger problem once his friends show up. There's no way I could handle all of them in a gunfight.
GID00001293	I'm going to lay low for as long as I can, assuming the town doesn't throw me to the wolves. I've got no chance against the gang on my own.
GID00001294	I'm still laying low.
GID00001295	Got a special discount for you, after what you done for us.
GID00001296	I'm sure I've got something you'll like.
GID00001297	Say no more. I'm in.
GID00001298	No. I got a funny feeling about you, and there's no way I'm trusting you to watch my back.
GID00001299	Let me get out of town before we talk. Too many unfriendly ears around.
GID00001300	What the hell for? Just farmers and ranchers out here. Not much worth stealing.
GID00001301	Didn't you already ask me about this? What the hell for - this place is worthless.
GID00001302	Err, thanks, I guess. Cobb wasn't the problem, though - I could've handled him if he ever found me.
GID00001303	Cobb's friends are the bigger problem, and when he doesn't get back, they'll be coming here for blood. There's no way I fight can them all.
GID00001304	Trouble with rustlers? Count me in, pardner. Those varmints will be running home with their tails between their legs soon enough.
GID00001305	I've already talked to Anderson, actually. Came in, confessed, and gave you credit for the whole thing.
GID00001306	First time I've ever seen anything like that. Was like you'd done him some huge favor. I've gotta hand it to you.
GID00001307	This Dazzle must be some girl.
GID00001308	Don't tell me. He married the hooker.
GID00001309	The rapist with the flamethrower? Yeah, that's a combination I stay the fuck away from.
GID00001310	I was stalking him for a while. I'm real good at that. Watching people from where they can't see me, you know?
GID00001311	Only one thing I learned about that asshole. He keeps a bunch of Brahmins. Most of them he roasts whenever he feels like it, but there's one...
GID00001312	...must be his pet, or some shit. Doesn't let anybody near that Brahmin. Somebody puts a bullet in her, I bet that'd piss him off good.
GID00001313	Might make him careless, too.
GID00001314	That right? You killed one of the psychopaths on my shitlist? Let me see the scumbag's head...
GID00001315	You killed another one? Let me have a look at the head...
GID00001316	If that's true, that'd be the last of them...
GID00001317	Goddammit. That's Violet, all right. You've made me one happy son of a bitch, you know that?
GID00001318	Here. This is the bounty I put on her head. It's yours.
GID00001319	Well, that could be Violet, or it could be someone else entirely. I'll take your word for it, but I can't give you a full reward.
GID00001320	Well, well, well. Driver Nephi. Nothing to say, you son of a bitch? No tips on my golf swing?
GID00001321	Lost a lot of good men to this psychopath. Morale's going to be better, now that he's gone. Here's the bounty I promised.
GID00001322	I guess we can send 1st Recon down to Camp Forlorn Hope. They need all the help they can get there.
GID00001323	Well, well, well. Driver Nephi. Nothing to say, you son of a bitch? No tips on my golf swing?
GID00001324	Lost a lot of good men to this psychopath. Morale's going to be better, now that he's gone. Here's the bounty I promised.
GID00001325	Now that's over with, I'd send 1st Recon down to Camp Forlorn Hope, but I heard it's overrun by the Legion. Bastards.
GID00001326	That's supposed to be Driver Nephi? The head's in really bad shape, so I can't authorize a full reward. If he really is dead, we're all better off.
GID00001327	I guess we can send 1st Recon down to Camp Forlorn Hope. They need all the help they can get there.
GID00001328	That's supposed to be Driver Nephi? The head's in really bad shape, so a full reward is out of the question.
GID00001329	Now that's over with, I'd send 1st Recon down to Camp Forlorn Hope, but I heard it's overrun by the Legion. Bastards.
GID00001330	Yeah... that's Cook-cook. Did he always smell like this? Even before he was dead? And the Fiends let this guy touch their food?
GID00001331	Well... this is payback for at least one of my troopers. She'll be glad to know he's dead. Here's your caps.
GID00001332	This is Cook-cook? You sure did a number on his face. I'm not allowed to give you the full reward, but thanks for taking this guy down.
GID00001333	It's payback for at least one of my troopers. She'll be glad to know he's dead. Here's your caps.
GID00001334	Think you can take down another one of these scumbags? Up to you. But I can trust you to do the job, and I'd hate to see you walk away.
GID00001335	That's two psychopaths dead. If you can bring down the third, there's a bonus in it for you.
GID00001336	You've been one hell of a stroke of good luck, you know that? Those three scumbags probably killed twenty NCR troopers. And you bring them down alone.
GID00001337	Wish I had a few grunts as good as you. Damn good working with you.
GID00001338	Am I selling? Yeah. Am I selling to you? No. Sorry to hurt your feelings, but you're small time. Move along.
GID00001339	[SUCCEEDED] You might be on to something. I like to hang on to any weapons mods I run across...
GID00001340	Take a look.
GID00001341	[FAILED] Do I look like a fucking arms caravan to you?
GID00001342	Do you think the Gun Runners keep the NCR military supplied by carrying weapons and ammo from the Boneyard out here by the armload?
GID00001343	Get a clue. We have caravans. We deal in bulk.
GID00001344	Take a look.
GID00001345	That's not too bad. If that's what it takes to be rid of them...
GID00001346	My caravan was on the return trip from California and heading back up to the company branch in New Vegas when we got jumped.
GID00001347	Not even a "drop your weapons and hands up" before the bullets started flying. We put up a good fight, but there was too many of them.
GID00001348	I took a few of the bandits down before I ran, so I figure their friends are out for revenge.
GID00001349	A silver tongue would help. Convincing Trudy that we had a good plan to win the fight would also help.
GID00001350	I should have you torn apart for speaking like that - but maybe you're right. The glory of the past is an empty dream.
GID00001351	If the Khans are to be immortal, we must make our own destiny. We won't fight for Caesar, but when he strikes, we will ride out one last time.
GID00001352	The demons appeared from nowhere... except it might be more accurate to say they never actually "appeared" at all.
GID00001353	The demons are invisible. Where one of them stands, the most one sees is the air shimmering, like sunlight on water...
GID00001354	They set upon us as we were on our way to worship one morning. We had just entered the basement.
GID00001355	My flock fought bravely, and killed a few, but at such cost. Nearly half of us died or went missing.
GID00001356	The rest of us retreated up here. One of the demons raved at us, but they have not tried to attack us since.
GID00001357	Still, their demonic presence brought all progress towards the Great Journey to a standstill.
GID00001358	But now you have come. Once again, the creator has sent a human to help us across a seemingly insurmountable obstacle.
GID00001359	Yes, over the intercom. Threats of death should we step outside, guarantees of safety should we stay locked away.
GID00001360	It went on for hours, and did not always make sense. But that was the first day only. Since then, silence.
GID00001361	Will you drive away the demons, wanderer?
GID00001362	Yes, wanderer?
GID00001363	Damn it. That'll wipe out the town treasury. If that's what it takes...
GID00001364	I don't think "give" is in Chet's vocabulary. Even with the town at stake, he'd still make you barter with him.
GID00001365	[SUCCEEDED] Well-spoken, traveler. Well spoken indeed. Perhaps it's time to find our own destiny unburdened by the past.
GID00001366	We'll begin readying the camp to move. As soon as Caesar makes his move, we'll depart. We will make ourselves strong again, and we shall conquer!
GID00001367	Great Khans! Drive Caesar's dog out of our camp! If he's too slow to flee, kill him!
GID00001368	[SUCCEEDED] Well-spoken, traveler. Well spoken indeed. Perhaps it's time to find our own destiny unburdened by the past.
GID00001369	We'll begin readying the camp to move. As soon as Caesar makes his move, we'll depart. We will make ourselves strong again, and we shall conquer!
GID00001370	[FAILED] You talk like glory is a hollow, meaningless thing. Maybe to you it is, but not to the Great Khans.
GID00001371	Show me something to inspire my people, or we march with Caesar, despite my misgivings.
GID00001372	Thanks.
GID00001373	Good. Glad you didn't kill them. Letting them walk away proves we're not bloodthirsty mutants.
GID00001374	If NCR or anybody else is looking for an excuse to attack Jacobstown, they're not going to get it from us.
GID00001375	Easy Pete's pretty protective of his dynamite. You'd have to convince him you know a thing or two about explosives before he handed it over.
GID00001376	[SUCCEEDED] I should have you torn apart for speaking like that - but maybe you're right. The glory of the past is an empty dream.
GID00001377	If the Khans are to be immortal, we must make our own destiny. We won't fight for Caesar, but when he strikes, we will ride out one last time.
GID00001378	The Followers of the Apocalypse keep many records of the past. It's been a long time since we associated with them, but they might have something.
GID00001379	Until you do find me something, though, know that I still plan to lead the Great Khans to fight for Caesar.
GID00001380	Doc's inside the Lodge.
GID00001381	This shouldn't be too surprising, but I'd prefer you let the Followers examine him. Hopefully the reasons are obvious.
GID00001382	How many chips would you like?
GID00001383	All right, all right! I believe you. Just don't say anything to my folks. You can tell the old hag I'm gone.
GID00001384	No, not yet.
GID00001385	It looks like that last bit you brought me was enough to fill the quota.
GID00001386	Here are the caps I promised you. Make sure to let Contreras know the extra guns and ammo will be in the next shipment.
GID00001387	Something tells me this isn't the first time you've done things that the NCR would find... objectionable.
GID00001388	Here, take some of these. And don't tell anyone where you got them.
GID00001389	I shouldn't have said anything in the first place, and I'd rather not get you into the habit of crossing the NCR.
GID00001390	I understand. No hard feelings, but you will, of course, keep our conversation on the matter strictly confidential.
GID00001391	A deal's a deal. We'll be on our way.
GID00001392	I have several basic implants available that can enhance your physical abilities - make you faster, smarter, stronger, that sort of thing.
GID00001393	I've also got two much more expensive implants. One's a sub-dermal implant that will make you more resistant to damage.
GID00001394	The other implant induces a mild regenerative effect. Your wounds will practically heal before your eyes.
GID00001395	Uh, no. Implants, not plants. They're little machines I can put inside you to make you faster, quicker, or smarter. I recommend the smarter implant.
GID00001396	I've also got two much more expensive implants. One's a sub-dermal implant that will make you more resistant to damage.
GID00001397	The other implant induces a mild regenerative effect. Your wounds will practically heal before your eyes.
GID00001398	One other thing I forgot to mention - your body may be able to handle only a limited number of implants.
GID00001399	The healthier you are, the more implants I'll be able give you. Now, what surgery are you considering?
GID00001400	Which surgery option are you considering?
GID00001401	There aren't any more implants I can give you - you've already bought everything I had available.
GID00001402	All right, let me do a quick test to make sure your body can handle another implant...
GID00001403	All right, you're healthy enough to handle another one. Which surgery are you considering?
GID00001404	All right, let me do a quick test to make sure your body can handle another implant...
GID00001405	I'm afraid you can't handle any more implants right now. Your body isn't durable enough to take it. Sorry.
GID00001406	If I say the Brotherhood should be destroyed, it's necessary.
GID00001407	My Legion can win a fight against the Brotherhood of Steel, but it would be costly. Your job is to make sure there's no Brotherhood for us to fight.
GID00001408	Oh? You're going to defy me?
GID00001409	What Marco said is true. The Legion attacked my village when I was 16.
GID00001410	My parents were killed as examples. The rest of us, chained and dragged to some kind of camp. A Centurion there chose me as his tent servant.
GID00001411	He was handsome, and gentle, most of the time. Said it was our secret, and he'd protect me. Gave me little gifts, stupid things.
GID00001412	But Caesar punishes homosexuality with death, and we nearly got caught, and there were suspicions. So when he took me out into the desert...
GID00001413	Well, I knew he was going to get rid of me. So I kicked him where it counts and I ran. And then swam. And ran some more. Wound up here.
GID00001414	Baby, who I am doesn't matter. I'll be anybody you need me to be. It's better that way, you'll see.
GID00001415	I'm just a fantasy come to life. But you already knew that.
GID00001416	Fair enough. Since you seem to have pieced it together, I won't insult you by denying it any further.
GID00001417	I killed Corporal White to protect Westside's self-reliance. It was rash, and I regret it now.
GID00001418	We don't have the money to pay for the water, so I rigged the pump station to divert water to the local cisterns from time to time.
GID00001419	I'll take a look, but you better have a good reason for asking me to violate his privacy.
GID00001420	What?... Those bastards! Selling folks off to the Fiends? Selling children - to Cook-Cook...?
GID00001421	I've seen enough. They're done for, both of them.
GID00001422	What? Why the hell would I want to do that?
GID00001423	This again. What makes you think I've changed my mind?
GID00001424	All right! We got all sorts of shit in here. Nice job. Better take some for yourself in case you get hit.
GID00001425	[SUCCEEDED] I was planning on sitting this one out, but for some reason I can't help but like you. I'm with you.
GID00001426	Let me have a word with a few other folks and I'll see if I can't round up some more members for this militia you're creating.
GID00001427	While everyone does own a gun, we could stand to be a little better equipped. The general store probably has what we need in stock.
GID00001428	[FAILED] All the more reason for me to sit this one out. I'll be rooting for you, though.
GID00001429	If you were able to get Ringo out of this mess, you'd have a decent reputation around Goodsprings. I'd even set you up with a discount.
GID00001430	Of course, helping Ringo would also make the Powder Gangers mad, and they've got a lot of friends out there.
GID00001431	Don't know why you'd want to go do a thing like that. Yeah, you'd get on their good side, but people around here wouldn't appreciate it one bit.
GID00001432	The Lieutenant's been talking to you, hasn't he? Look, I don't need a head doctor - I'm First Recon, damn it.
GID00001433	You don't see the others crying about every little bruise and scrape, do you?
GID00001434	[SUCCEEDED] Just another injury to take care of, huh? Well, when you put it that way... all right. You can tell the Lieutenant I finally caved.
GID00001435	There's a Doctor Usanagi who's supposed to be good at this sort of thing.
GID00001436	[FAILED] I already told you that I'm fine. I don't need a head doc.
GID00001437	That'll be Eddie. You can usually find him sitting in the warden's old chair up in the main building.
GID00001438	Not sure who's gonna take over with Eddie dead.
GID00001439	Have a look.
GID00001440	Go to him, and you will understand.
GID00001441	Well, you see, I... fuck. I'm really a bounty hunter trying to catch some Powder Gangers, but they probably saw through me, just like you did.
GID00001442	I've been hanging around hoping to ambush some of them, but haven't had any success.
GID00001443	[SUCCEEDED] Hmmm... that's a good point. Sorry I, uh, tried to ambush you there. No hard feelings, I hope.
GID00001444	[FAILED] I don't think it's a waste of time. A handful of dead Powder Gangers ought to get the NCR to cough up some caps.
GID00001445	[SUCCEEDED] Guess I was a little too obvious. I'm actually a bounty hunter - I was hoping to bag some Powder Gangers if they tried to rob me.
GID00001446	[FAILED] Yeah, I'm a merchant, just like I said.
GID00001447	As it so happens, I do have some thrust modules, but they're expensive. 500 caps worth of expensive.
GID00001448	Still got them. 250 caps and they're yours.
GID00001449	Still got them. 500 caps and they're yours.
GID00001450	It's nice to see things going the way they're supposed to, for a change. I'm going to pay you out of my own pocket for this one.
GID00001451	Very well, show me what you've brought so that I can analyze its potential.
GID00001452	And your cyber-dog is... where, exactly? I can't perform the operation without him, hopefully for obvious reasons.
GID00001453	You did? Who was it? Any information you can give me would be a big help for my reports.
GID00001454	I appreciate the information, but I really wasn't kidding when I said I didn't have the manpower. If you could deal with him, I'd be in your debt.
GID00001455	I can only do that if you're a friend of the Legion. I don't want to get crucified.
GID00001456	Here. Come back in a day if you need more.
GID00001457	I can't give you any more right now. Come back in a day.
GID00001458	Now why would I want to do that? His performances make me quite a lot of money.
GID00001459	Oh really? Are you going to waste my time again, or do you have something substantive to offer?
GID00001460	I don't know a thing about no missing refugees from that Aerotech camp. Go cry to somebody else.
GID00001461	Yeah, that's a pretty piece of work. Makes me wonder why you'd turn on the NCR, especially when they had us cold.
GID00001462	Here - a souvenir for you. It's Benny's lighter. Shove it up his ass when you catch up with him.
GID00001463	What's to negotiate? The NCR backs off, we walk out of here, nobody gets hurt.
GID00001464	Still going on about this, huh? Pretty sure I already said we want the NCR to back off and let us out.
GID00001465	What? I was talking about Death, kid. Guess that one went right over your head, didn't it? Old Sergeant Dornan would've had a field day with you.
GID00001466	There's a twitch in my trigger finger, I've lost my eagle eyes, and the other day I could've sworn I heard Sergeant Dornan chewing me out.
GID00001467	I'm old and I'm starting to feel it. It's not pleasant, especially when you know your mind's slipping away.
GID00001468	We all gotta go sometime, but I was hoping for something a little more heroic.
GID00001469	Now just hold on. I never voted to take on the Powder Gangers. That's a thousand cap investment you're talking about.
GID00001470	This again? Like I said, I'm against taking on the Powder Gangers. My supplies aren't cheap, you know.
GID00001471	It looks like our little town got itself dragged into the middle of something we don't want anything to do with.
GID00001472	About a week ago, this trader, Ringo, comes into town. Survivor of an attack, he says. Bad men after him, needs a place to hide.
GID00001473	We figured he was just in shock, so we gave him a place to lie low. We didn't actually expect anyone to come after him.
GID00001474	The one in the fancy suit seemed to be calling the shots, that's as much as I know. Other folks in town might know more.
GID00001475	Word of advice, though: if you ever catch up with him, watch out. The man's got cold eyes like a snake. Can't be trusted, I'd say.
GID00001476	What? No!
GID00001477	Yeah, I guess there's a thing or two I could show you. Sounds like you need all the help you can get after what they done to you.
GID00001478	Meet me outside, behind the saloon.
GID00001479	The LT t-t-told you about that? Shit. Man, that's sh-sh-shit.
GID00001480	Th-this again?
GID00001481	Well shit, feel free to stick a knife in the old ego. I thought I'd made a name for myself around here.
GID00001482	Guess that's as good a reason as any to quit this stinkin' trade. No glory. No easy money, no women, and no glory.
GID00001483	Shit, I'd settle just for the women.
GID00001484	Good. That's damn good. I figure it's about time we got lucky out here, so maybe you can snuff one of these maniacs.
GID00001485	Uh, yeah, actually. I'm still good for the money, but I'll get it some other way. You can tell the old hag I'm gone.
GID00001486	All right, then. We'll be on our way.
GID00001487	Some of the other Followers mentioned you. All right - the truth, then.
GID00001488	I killed Corporal White to protect Westside's self-reliance. It was rash, and I regret it now.
GID00001489	We don't have the money to pay for the water, so I rigged the pump station to divert water to the local cisterns from time to time.
GID00001490	It's all about quantity over quality. Trouble is, you'll be cleaning and fixing your gun a lot more than usual when you use those kind of bullets.
GID00001491	He's a convict. Just without the chains. Said his name was Cobb. "Powder Gangers" is what they call themselves. Plenty more like him out there.
GID00001492	[SUCCEEDED] That does sound like a good plan. All right, you seem to know what you're doing, so you can count me in.
GID00001493	Let me have a word with a few other folks and I'll see if I can't round up some more members for this militia you're creating.
GID00001494	While everyone does own a gun, we could stand to be a little better equipped. The general store probably has what we need in stock.
GID00001495	[FAILED] No thank you. Good luck with your, uh, "ambush."
GID00001496	Oh, yeah. F-fine. Just a little st-st-stutter. Had it since I was a kid. Doesn't stop me from k-kickin' ass.
GID00001497	[SUCCEEDED] Damn. Never had you pegged for the drill instructor type, but you got my attention.
GID00001498	You can tell the Lieutenant that I finally caved. I'll... get help. There's a Doctor Usanagi who's supposed to be good at this sort of thing.
GID00001499	[FAILED] "People" ought to mind their own business.
GID00001500	Sure. The outside looks okay, but I think something broke on the inside.
GID00001501	There'd be caps in it for you. I do like to hear what's going on in the world. And that Mr. New Vegas seems like such a gentleman.
GID00001502	Yep, I heard it turn right back on after you got done tinkering with it. Here's some caps for the work.
GID00001503	This was none of their business - or yours. You've got no right to talk to people behind my back about this.
GID00001504	You must have something important in mind. I'm willing to go to this little reunion, but my work here isn't complete.
GID00001505	Help me get my research to a stage where I can hand it over to my assistant, Calamity, and then ask me about this again.
GID00001506	I'm intrigued, so I'll go to this reunion. I'll be handing things over to Calamity, so talk to her if anything comes up.
GID00001507	Oh, you'll need my word from the pass phrase to get into the bunker - "friends." Don't forget it.
GID00001508	Heavy weapons trooper. Nothing better than hosing down a target with an excess of bullets and laser fire.
GID00001509	By the time I got through with things, not much was left standing. Any morons who didn't run when they saw me coming got what they deserved.
GID00001510	Back then, it was war. If we'd been on the winning side, I'd be called a hero.
GID00001511	You must've heard her radio broadcasts? Though why a human would follow her invitation here is beyond me... unless you didn't listen very closely.
GID00001512	The voice on the radio belongs to Tabitha, the "supreme commander" of Black Mountain - or, as she calls it, the "State of Utobitha."
GID00001513	She took control of this place almost two years ago. The Super Mutants here do whatever she says - and she says humans are to be killed on sight.
GID00001514	You're helping the Legion, a slaving army that will almost certainly kill and enslave the majority of people in New Vegas.
GID00001515	What? Did you expect me to applaud your efforts to support a deranged warlord?
GID00001516	Caesar is bad. You are bad for helping him. Please stop.
GID00001517	I have to say I don't understand where you're going with Mr. House. The man's been manipulating the locals for as long as anyone can remember.
GID00001518	If you help him kick the NCR and Legion out, he's going to keep right on doing it. The people in Freeside will be just as bad off as they ever were.
GID00001519	If you can find a way to push Mr. House out of the picture as well, I think everyone will be better off.
GID00001520	Helping the NCR is better than helping Mr. House, but I don't think it's the best solution for the people in New Vegas.
GID00001521	If the NCR can take full control of Freeside and the Strip, it's going to get worse before it gets better.
GID00001522	Besides, even if New Vegas eventually gets representation in the NCR senate, it's not like the NCR runs efficiently.
GID00001523	I think you're on the right track.
GID00001524	The only way to ensure relative safety and independence for the people of New Vegas is to prevent others from taking control of the region.
GID00001525	That means no NCR, no Mr. House, and no Legion.
GID00001526	It could be better. If we can find a way to work toward the independence of New Vegas, that would be ideal.
GID00001527	But really, as long as you don't help out the Legion, anything's better than that.
GID00001528	Mental trauma can be just as debilitating as physical injuries. Fortunately, I'm well-qualified in such treatment. I'll make time in my schedule.
GID00001529	I'm assuming you're referring to mental trauma. I'll make time in my schedule.
GID00001530	That's great! I can't believe you went through all this trouble for me. Thank you!
GID00001531	I see. Well, thank you for trying. I'm off to go see my admirer now.
GID00001532	I never was happier than when I was in the cockpit. I was able to go just about anywhere and everywhere, limited only by the fuel I could carry.
GID00001533	There were more than a few missions where I took the scenic route home just so I could stay in the air. Caught hell for it every time, but worth it!
GID00001534	Some of the things we did were questionable, I know. That's just how it was back then. Figure I've done enough good to make up for any sins, anyhow.
GID00001535	I miss those days sometimes. We all had a purpose, you know? I admit that some of the folks in charge were pretty ruthless.
GID00001536	The rest of us, though - we were just trying to civilize things. The NCR was still new and it didn't look like they'd last all that long.
GID00001537	Then, we lost the oil rig and shortly after that, the base at Navarro. Nobody left except us Remnants.
GID00001538	Weapon mods are things like silencers, scopes, bigger magazines.
GID00001539	Special ammo includes things like armor-piercing bullets which don't hurt the target as much but let you punch through armor easier.
GID00001540	There's also hollowpoint bullets which have the opposite effect - you can kill unarmored targets easier, but they don't do shit against armor.
GID00001541	It is now. Me and the rest of the guys busted out of the NCR prison east of here and took over. Now we're calling the shots.
GID00001542	Cook-Cook, one of the fiends, ambushed her and Ten of Spades. They both managed to escape, but not before Cook-Cook raped her.
GID00001543	Betsy's shrugged it off like it was nothing, but her behavior keeps getting worse - always making passes at every woman who wanders by.
GID00001544	It's inappropriate for anyone in First Recon to behave that way. I could discipline her, but I'd rather she get medical help.
GID00001545	I'd appreciate it. As her CO, I could order her to get help, but I'd have her agree with the idea.
GID00001546	Yes. Talk to Betsy and try to convince her to get medical help for her trauma. I sure hope you understand what I'm asking.
GID00001547	Yes, the others in the squad said you'd come to them about her. It's a start, but let's hope she sticks with her treatment as long as it's necessary.
GID00001548	I'm afraid she'll ditch Usanagi early if she feels its taking too long - she won't want to look bad in the eyes of the rest of First Recon.
GID00001549	I caught the tail end of what you said to her. Betsy looked like she'd been slapped right back into basic for a few seconds there.
GID00001550	Let's hope that Betsy sticks with the treatment. Knowing her, she won't keep seeing Usanagi if she feels things are taking too long.
GID00001551	I wish someone with your medical training had come along sooner. I think she'll actually stick with her treatment because of what you said.
GID00001552	I was afraid that Betsy wouldn't go for long-term treatment because she didn't want to look bad in front of the rest of the squad. You settled that.
GID00001553	Do me a favor and let Usanagi know Corporal Betsy is coming. I'd like to make sure the medical clinic has time for her.
GID00001554	Legionaries - we have a problem!
GID00001555	Oh, so you're talking about one of them packages. That job had strange written all over it. But we couldn't turn down the caps.
GID00001556	Sure. I'll tell you what I know.
GID00001557	Beagle had some notes he was taking while he was eavesdropping around the Powder Gangsters. He'll be your best source of information on that subject.
GID00001558	Well, I don't got any work right now, sorry to say.
GID00001559	I'll tell you whatever I can. Do you have a delivery order you can show me?
GID00001560	Then you'll have to be extraordinarily persuasive. Or kill them - their leaders, at least.
GID00001561	Get to it, will you? You're wasting my time.
GID00001562	So what you're telling me is, you're useless. You have no ability to influence events, so I'm forced to work around your incompetence.
GID00001563	Try to do better with your next assignment...
GID00001564	We keep getting deliveries of ammunition for some reason. I don't mind target practice, but there isn't all that much to shoot at out here.
GID00001565	Radio signal out here can be pretty spotty because of all the hills. Sometimes our scheduled updates don't go through.
GID00001566	When it happens enough times, they send someone over to check up on us. Lately, we've been getting extra medical supplies for some reason.
GID00001567	I'm in no rush to give the supplies back, either.
GID00001568	Yeah, it's a damn shame. There was a lot of talk about expelling her from the Rangers, especially once the gambling and drinking started.
GID00001569	Being posted here is her second and last chance, and so far, I'm not impressed. Lenk's jumpy all the time, and the others are sick of it.
GID00001570	Here's all the caps I've saved up so far. See? That's a pretty good chunk of what I owe right there!
GID00001571	Ah, yes, her infatuation with a Boomer she's never met. It's a small camp, and word gets around.
GID00001572	She's aware she's breaking her contract, which is undoubtedly why she sent you to talk to me instead of coming herself.
GID00001573	Janet is free to leave, but she forfeits the wages she's owed. That's the price of contract breaking - take it or leave it.
GID00001574	My terms haven't changed. Janet is free to leave, but she forfeits the wages she's owed.
GID00001575	Here you go. Let him know he needs to make another payment if he wants more of this stuff.
GID00001576	Alright, whatcha got?
GID00001577	[SUCCEEDED] Wha-? No, no wait. Look, I just need time. Don't rat me out to them.
GID00001578	You want me to quit the Crimson Caravan? Fine, I quit. You can tell McLafferty that she won't see my face again.
GID00001579	[FAILED] As if they'd even talk to you. You're nobody. I'm Henry-fucking-Jamison.
GID00001580	Oh, like you wouldn't believe. The NCR makes a habit out of wrecking homes. I came out here to get away from them - didn't work out so well.
GID00001581	Next thing I know, I'm squatting in "their" land. Never mind that I'd already been living here for years.
GID00001582	Half a year or so. The Casa's a dump and Marco's a pig, but Pretty Sarah makes sure I don't get hassled.
GID00001583	I don't get as many customers as Sweetie or Maude. But the customers I do get always come back.
GID00001584	She's an honest woman. Splits the earnings fair, and keeps Sweetie and Maude in line.
GID00001585	Minds her own business, too. She knows what it's like for people to go through things they'd rather not talk about.
GID00001586	Old but spry, honey. So long as my back don't give out, I can make a living lying on it.
GID00001587	May not be as fresh as Sweetie or Jimmy, but Pretty Sarah keeps me around for a good reason - experience!
GID00001588	They don't look like much, but they earn a pretty good living by selling scrap and salvage.
GID00001589	Dermot saves his money. Saint James spends his on Sweetie. A good customer, that one.
GID00001590	Coyotes? Yeah, they run folks onto the Strip, have some kind of connections over there. Everybody makes a living one way or another.
GID00001591	Dermot saves his money. Saint James spends his on Sweetie. A good customer, that one.
GID00001592	It's worth every cap, baby. I'll do things to you you didn't think was possible, and leave you feeling like everything's right in the world.
GID00001593	I'm not surprised. Whip out your caps and away we go.
GID00001594	Same price as before, baby, and worth every little cap.
GID00001595	If I don't have anything you like, well... tough. I don't do special orders.
GID00001596	You got it.
GID00001597	This? This is - or was - the big house. The New California Republic Correctional Facility. Not much "correcting" went on here, just slave labor.
GID00001598	One day, us prisoners decided to liberate ourselves. Killed the warden, killed the guards, took over the whole damn territory.
GID00001599	Well, I don't know. Depends on if you can make it worth my time. A hundred caps sounds right to me.
GID00001600	Yeah, all right. Figure you could help us out the way you helped out Cobb's crew over in Goodsprings.
GID00001601	Why? It's because I mess up people so bad they don't know what part goes where when I'm done.
GID00001602	I'll grab my tools.
GID00001603	[SUCCEEDED] What you say is true. I apologize for my rash action - it was out of grief and loyalty. I hope you understand.
GID00001604	[FAILED] Save your excuses.
GID00001605	Caesar chose not to give me that information. I was only told to find you and bring you the message.
GID00001606	No, but there really ought to be. I'm just taking the initiative, is all.
GID00001607	You're not stationed here, but your rep with the NCR speaks for itself. It's mostly rifle rounds, but I'll throw in a few boxes of pistol ammo.
GID00001608	I really shouldn't be doing this for you, but there's no way we're going to use all of this or be able to carry it with us.
GID00001609	Sorry, it's against regulation for me to give away NCR supplies to anyone not stationed at this post. Wouldn't want you using it against us.
GID00001610	Do? We don't, like, do anything. We make the magic happen.
GID00001611	We keep the Great Khans from falling apart, essentially. Jack manufactures the chems, I organize the runners and the shipments.
GID00001612	How many chips would you like?
GID00001613	Smart, charismatic. Hell of a mean streak. Doesn't care for humans. Prefers fighting them to talking.
GID00001614	He's got a lot of pull with Nightkin, though. He talks, they listen. Was hoping he could draw other Nightkin to Jacobstown.
GID00001615	Keene is saner than most, but I know he's thinking of going his own way again. He's aggressive, impatient. Can't stand sitting around.
GID00001616	Up to Lily. Not my call. Might lead to a faster cure. Might not. Don't want any harm coming to her.
GID00001617	[SUCCEEDED] I've always known when to fight and when to back down, and it seems to me I ought to back down this time.
GID00001618	My men and I are leaving. You won't see us around here again.
GID00001619	[FAILED] I've faced down a charging Deathclaw and didn't blink. What makes you think I'd back down from you?
GID00001620	Oh... that. Yes. Anderson filled me in on the details. Just let me know when you'd like your... order to be filled.
GID00001621	Yes, it just came in. Here's all of it.
GID00001622	I'm sorry, but your order won't be in for a while. Please come back in a day or two.
GID00001623	Then get yourself back there, and get it done.
GID00001624	I don't have to explain the reasoning behind my commands. I just give them - and you do them.
GID00001625	That said, every once in a while I hear something so ignorant, I have to respond. This is one of those times.
GID00001626	The Profligates' morale is in the shitter. They've occupied the Mojave for years, getting picked off one by one. They were told it'd be easy.
GID00001627	They keep being told that victory is right around the corner, that Vegas will roll over, become the sixth state of their little union.
GID00001628	It's President Kimball who's been telling them that. When he dies, the enormity of his lies will come crashing down, the punchline to a bad joke.
GID00001629	Promising, but I won't be able to synthesize the drug anytime soon. I really should get back to my work.
GID00001630	Hmmm... there's still power, but the casing is cracked. I'm astonished that exposure to the stealth radiation could induce mutations so rapidly.
GID00001631	More importantly, this explains why my research into this group of Nightstalkers hasn't come up with a cure for the Nightkin.
GID00001632	There's only one avenue left for me - I need to run the Mark II test on Lily. It's the only way.
GID00001633	Hmmm... there's still power, but the casing is cracked. I'm astonished that exposure to the stealth radiation could induce mutations so rapidly.
GID00001634	More importantly, this explains why my research into this group of Nightstalkers hasn't come up with a cure for the Nightkin.
GID00001635	I did have a test in mind using Lily, but since she's dead, that's no longer a possibility. Regrettable. Anyway, you've done all you can.
GID00001636	Thank you. I strongly suspect that the source of the mutation is artificial, but the Super Mutants found nothing. Your fresh eyes may do better.
GID00001637	Lily might be interested in coming with you - she's lost a few of her Bighorners to Nightstalker attacks and would enjoy a little revenge.
GID00001638	Let me see that... "filthy savages? Probably have to decimate the lot of them?" Are these the words of our "friend," Caesar?
GID00001639	Great Khans! Drive Caesar's dog out of our camp! If he's too slow to flee, kill him!
GID00001640	What's this? Ah, yes, I've heard that the Legion has sometimes had to quell tribes that did not share its vision.
GID00001641	The Khans, though, are protected by Caesar's emissary - I have Karl's word we will remain our own tribe as long as we remain loyal to Caesar.
GID00001642	Take your slander elsewhere.
GID00001643	Happy to do it.
GID00001644	Humans are always staring at things. We Nightkin don't like being stared at. Is is... uncomfortable.
GID00001645	I'd noticed Snuffles limping, but I didn't realize the problem was that serious. Thanks - that beast helps keep spirits up around here.
GID00001646	<happy bark!>
GID00001647	<whimper>
GID00001648	Then we are out of here. Here - a souvenir for you. It's Benny's lighter. Shove it up his ass when you catch up with him.
GID00001649	She said what? Why didn't she just say so when I was there? Actually, come to think of it, I was pretty angry when I went down there.
GID00001650	I vaguely recall something about upending a few tables, maybe knocking out one of her doctors. Anyway, that's incredible news!
GID00001651	Only thing is, there's too much going on around here for me to make a trip like that, and I need all of my guys just to keep things settled here.
GID00001652	You seem to be awfully interested in my boy Rex here. And you've done some good work for me already. I'll tell you what.
GID00001653	You promise to get Rexie here to that doctor, and I'll lend him to you. What do you say?
GID00001654	Yes? Did you reconsider?
GID00001655	Sure can. Take the road southeast out of town till it hits the freeway. Primm is the town with the roller coaster, straight south. Can't miss it.
GID00001656	NCR patrols do a good job of keeping the highway clear, but I'd keep your gun where you can reach it easily. You never know who you'll run into.
GID00001657	Off the road, you'll probably start running into hostile wildlife. My advice would be to stick to the highway when you can.
GID00001658	Not much, other than they're a bunch of freeloaders who expected a few rounds on the house. I was able to get them to pay up, though.
GID00001659	Of course, one of the Great Khans did knock my radio to the floor "by accident," and it hasn't been working since.
GID00001660	Don't mention it! I'm always ready to lend a helping hand to a stranger in need.
GID00001661	The stupid girl should know by now that even the rags on her back are a privilege. Anyway, my mongrels like their new toy.
GID00001662	Tell you what - you square off with four of my best dogs. No armor and no weapons except a machete. You survive and I let you have the bear.
GID00001663	You ready to fight my mongrels, then?
GID00001664	Well done. It will be very useful in the coming battle against the snipers the NCR will no doubt have hidden in the hills near the Dam.
GID00001665	Know your place, woman. Unlike the Profligates of the NCR, only men fight in the Legion.
GID00001666	Only you may enter. Tell your companion to wait and speak to me again.
GID00001667	That can be arranged. You will be facing off against a couple of disobedient slaves - not much of challenge, but it might be entertaining to watch.
GID00001668	There's a captured NCR trooper available - Sergeant Andrews. He's already been challenged once and survived, so he should be a worthy opponent.
GID00001669	I have a dangerous one for you - an NCR Ranger by the name of Stella. We got lucky, since we rarely capture Rangers alive.
GID00001670	Even though she's a woman, she's killed every man who's faced her in the arena, even one of the elite Centurions. With her bare hands.
GID00001671	Sorry, but there's nobody left who'd even be a challenge for you.
GID00001672	I never finished my training - the Legion saw to that when they overran my town.
GID00001673	I do know basic first aid, but I've had to rely on tribal remedies to treat illnesses and injuries - healing powders and all that.
GID00001674	I'm always running low on xander root. Plenty of broc flowers, though.
GID00001675	Go to him, and you will understand.
GID00001676	So I did. As you may have noticed, our position here in New Vegas is tenuous.
GID00001677	We've made great strides, sure, but the NCR is not welcomed here, merely tolerated. And even then, not by everyone.
GID00001678	We've had reports of violence against NCR citizens in a neighborhood just to the northeast called Freeside. Ever been there?
GID00001679	Yes, have you reconsidered? NCR citizens may be dying as we speak in that hellhole.
GID00001680	Oh, I've already heard. Pacer is dead. The Kings are up in arms. The entire area is gripped by chaos and the violence has only increased.
GID00001681	In fact, I've heard that many are assuming the NCR did it without even looking into the matter. This is the worst thing that could possibly happen!
GID00001682	What do you have to say for yourself?
GID00001683	Oh, I've already heard. The Kings are up in arms. The entire area is gripped by chaos and the violence has only increased.
GID00001684	In fact, I've heard that many are assuming the NCR did it without even looking into the matter. This is the worst thing that could possibly happen!
GID00001685	What do you have to say for yourself?
GID00001686	Yes, do you have something to report?
GID00001687	Yes, how did it go?
GID00001688	Oh, right. She radioed ahead and mentioned that somebody was coming by.
GID00001689	Oh, right. She radioed ahead and mentioned that somebody was coming by. Odd that she'd send a civilian instead of a trooper, though.
GID00001690	"High casualties?" We've had one broken ankle, but nobody at this post has died.
GID00001691	Legionaries?! We have a problem!
GID00001692	Wahoo, you did it pardner! Bully for you! Ol' Festus knew you could do it. I suppose you'll be wanting that prize now.
GID00001693	Well then, hold onto your hat, because it's a doozy. Not many people have heard the true story behind Sunset Sarsaparilla. It's a right honor.
GID00001694	And now, without further ado, your prize - The Legend of the Star...
GID00001695	Looooong ago, people didn't have a heap of choices when it came to soft drinks. It was either water, or Nuka-cola.
GID00001696	Now, the threat of legal action forces me to say that Nuka-cola is a swell beverage, but sometimes people just wanted something different, you know?
GID00001697	So one day a man, a saloon owner in a small town, decided to make a new type of soft drink, and asked his patrons what flavor they'd like it to be.
GID00001698	After getting no help from them, a stranger at the end of the bar suggested the man make a sarsaparilla flavored drink.
GID00001699	The stranger said he would happily share his family's recipe for the drink, on one condition.
GID00001700	The condition being that the stranger would be allowed to sample a bottle whenever he liked, to ensure the recipe was being followed to the letter.
GID00001701	The man happily agreed, thinking the drink would make him rich, and the stranger promised to meet him by sundown the next day.
GID00001702	The next morning, the sheriff stopped by and reported that the stranger's body was found on the side of the town road. He'd been killed by bandits.
GID00001703	The man, cursing his luck, closed the saloon early that day, just as the sun began to set.
GID00001704	But after he had locked the doors, he turned around to find an unfamiliar bottle on the bar, with a note beneath it.
GID00001705	The note was sealed with blue wax in the shape of a star. Opening it, the man found it contained a recipe for a sarsaparilla-flavored drink.
GID00001706	Sampling the bottle's contents and finding it singularly delicious, the man gave silent thanks to his mysterious benefactor, wherever he was.
GID00001707	Being an honorable man, the saloon owner paid for the stranger's funeral, thinking it was the least he could do to repay him.
GID00001708	The saloon owner went on to become rich selling the new drink, and to this day some bottles of Sunset Sarsaparilla have a blue star under their caps.
GID00001709	Some say the saloon owner ordered it done, in honor of the stranger. Others say it's the stranger, sampling the bottles like he promised.
GID00001710	And that's the Legend of the Star. Hope you enjoyed it, and hope you continue enjoying Sunset Sarsaparilla!
GID00001711	By my hat, you're flush with Stars, ain't you? Scratch up a few more and the prize's yours.
GID00001712	Well, what in the Sam Hill are you doing still listening to me? Get a wiggle on and find those last few Stars!
GID00001713	It looks like you've got a fair number of Stars in your saddlebags. You're still a few cards short of a hand, though.
GID00001714	That's a good start there, soft-horn, but that's not enough by a long chalk.
GID00001715	Of course.
GID00001716	This is the New Vegas branch of the Gun Runners, supplying the wasteland with only the finest armaments since 2155.
GID00001717	All right, then. Hopefully I've got something to wet your whistle.
GID00001718	Come talk to me when I'm in my store and I'll be glad to do business with you.
GID00001719	He was a drill instructor I knew. He was also the meanest bastard I've ever known.
GID00001720	Once, he caught this private out of uniform and old Dornan went off on the most ear-blistering rant known to man. It was inspiring.
GID00001721	Bad trouble.
GID00001722	He's some trader who decided he'd rather shoot than pay the toll for being in our territory. He's hiding somewhere in town.
GID00001723	Would serve these idiots right if me and my guys shot the place up after we got payback on Ringo.
GID00001724	The LT, Gorobets, gave it to me. See, I w-w-wanted to be Ace of Spades. But the LT says, sorry kid, you're t-t-too green. So he calls me Ten instead.
GID00001725	It's okay, though. I get a few more k-k-kills under my belt, he'll move me up to Jack. Jack of Spades. Sounds better, right?
GID00001726	I keep at it, eventually I'll make it to Ace. Think I'll skip Queen, though.
GID00001727	You killed him? Well, shit. Here I'd dreamed up this whole elaborate revenge fantasy.
GID00001728	Didn't really think I'd do it, but as long as the tubby bastard was actually alive, I could pretend like I would.
GID00001729	Here. I owe you. Take it and get out of here, before I indulge my inner bitch and spoil the moment.
GID00001730	As a matter of fact... it's funny that you'd ask. Couple nights back, I was on watch in the yard...
GID00001731	Got myself a habit of looking all around - not just where I'd expect to find trouble. Old habit, but it's saved my hide, on occasion.
GID00001732	Round about one in the morning, I spied some lights in the control tower. Now that's the third time I've spied those lights, mind you.
GID00001733	And every time I ask about it, they tell me the place was empty. I'm just saying... it didn't look empty to me.
GID00001734	Because I killed a couple marks for him, that's why. You ever hear of Jackson? Or Night Terror?
GID00001735	Damn right I do. Who do you think you can take down?
GID00001736	The Gun Runners have been putting rapid-fire death-dealing in the hands of anyone who needed to defend himself for over a century.
GID00001737	We're the NCR's #1 supplier of weapons and ammunition. You might call us an unofficial branch of the army.
GID00001738	I'm a salesman. I swing through McCarran and the dam once a week or so to take orders. But lately I spend most of my time in this piss heap.
GID00001739	Ever since the 15 shut down, all caravans come through here - right to me. I check the stock and direct deliveries onward to meet orders.
GID00001740	Sure, it stinks to hang out here, but it won't be forever. Plus I can afford a monthly bender on the Strip and still build up my nest egg.
GID00001741	Like you have a clue what that even means.
GID00001742	This thing on my head is headache medicine. It works real good, except I can't think when it's on. Really think, I mean.
GID00001743	I can take off my medicine and do some thinking. People say it's real interesting. I don't know, because I never hear it.
GID00001744	Some people say that it's a gift. Other people say that it's the kind of thinking anyone could do if they watched more than they talked.
GID00001745	I don't know which is true. I see a lot, I think a lot. There's a lot to hear through the 188, too, that maybe accounts for the thinking.
GID00001746	Squad marksman. I'm pretty proud of the fact that I never killed a single soul who wasn't trying to kill me or one of my team first.
GID00001747	Internal sabotage took down the oil rig - never did get the full story. The NCR took out Navarro, saying we posed a threat to the region.
GID00001748	Shit. Long as I can r-r-remember. Had a rifle in my hand since I was three, that's what my dad always says.
GID00001749	Learned to shoot on our ranch. Way west of here. Same as the LT, he's a f-farm kid too.
GID00001750	I'm sorry to say that it was. Civilian casualties was acceptable and sometimes... encouraged. My former squadmate Moreno didn't need encouraging.
GID00001751	Moreno and I might've killed each other if Captain Kreger hadn't been there to pull us apart.
GID00001752	I was the officer in charge, and Johnson and Moreno were my heavy hitters. Henry handled tech things, and Whitman flew the chopper.
GID00001753	Johnson and Moreno never got along, and I had my hands full keeping those two apart some days.
GID00001754	It was a difference in philosophy, mostly. "Mercy" was not part of Moreno's vocabulary.
GID00001755	Oh. They recruited me... what, a year ago? Taught me to kick even more ass than before. These guys... they really know how to kick some ass.
GID00001756	I'm really very boring. You'd get better stories out of a Freeside junkie.
GID00001757	Won't be a problem. We have plenty of spice traders working with us back home, and we could get meat from local Brahmin ranchers.
GID00001758	The bigger issue is payment. To supply the camp with meat with cost some serious caps.
GID00001759	Absolutely not. Lily's done enough, and she doesn't need to do any more. We're close enough to a cure already, and don't need to rush it.
GID00001760	Doctor Henry. He's one of you - go speak with him instead of me.
GID00001761	Such as?
GID00001762	[SUCCEEDED] That thought had crossed my mind as well, actually. Fine, make it 2000 caps and we'll call it square.
GID00001763	[FAILED] Sorry, but I've got men to pay and equipment to maintain. 2500 caps or no deal.
GID00001764	Vertibird pilot. Seventy-one missions and only lost one chopper. Rotor malfunction over Klamath. Hard landing, but I walked away.
GID00001765	I help tend the crops, stand watch for Fiends, and generally help keep things civilized.
GID00001766	Do? I don't do anything. I'm retired.
GID00001767	I was a soldier. Why do you even care? I came out here to forget about the past, so quit bringing it up.
GID00001768	Uh... okay, look... first, I didn't have anything to do with that trooper. That was all Anderson.
GID00001769	Second, even though the whole scheme was Anderson's idea, it's the only way the co-op could stay in business. The water means everything.
GID00001770	Good. Two of my scouts have reported seeing patrols of men in power armor near Hidden Valley. Begin your search there.
GID00001771	Best prices around so long as you don't try putting anything someplace it was never intended. How's that sound?
GID00001772	If you're looking to get perverted, go talk to Sweetie. She's less particular than I am.
GID00001773	No discounts for repeat customers... I think we did it before, anyways.
GID00001774	I bring in the customers, and she makes sure no one gets rough. Sarah's good people. Good enough, anyway.
GID00001775	Nah, nah - means I poked through old buildings looking for working tech and such. Some folks just call it "salvaging," but never liked the term.
GID00001776	Way I see it, salvage means it's broken, near-worthless. Me, I looked for the good stuff - guns, chems, spare parts. Good money in it.
GID00001777	None of your damn business. You ought to know better than to ask a man that kind of question.
GID00001778	Corporal Sterling was an NCR ranger until he was captured by the Legion. They tortured him pretty badly.
GID00001779	He wasn't able to be a ranger after that, but his eyes are still sharp so I had him transferred to First Recon.
GID00001780	I was always the guy who could get things, if you know what I mean. Figured I might as well keep on doing it.
GID00001781	That's us. We got sent here to fix the rails and make some new ones, and for that we got to use dynamite.
GID00001782	Of course, dynamite works pretty good against caravan guards, too. So, that's what we do - rob and blow things up.
GID00001783	Not much, just killed a bunch of people. Maybe a couple of kids, too. Whatever.
GID00001784	He's the best the Legion has to offer, or so the Legionaries say. Brute of man, wears a fancy metal mask into battle.
GID00001785	He killed one of my pack Brahmin simply because it was in his way. I knew better than to complain about it, though.
GID00001786	I know the Captain well. If you wish to be of service, go talk to him.
GID00001787	Bear in mind that you are now responsible for guarding the secret of his true allegiance. If the NCR finds out, we'll know how that happened.
GID00001788	I know the Captain well. The destruction of the NCR monorail was his doing.
GID00001789	Of course, if the NCR were to hear of that, it would be obvious who told them.
GID00001790	Sure thing. Let me have a look.
GID00001791	Coming from anyone else, I'd say they were drunk or crazy, but that look in your eyes - I believe you.
GID00001792	I can pay you, but it ain't much for what you pulled off. I'll get on the ham radio first thing and tell people all about you, though.
GID00001793	If Ringo doesn't head out on his own, I think we should hand him over. The town shouldn't get itself mixed into the problem.
GID00001794	Don't mistake that for coward talk, though. We're a town of survivors, and we'll fight tooth and nail if pushed, but we don't go looking for trouble.
GID00001795	Was a prospector until I decided to settle here to get away from the NCR. Now I just take it easy and help out with the Brahmin and Bighorners.
GID00001796	Nope. Had a pretty good claim once, way out east by the river, but got run off by Raiders. Eventually, got too old to keep going out.
GID00001797	Not in Goodsprings, no. But if you're up for a little scavenging, there's always the schoolhouse.
GID00001798	Most of what's in there is junk, but there's this old safe that even Easy Pete wasn't able to crack with dynamite.
GID00001799	If you want to take a shot at it, take these.
GID00001800	I know that... thing... as much as anyone else around here. It mostly keeps to itself, which is just fine by me.
GID00001801	Good riddance to it is all I have to say. Never liked having it around.
GID00001802	Violet's got dogs. Lots of dogs. While they're ripping you to shreds up close, she'll be putting rounds through you with her rifle.
GID00001803	Driver Nephi is a monster in close combat with that golf club of his, and that man is about as fast on his feet as any Legionary.
GID00001804	If you haven't already, see about getting Gorobets and First Recon to help you - they've got things to settle with Driver Nephi, too.
GID00001805	Cook-Cook loves using his flamethrower on his victims, usually after he rapes them. Little Buster can tell you more about him than I can, though.
GID00001806	I haven't had the pleasure. I have crossed paths with Legate Lanius, his second-in-command, however. It was... unpleasant.
GID00001807	We recently obtained an artillery weapon, but we don't have the part or the skill to fix it.
GID00001808	The artillery weapon needs the firing mechanism replaced. Any help you can offer would be appreciated.
GID00001809	Such as?
GID00001810	What about it? Do you have some advice?
GID00001811	Thanks to you, I think we're in good shape. The squad seems to be functioning much better as a unit now.
GID00001812	He did, huh? Well, good luck with that. You'd have an easier time teaching radroaches to march in formation.
GID00001813	Hoo-hoo! Hot damn, it's gonna be a party in the camp tonight!
GID00001814	Yo, I'll tell you what this squad needs. A healthy dose of angry juice.
GID00001815	You actually did it? My friend, I am without doubt a genius, but I must say, you've given me a run for my money. Bravo. Bravo.
GID00001816	That seems highly illogical. What reason would he have for doing that?
GID00001817	Boy, the squad sure is working together a lot better now! I think we're gonna be A-Okay!
GID00001818	To me? Well, I'll tell you what I think this squad needs: a little more basic human niceness.
GID00001819	It helped, but we've still got a grenade range inspection to pass.
GID00001820	It really, really didn't.
GID00001821	Not even a little bit, no.
GID00001822	Yeah, what about it? I told you, we need marksmanship and explosive handling improvements.
GID00001823	Like I said, you get the juice, we'll cut loose.
GID00001824	And what do you propose?
GID00001825	You did? Does that mean you're going to help?
GID00001826	Three flavors to choose from - Sweetie, Maude, and Jimmy. Sweetie's the house favorite, for reasons that should be obvious.
GID00001827	Maude is what you might call the discount rack. She's what a customer wears if he doesn't have the caps to afford Sweetie - or just likes them old.
GID00001828	Jimmy's more of a "specialist." I only hear good things.
GID00001829	All right, then. Looks like I need to talk slow and use small words. There's Sweetie, Maude, and Jimmy.
GID00001830	Fewer than I used to. Go see for yourself.
GID00001831	Heh, yeah good old Klamath. Not a bad place if you like hunting, eating, and skinning geckos all day! Heh heh.
GID00001832	It's a pretty dull place, but I hear there was a bit of excitement when this tribal from Arroyo came to town years back. All before my time, though.
GID00001833	Err... yeah. It was a long time ago. Things were better back then.
GID00001834	Kickin' ass. Mostly kickin' ass. See, we're watching the perimeter right now. Looking for those F-f-fiends to come back.
GID00001835	When they show their faces, that's when we go to work. One shot, one k-k-kill. That's the First Recon way.
GID00001836	I call her La Longue Carabine. Didn't always have the scope - I added that myself.
GID00001837	Been shooting with her so long... couldn't bring myself to toss her away. Would have felt guilty to part with the old girl.
GID00001838	The other snipers use bolt-action, but Gorobets reckoned it didn't matter none if I was different, so long as I can hit my targets.
GID00001839	Oh, shit, I don't know. Got to be at least a month. Longer than I last at most jobs.
GID00001840	You trying to start trouble? Or do you really not know where I got that name?
GID00001841	Don't get me wrong - the NCR's got a lot of decent folk in it. It's just that they make you part of them whether you like it or not.
GID00001842	Towns like Goodsprings and Primm don't stay independent for long, not if you've got something the NCR wants. Still, the NCR keeps the Legion away.
GID00001843	They're slavers, led by a guy named Caesar. Or Caesar. Not sure how you're supposed to say it.
GID00001844	A couple of years ago they tried to take over Hoover Dam, but the NCR beat them back. The NCR didn't - or couldn't - finish the job, though.
GID00001845	The Legion's got its strength back and is getting ready for another round at the Dam. My money's still on the NCR winning, but you never know.
GID00001846	We've been hearing stories about Legionaries on the Nevada side of the river, so keep a gun handy. You don't want to get caught by them.
GID00001847	The Dam powers a lot of New Vegas. And then there's all that clean water lying in Lake Mead, too. Anybody who owns the Dam owns the territory.
GID00001848	Meat and hide, mostly. Can't put a pack on 'em - they just lay down until you take it off.
GID00001849	Can find a bunch of wild ones high up in the hills, but gotta be careful around 'em. They can put up a decent fight if cornered.
GID00001850	I help folks strip down the more complicated bits of salvage they bring in - engines, mostly.
GID00001851	The bits and pieces we take out are usually worth more than the whole thing put together.
GID00001852	Couple of years now. I was a trader for awhile, but got tired of all the walking. Westside was a good place to settle down as any.
GID00001853	I deliver things and stuff for the people here. They give me caps to do it.
GID00001854	I talked to the cashier at Gomorrah into forwarding me some chips - I was convinced I was due for a hot streak.
GID00001855	It, uh, didn't go so well. The Omertas were nice and said they'd give me some time to pay them back.
GID00001856	They also said if they had to talk to me about my debt again, they wouldn't be nice the next time.
GID00001857	Of course. Which one?
GID00001858	Very well. What job did you need more information on?
GID00001859	Something has actually come up. A prospector recently came through here and spent a lot of caps on supplies.
GID00001860	Closer inspection of these caps has revealed them to be brand new. This is a problem.
GID00001861	The most likely source of these new caps is the old sarsaparilla bottling plant. Go there, locate the bottle cap press, and disable it.
GID00001862	Can do.
GID00001863	I want my debt with the Omertas paid off. And I want one of those severance package things. A big one.
GID00001864	My terms are the same as before. They pay off my debt to the Omertas, and I get a big fucking severance package.
GID00001865	I look after the only reasons anyone would want to spend any time here. I'm a pimp.
GID00001866	All Marco does is collect rent and take a small cut of my action. He sure as hell doesn't clean the rooms.
GID00001867	I look after the only reasons anyone would want to spend any time here. I'm a pimp.
GID00001868	Now that Marco's no longer around, I guess it's up to me to collect rent, too.
GID00001869	I'm called Sweetie because I'm the sweetest piece you'll find anywhere outside of the Strip. I could work in those casinos if I wanted.
GID00001870	I'm afraid I don't know much myself. Mr. House has got his own casino, the Lucky 38, but nobody goes in or out except his robots.
GID00001871	The other casinos follow Mr. House's rules, so I guess that makes him the leader of New Vegas. As far as I know, nobody's ever laid eyes on the guy.
GID00001872	I think that robot who pulled you out of the dirt belongs to Mr. House. If Mr. House is looking after you, that's gotta be a good thing, right?
GID00001873	There's always something interesting going on, but the biggest news has to be the coming dustup between the NCR and the Legion over the Dam.
GID00001874	The New California Republic's got the most power in Nevada. Money, troops, you name it.
GID00001875	They do what they can to keep things safe in the region, but if you ask me, they're trying to do too much. They're spread too thin.
GID00001876	We're the finest sniper outfit in the whole NCR. If you need a bullet put into a target's eye from 800 yards away, you call us.
GID00001877	Some of my team aren't without their share of scars, though, like Betsy and Sterling.
GID00001878	We're the finest sniper outfit in the whole NCR. If you need a bullet put into a target's eye from 800 yards away, you call us.
GID00001879	I worked in a casino in New Reno, and one of the pit bosses decided he didn't like me. Framed me over some caps, and I ended up in here.
GID00001880	Me? I ran with the toughest gang in the Hub. You've heard of the Hub, right? It's, uh, west of here, I think, back in California.
GID00001881	Nope, not for you. Rumor is you've been working against us, so the deal's off.
GID00001882	Yeah, we do. Here.
GID00001883	We're out at the moment. Come back later.
GID00001884	Dynamite. Lots and lots of dynamite. You should've seen the body parts flying everywhere.
GID00001885	[SUCCEEDED] I apologize for my rash action. I understand fighting and killing, not healing. I acted out of grief and loyalty.
GID00001886	[FAILED] It's obvious you know as little about medicine as I do. Spare me your excuses.
GID00001887	The mighty Caesar has bestowed upon you his Mark and guaranteed safe-conduct. If he wanted you dead, you would be dead already.
GID00001888	I am Gabban, of Caesar's Legion. I serve my master as the one of his Frumentarii.
GID00001889	We Frumentarii are soldiers of a different stripe, capable in battle, but skilled as infiltrators and agents as well.
GID00001890	They're family, you dig? They've always looked out for us, made sure we had something to eat and a place to crash.
GID00001891	Papa may look like a big angry bear, but he's a softie at heart. Regis is cool - scary, but cool. The rest are all pretty groovy, even little Jerry.
GID00001892	I'll spare you the history lesson - talk to Papa Khan if you want to hear that story.
GID00001893	Things have been rough for a while now, even with Jack working all the time and my runners making deliveries daily we're barely getting by.
GID00001894	Maybe this alliance with Caesar will help, but I don't know.
GID00001895	How many chips would you like?
GID00001896	All right.
GID00001897	Lot of bad blood between Super Mutants and humans. Goes back years. Some here still got the scars and memories.
GID00001898	Me, I don't really have a problem with the NCR. Set their sights a little too high sometimes, but they try. Legion, that's another story.
GID00001899	Your injuries aren't too severe. I can patch the scrapes and lacerations pretty easily.
GID00001900	Some of these lacerations are pretty severe and could get infected.
GID00001901	I'm surprised you're still standing. You've lost a lot of blood and should be stabilized immediately.
GID00001902	All right.
GID00001903	Is that so?
GID00001904	The Nightkin have varying degrees of mental instability due their addiction to Stealth Boy use. I've been trying to come up with a cure.
GID00001905	I'm currently investigating the local Nightstalker population since they seem to have developed a natural stealth field.
GID00001906	I've also gotten my hands on a working Stealth Boy Mark II prototype, but that experiment is riskier. I'd rather not pursue that research just yet.
GID00001907	Certainly did. Hubby and me had an old rad meter to help us tell the difference between what you could salvage and what'd kill you.
GID00001908	I kept a glowing container from REPCONN around here for years serving no better purpose than a nightlight. Damn thing wouldn't sell.
GID00001909	Then along comes the most peculiar-looking fellow, all decked out in a yellow radiation suit, of which he was proud all out of proportion.
GID00001910	The man outright asked if I had anything radioactive for sale - imagine that! But he paid handsome for that jar of goop.
GID00001911	Only saw him that once. He said something about heading over to Clark Field to put his suit through its paces. A strange one, he was...
GID00001912	You... you did? That's pretty amazing - I figured you'd need artillery to take her out.
GID00001913	I hate to say it, but as long as the Alpha Male is still alive, that pack isn't going anywhere, even with the Deathclaw Mother out of the picture.
GID00001914	What do you want to know?
GID00001915	The co-op is comprised of Westside locals and run by Clayton Etienne. They produce all of their own food and share in the profits of the co-op.
GID00001916	I'm with the Followers of the Apocalypse, and I help the locals in Westside grow crops. Unlike the NCR, the Followers don't expect anything back.
GID00001917	The soil and the hot, dry environment don't make it easy, but we get by all right.
GID00001918	We've even got our own food store, the Westside Co-op, complete with basic refrigeration.
GID00001919	I am Vulpes Inculta, of Caesar's Legion. I serve my master as the greatest of his Frumentarii.
GID00001920	We Frumentarii are soldiers of a different stripe, capable in battle, but skilled as infiltrators and agents as well.
GID00001921	Are you kidding me? Never felt better!
GID00001922	Are you kidding? The supplies in this are going to save lives. Thank you.
GID00001923	Shoot.
GID00001924	He's the best warrior in the Legion. A full Legionary by the time he was 12, he's never lost a battle.
GID00001925	Had the Legate been in command during the Battle of Hoover Dam, the Legion would've won. I have no doubt about that.
GID00001926	No, I do not require the "services" of a degenerate such as yourself.
GID00001927	There is a gambler, Martina Groesbeck, who has a knack for learning other people's secrets and passing that information along for a price.
GID00001928	The Omertas, who run Gomorrah, have become suspicious of Martina's frequent visits to their casino. Soon they'll pay her a visit of their own.
GID00001929	As I said before, Martina Groesback is a useful, if unwitting, source of information. The Omertas want her dead, while I need her alive.
GID00001930	For now, anyway. She'll need to lay low while the Omertas are scrambling to find out what happened.
GID00001931	They'll eventually send more men after her, but I'm sure I'll come up with a better solution to the problem by then.
GID00001932	Excellent. Had you simply killed them, the Omertas would've sent another group after Martina eventually.
GID00001933	You've saved me the trouble of coming up with a more permanent solution, and Martina is free to go about her business as usual. Well done.
GID00001934	I see. Was it ill fortune, or is Caesar's faith in you misplaced? Either way - it's done.
GID00001935	The mighty Caesar has bestowed upon you his Mark and guaranteed safe-conduct. If he wanted you dead, you would be dead already.
GID00001936	I'm Jane, one of Mr. House's girls. We keep him... entertained. We don't get many guests lately; perhaps we can entertain you as well.
GID00001937	The leader was a New Vegas-type, typical city boy. He had a bunch of Great Khans with him, probably hired guns.
GID00001938	The Great Khans normally stay in their own territory way up northwest, on account of them being enemies with the NCR.
GID00001939	Twice. Both times, I drank a lot of liquor and lost most of my caps at the card tables. In that order, now that I think about it.
GID00001940	If you ever get to New Vegas, be sure to visit Gomorrah. It's the best casino in the city. You won't regret it.
GID00001941	Word of advice - behave. Between the NCR military police and Mr. House's robots, you don't want to be causing trouble on the Strip.
GID00001942	I hunt geckos, mostly. The meat's pretty good and I can always find a buyer for the hides.
GID00001943	I also help keep the town clear of radscorpions and coyotes. Not many people live in Goodsprings, so wildlife is always creeping in.
GID00001944	That's great to hear, really great. I am Sheldon, from Vault 21, although here I go by my artistic name, "Michael Angelo."
GID00001945	So, what brings you here?
GID00001946	Ah, new to the hunt, are you? Well listen carefully, as ol' Festus don't like to repeat himself.
GID00001947	Select Sunset Sarsaparilla bottles will have special caps with blue stars on them. These caps are known as Sunset Sarsaparilla Stars.
GID00001948	Why are these stars there, and what do they mean? Nobody knows! Except maybe ol' Festus, hee hee.
GID00001949	Rustle up enough of them and you can win a prize! So get out there, and start drinking Sunset Sarsaparilla!
GID00001950	Oh, sorry. I thought everybody knew already. I'm a trader with the Crimson Caravan Company.
GID00001951	I'm, uh, staying in town for a bit.
GID00001952	Like I said, I'm not from Goodsprings. I'm a trader with the Crimson Caravan Company.
GID00001953	Mostly traders looking to buy Bighorner meat and hides. The traders are the main reason the general store manages to stay in business.
GID00001954	Most travelers heading south on in the I-15 just push on towards Primm unless they're in desperate need of supplies.
GID00001955	Used to be a Ranger... one of the first they sent out east, back before we took the Dam. Observation and reconnaissance.
GID00001956	We took the lay of the land, checked out the locals, and kept ourselves inconspicuous. Couple friends of mine were the first to scout the Dam.
GID00001957	That was back in '73, if I recall. Lot of those Rangers are dead now.
GID00001958	Vegas always chewed men up... it's just a little more literal, nowadays.
GID00001959	Well hey, the field's wide open, now that I'm gone. Probably lots of people looking to get in, once they hear I quit.
GID00001960	Guess not. I don't mean nothing by it.
GID00001961	You really want to talk to somebody, try 10 of Spades. He's always got plenty to say.
GID00001962	Me, I'm here to do my job. For now, that job is shootin' Fiends.
GID00001963	10 of Spades always had plenty to say, before he got himself killed. Me, I'm just here to do my job.
GID00001964	Name's Keith. You feeling lucky? I got games of chance, games of skill, games of you-name-it. Want to win a little cash?
GID00001965	Makes no difference to me. I'd be happy to see any one of them dead. Who will it be?
GID00001966	Some squatters decided to take space where they don't belong, over by the playground. We'd prefer to keep 'em off the streets and out of sight.
GID00001967	Maybe you could go and talk to them... convince them to see things our way.
GID00001968	Good work with those newcomers. I think you can handle more serious business... with more serious rewards.
GID00001969	There's a handful of greasers down in the sewers causing trouble. They ain't packing too much iron, but I'd like them dealt with all the same.
GID00001970	Good work with those newcomers. I think you can handle more serious business... with more serious rewards.
GID00001971	There's a handful of greasers down in the sewers causing trouble. They ain't packing too much iron, but I'd like them dealt with all the same.
GID00001972	You know, this time I may actually need a gun with a brain.
GID00001973	Talk to Mrs. Hostetler. She's near the Crimson Caravan. I think her daughter's making bad "friends," the kind that'll slit your throat in the dark.
GID00001974	All Gun Runner merchandise is constructed on-site.
GID00001975	That's not junk. That's other people's thoughts. People had to think to make them, and the thoughts got stuck inside.
GID00001976	I need other people's thoughts to fill my head when I'm not thinking myself. Otherwise it's... kind of empty.
GID00001977	Johnson Nash's my name. Husband to Ruby Nash. Lived in Primm going on eight years now, thick and thin.
GID00001978	I'm a trader primarily, for what it's worth with things like they are. I also run the local Mojave Express outpost.
GID00001979	It's about time one of you guys showed up - I've been waiting long enough. The NCR will probably give me a nice bounty for your corpse.
GID00001980	Huh - didn't know there were women Powder Gangers. Oh, well - the NCR will still give me a nice bounty for your corpse.
GID00001981	I'm Ruby Nash. Pleased to make your acquaintance.
GID00001982	My husband and I are Primm long-timers. He fancies himself a trader, and I know my way around a kitchen.
GID00001983	Maybe you are and maybe you aren't, but I don't give my help to enemies of the NCR. Maybe you can find a raider "medic" to fix you up.
GID00001984	Let me take a look. Really? That's it? You've got a few scrapes and a hangnail. Come back when you're really hurt.
GID00001985	You got to be kidding me. You're fine - this is just a ploy to get a free sucker, isn't it?
GID00001986	Let's see... Physically, you're fine. Emotionally... well, I'm not the right kind of doctor for that.
GID00001987	I don't see nothing wrong with you.
GID00001988	That's not the worst injury I've seen - hell, it's not even the worst this week. I think we can patch you up.
GID00001989	This doesn't look too bad. We'll have you good as new in no time.
GID00001990	That's not so bad. I'll have you looking good as new. I mean, what are the chances of me botching another routine procedure in the same day?
GID00001991	Don't look like nothing too serious. Lemme patch you up.
GID00001992	Unless you dipped that in cheese fondue, I'd say it's infected. Let me fix that up for you.
GID00001993	Sure. I can help you out.
GID00001994	Yeah, that's looking pretty bad. I think we can do something about it though - just a minute.
GID00001995	Damn, that's got to hurt. Okay, hold still, it's gonna get worse before it gets better.
GID00001996	Jesus, I don't think that's supposed to just dangle like that. And what the hell is that thing there?
GID00001997	It's gonna be expensive. Try not to speak. Just nod yes or no.
GID00001998	Holy God, what battlefield did you just crawl off of? I'm going to be honest, this is kind of out of my league, but I'll do what I can.
GID00001999	I wasn't going to say anything, but when you walked in here I thought you were a ghoul. We better get to work on this quick.
GID00002000	This? This is nothing. You should see some of the wounds I've seen paladins come back with.
GID00002001	That's not so bad. I should be able to treat you rather quickly.
GID00002002	By Steel, I haven't seen wounds like these since HELIOS. I've got to get you treated quickly.
GID00002003	I'm sorry, but is that supposed to be a joke? There's nothing wrong with you. I can tell just by looking.
GID00002004	Don't think because I'm a Ghoul, I'm stupid. You're fine.
GID00002005	Is this a trick question? I don't even see a scratch on you.
GID00002006	Injured... ha! This is just a nick. If you can't tough it out and you want to be fixed up it'll cost you 50 caps.
GID00002007	I'd hesitate to even call this a wound, but if you insist. 50 caps should cover my expenses.
GID00002008	Yeah, you could do with some work. It'll set you back 75 caps, but well worth it.
GID00002009	This is pretty bad, but I've seen worse. Still, it's going to cost 75 caps to get you back on your feet.
GID00002010	Yeah, you look almost as bad as I do. Of course, I'm supposed to look this way and you aren't. 100 caps will do it for my expenses.
GID00002011	Did you get the number of that Brahmin that trampled you? Sheesh! If you want me to stitch you back together, it'll be 100 caps.
GID00002012	I don't see anything wrong with you.
GID00002013	Sure, I could patch you up. Nothing too serious. I don't work for free though.
GID00002014	Sure, I could patch you up. Nothing too serious. I don't work for free though.
GID00002015	You're right. You do need a doctor. Lucky I happened along. But first let's discuss my fee...
GID00002016	You're not kidding. You're in bad shape, friend. I'd be happy to fix you up... for a reasonable fee.
GID00002017	I don't see anything wrong with you.
GID00002018	No, Legate Lanius is Caesar's second. The Legate replaced the Burned Man after the Legion's defeat at the Dam several years ago.
GID00002019	Legate Lanius has not chosen anyone to be his second yet. It would be an honor to be selected, though.
GID00002020	[FAILED] I know important people here in the Strip. Powerful people. You, uh, can't get anything out of me.
GID00002021	[SUCCEEDED] I am sorry, meant no offense. The billboards are not ready yet... Please, I need more time, more materials!
GID00002022	I don't have a mama or papa anymore. I see them sometimes when I take off my medicine, but they can't stay. I'm pretty used to being on my own.
GID00002023	The Burned Man was Caesar's advisor and general when the Legion was originally formed. The Burned Man led us to a disastrous defeat at the Dam.
GID00002024	On Caesar's orders, the Burned Man was covered in pitch by the Praetorian Guard, lit on fire, and cast into the Grand Canyon.
GID00002025	Caesar has forbidden us from ever speaking his true name again, and so we simply refer to him as the Burned Man.
GID00002026	Military operations are classified information. The brass is familiar with the situation at the NCRCF.
GID00002027	Military operations are classified information.
GID00002028	I have no idea. I just go and do what they tell me.
GID00002029	I would certainly hope that someone should handle it! Not that they tell me anything.
GID00002030	We'd be the last to know.
GID00002031	I hope they do, but I haven't heard nothing.
GID00002032	Your guess's as good as mine. Probably better.
GID00002033	There's a prison north of here? Well, don't go picking up any hitchhikers and you should be all right.
GID00002034	I might know something. But my memory ain't what it used to be. Sometimes it needs motivating.
GID00002035	Ain't that a coincidence! My mind's still hazy on the subject.
GID00002036	I wouldn't know anything about that, dear. You might ask Johnson.
GID00002037	I might know something. 'Bout 100 caps worth of something, let's say?
GID00002038	What a coincidence! I'd still like my 100 caps!
GID00002039	I wouldn't know anything about that, dear. You might ask Johnson.
GID00002040	Because spending myself to the edge of artistic oblivion for Mr. House sums up my existence since I had to leave Vault 21, that's why.
GID00002041	Legate Lanius will take Caesar's place at the head of the Legion. The Legate is a fine warrior, and the Legion will do well under his command.
GID00002042	The message? You know about that...?
GID00002043	There was some kind of message, but... I don't seem to remember it.
GID00002044	Yeah... that air! Smell it!
GID00002045	We don't talk about that. Next topic.
GID00002046	Most of my body is scarred all over, like a ghoul. Nobody around who'd want to screw that. No, I just run things.
GID00002047	I got my start at the Gomorrah, good money, but I saw how those Omertas hook girls on free Jet or Med-X - then start charging.
GID00002048	Slavery through a needle is what that is. I earn less out here, but I keep more.
GID00002049	They're tough sons of bitches, mean but not crazy - they'll leave you alone unless you've got something they want.
GID00002050	The Great Khans deal in illegal chems. There's a good chance that most chems you come across were made by Great Khans.
GID00002051	It's a two-player game, and the winner takes the whole pot. You build a "caravan" using the cards in your deck.
GID00002052	The goal is to create caravan bids that beat your opponent's bids, so there's more strategy than luck involved.
GID00002053	It's why you won't see Caravan in any casino - too slow-paced, and more importantly, no house edge.
GID00002054	Here, take this holotape - it goes into more specifics about the rules. You'll also need a deck, so take one of my spares.
GID00002055	So... you feel like playing a game?
GID00002056	Sure.
GID00002057	If they've proven hard to kill, yes. Whatever it takes to get the job done, even if means hiring help from outside the military.
GID00002058	This is where the NCR sent prisoners to "reform" through hard labor. I never saw much reforming around here, myself.
GID00002059	We've got the biggest, baddest fort in the wasteland. There's water and power, and if we need grub, we just go out and steal it.
GID00002060	I keep an eye on my buddy Eddie. Anybody messes with him and I scramble them real good.
GID00002061	Used to guard Eddie, but not anymore.
GID00002062	Where to begin? That they are weak, and we are strong? This much was known already.
GID00002063	But the depths of their moral sickness, their dissolution? Nipton serves as the perfect object lesson.
GID00002064	Where to begin? That you are weak, and we are strong? This much was known already.
GID00002065	But the depths of your moral sickness, your dissolution? Nipton serves as the perfect object lesson.
GID00002066	Keith! In the name of the NCR, I'm placing you under arrest for illicit gambling and the sale of unlicensed chems.
GID00002067	Keith! In the name of the NCR, I'm placing you under arrest for the sale of unlicensed chems.
GID00002068	Keith! In the name of the NCR, I'm placing you under arrest for illicit gambling.
GID00002069	Come quietly now, I don't want to have to hurt you.
GID00002070	You son of a bitch!
GID00002071	Let me take a look.
GID00002072	Nightkin suffer schizophrenia from the Stealth Boys they're always using. One of the reasons I settled Jacobstown was so they could be cured.
GID00002073	While they're in town, the Nightkin aren't allowed to have Stealth Boys so their craziness doesn't get worse.
GID00002074	Trouble is the Nightkin don't like being visible, either. They don't take being exposed too well.
GID00002075	Sometimes it seems like I spent the better portion of my youth in that old wreck of a building.
GID00002076	Me and my hubby, may the man rest in peace, used to scavenge there. If it weren't bolted down, you can bet we took it and sold it.
GID00002077	A lot of the scrap you see around here is from REPCONN, even my favorite chair.
GID00002078	You... you did? That's pretty amazing - I figured you'd need artillery to take him out.
GID00002079	I hate to say it, but as long as the Deathclaw Mother is still alive, that pack isn't going anywhere. She'll take another mate and keep laying eggs.
GID00002080	Where to begin? That you are weak, and we are strong? This much was known already.
GID00002081	But the depths of your moral sickness, your dissolution? Nipton serves as the perfect object lesson.
GID00002082	Where to begin? That they are weak, and we are strong? This much was known already.
GID00002083	But the depths of their moral sickness, their dissolution? Nipton serves as the perfect object lesson.
GID00002084	Lottery? You remember the lottery?
GID00002085	Goddamn you! I don't need to remember that!
GID00002086	My story's a long one, friend, and I can't say as it's all that interesting.
GID00002087	I'm glad to see you've given it some thought. Are you willing to go talk to them?
GID00002088	Thanks for doing this. Remember, we need their resources to help us in the upcoming battle. Do whatever it takes.
GID00002089	I hope you've returned with good news. Are they willing to help the NCR?
GID00002090	What's the word with the Boomers? Have you talked with them yet?
GID00002091	Baby, you stick with me, you won't have to work a day in your life. Don't fret about caps, you just sit there and look pretty for me.
GID00002092	The machine? Harmless, no matter what Trudy says. She thinks it's hiding something, but I think it's just a broken down relic with no place to be.
GID00002093	Sure. What did you want to know?
GID00002094	Going on six months, now. But I reckon we'll be moving out, soon enough. Can't talk about the details.
GID00002095	'Til then, we'll man the towers and keep an eye on the Fiends. We've had more than our share of trouble from their direction.
GID00002096	Whole things smells of Caesar to me. 'Course, that's just guesswork, but I'd still bet a few caps that he's stirring up the locals against us.
GID00002097	Simple. I'm going to make myself some easy money. I got a plan.
GID00002098	Once I get my caps from Dhatri, I'm going to head on over to Gomorrah and win big at cards.
GID00002099	There's not as many people playing at Gomorrah, so that means I've got better odds of winning big. I got this figured out.
GID00002100	A while, I guess. I don't keep too careful track of time.
GID00002101	I like to keep things simple. Just focus on now. That's why they made me a sniper.
GID00002102	You let your mind wander back a ways, and you lose sight of what's in front of your eyes. Good way to miss a mark.
GID00002103	Yes, he's an account manager for the Crimson Caravan Company. He works such long ours to provide for our daughter and me.
GID00002104	You should speak to him if you get the chance - he's always saying how badly understaffed they are.
GID00002105	Thanks. Let me know what you find out. Here's hoping she's okay.
GID00002106	Maybe you are and maybe you aren't, but I don't give my help to enemies of the NCR. Maybe you can find a raider "medic" to fix you up.
GID00002107	Hey, pipe down. We can't talk about that here, out in the open.
GID00002108	Oh, you mean you want a cure. Oh.
GID00002109	If you've seen half the things I've seen out in the Wasteland, I can't say I blame you. I might be able to help with that.
GID00002110	Well, then, take two shots of whiskey and call me in the morning. Heh heh, little doctor humor. Okay, let's have a look.
GID00002111	I can't say that's something I treat all the time, but I should have something to help you through it.
GID00002112	Sure. I can help you out.
GID00002113	I see. Spare me the details. Goddamn. She had the yellowest smile...
GID00002114	You did your part, so I'll do mine. Go ahead and root around up here if you want. I'm going to make a break for topside.
GID00002115	I'll be here. Just don't expect me to fend off a gang of Super Mutants while you're gone.
GID00002116	Okay. Just don't be gone long. I sunburn easily.
GID00002117	I'll sit tight.
GID00002118	Shoulda brought something to read...
GID00002119	Okay, boss. I'll just wait here, alone, while my heavily armed companion goes out of earshot. I'm sure nothing will happen.
GID00002120	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00002121	<bark!>
GID00002122	Sitting tight. And pretty.
GID00002123	All right, give a yell if there's trouble.
GID00002124	I'll hold up here, don't be long.
GID00002125	Don't go too far now, dearie!
GID00002126	Stay where grandma can see you!
GID00002127	Grandma will be right here if you need anything, pumpkin!
GID00002128	You better not be leaving me here.
GID00002129	Lot of the mutants here found out about Jacobstown because of Neil. Our isolation works against us sometimes.
GID00002130	In what currency would you like your payout? Non-caps currencies will have fractions paid out in caps.
GID00002131	I represent the Nightkin. Marcus may lead this town, but the Nightkin listen to what I have to say.
GID00002132	That doesn't mean I don't respect Marcus for what he's trying to do. However, he doesn't truly understand the difficulties of being a Nightkin.
GID00002133	Same as any civilized town - don't start any fights or steal anything, we'll treat you fair. Not a lot to ask.
GID00002134	Ranger Station Charlie. We're responsible for keeping the highway up through Novac civilized.
GID00002135	Tough, independent, and as ruthless as they come. They're holed up in Red Rock Canyon, and it's this station's job to keep an eye on them.
GID00002136	I... don't want to talk about it.
GID00002137	"For?" No, not exactly. It was a long time ago. Things are a lot different these days, and those days are way behind me.
GID00002138	Yes. Specializing in neuroscience, both human and canine. Of course, this lab is nothing compared to what I had when I was with the Enclave.
GID00002139	What can I get you?
GID00002140	Don't have any other place to go. I'd just end up back in another prison, or dead out in the wasteland.
GID00002141	Yet you failed, and you must pay.
GID00002142	Women are beneath notice, as Caesar has taught us. I'm only allowing you to speak to me because you are Caesar's guest.
GID00002143	I may yet, if Caesar commands it.
GID00002144	I am one of Caesar's Frumentarii, an infiltrator, a spy. You were not difficult to track.
GID00002145	The Legion is civilization reborn. Our culture is based on virtues such as martial excellence, loyalty, and justice.
GID00002146	But you'll learn all there is to know in due time. Legatus Lanius, Monster of the East, will soon arrive to command Caesar's troops in battle.
GID00002147	The Dam will fall, and the rest of the Profligate west will soon follow.
GID00002148	The way I heard it, the Brotherhood of Steel ran the place before the NCR took it away from them. I'm not sure who started shooting first.
GID00002149	But, when it was over, the Brotherhood, with all their fancy armor and weapons, was on the run. Nobody's heard from them since.
GID00002150	Most of the time, I'm Doctor Henry's research assistant. We're looking into ways to cure the, uh...
GID00002151	I'm also handy with tools, and once in awhile I venture down into the valley to trade Big Horner hides and meat for supplies.
GID00002152	They moved into the quarry after the Powder Gangers came through and made off with most of our dynamite.
GID00002153	We shut the quarry down while we waited for the NCR to get us some more blasting sticks, but now the Deathclaws have shown up.
GID00002154	The NCR's a no-show, and my men and I have got nothing to do but sit on our asses all day. It's damn frustrating.
GID00002155	Freedom? Thank God Frank thinks we're enslaved.
GID00002156	Now we can actually start fresh. Thank you for helping us.
GID00002157	Freedom? I don't know where we'll get a new start, but any place is better than rotting with the legion or Frank.
GID00002158	The Legion is civilization reborn. Our culture is based on virtues such as martial excellence, loyalty, and justice.
GID00002159	But you'll learn all there is to know in due time. Legatus Lanius, Monster of the East, will soon arrive to command Caesar's troops in battle.
GID00002160	The Dam will fall, and the rest of the Profligate west will soon follow.
GID00002161	These will be a big help, thanks.
GID00002162	I might have some answers for you. What did you want to know?
GID00002163	I don't go looking for fights with them, but they don't have the best interests of people in mind. Certainly not locals.
GID00002164	The bottom line for NCR is productivity and growth. Politicians back in Shady Sands are completely detached from the people actually living here.
GID00002165	Oh, so you have heard of me. Yeah, that's right. I was the big draw at the Shark Club, people used to pay hundreds of caps to see me.
GID00002166	What lottery? The lottery, that's what lottery! Are you stupid?
GID00002167	Only lottery that matters! Oh my God smell that air!
GID00002168	I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand that. Could you repeat it?
GID00002169	I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand that. Could you repeat it?
GID00002170	While Sunset Sarsaparilla is perfectly safe, a recent independent study - whose validity is currently being challenged - revealed the following:
GID00002171	Excessive ingestion of sarsaparilla can lead to deleterious effects including, but not limited to:
GID00002172	kidney damage,
GID00002173	nausea,
GID00002174	digital numbness,
GID00002175	anxiety,
GID00002176	loss of visual acuity,
GID00002177	dizziness,
GID00002178	occasional nosebleeds,
GID00002179	joint inflammation,
GID00002180	tooth decay,
GID00002181	sore throat,
GID00002182	bronchitis,
GID00002183	organ rupture,
GID00002184	and halitosis.
GID00002185	Note that you'd have to drink a heap of Sunset Sarsaparilla to match the quantities used in the study. How much, you ask?
GID00002186	A lot. A whole helluva lot. In fact, you'd have to get full as a tick on Sunset Sarsaparilla to even come close.
GID00002187	Anyway, thanks for stopping by, partner! And keep drinking Sunset Sarsaparilla!
GID00002188	This kiosk was specially constructed around me to deter theft and assault.
GID00002189	See, I thought the bounty hunting trade would be easy money, but it turns out it's hard work. So screw it.
GID00002190	Also - I ran into this mark who was a little too tough for me. I mean, I could've taken him.
GID00002191	But with this guy, it might have cost me some bad burns or an ass-rape. I'm all for risking my life, but I'm a little sensitive about my asshole.
GID00002192	Yeah, look... he's not my real father. He just looked after me, for a while.
GID00002193	It's a long story. And I'd get tired of talking before it was through.
GID00002194	It's like I told you. Dhatri's not my real father. He just looked after me for a while.
GID00002195	This is what I been waiting to see! A big bad Khan bringing in the medicine! How about you toss some psycho my way?
GID00002196	What the fuck are you doing here? You got some kind of fucking death wish, asshole?
GID00002197	I wasn't expecting a resupply so soon, so you have anything from Red Rock Canyon to sell me?
GID00002198	NCR? Here? Not for long.
GID00002199	How the hell did you get in here? Where the fuck are my guards?
GID00002200	Take down this password, it'll get you into the Overseer's area upstairs I think.
GID00002201	Thanks for the help. We'll find our own way out.
GID00002202	Thanks for the help. We'll find our own way out.
GID00002203	Thanks for the help. We'll find our own way out.
GID00002204	Thanks for the help. We'll find our own way out.
GID00002205	Thanks for the assistance taking out Motor-Runner. I'll be heading back to McCarran. I'll put in a good word for you.
GID00002206	There's usually a gun merchant hanging around topside. I'm sure she'll take care of you.
GID00002207	Oh, I don't sell things, mister. I sell thoughts.
GID00002208	Oh, I don't sell things, ma'am. I sell thoughts.
GID00002209	Great! What do you want me to think about? I can think about You, Here... or Everywhere. What do you want?
GID00002210	Sure, I could do some more thinking. What should I do my thinking about this time?
GID00002211	That's all right, mister. You will someday.
GID00002212	That's all right, ma'am. You will someday.
GID00002213	Sorry, sir. All that thinking has made my head hurt. I don't think I'll be doing any thinking for a long time.
GID00002214	Sorry, ma'am. All that thinking has made my head hurt. I don't think I'll be doing any thinking for a long time.
GID00002215	Let me see what I can do.
GID00002216	My mother taught me never to say something 'less it was nice. So I don't have nothing to say about Primm, for the time being at least.
GID00002217	It's a sad state of affairs. Discuss it with Mr. Nash if you care to. Just makes me want to cry.
GID00002218	Thanks to you, Primm's on the way back up. With folks watching over us, I think the raiders will keep their distance.
GID00002219	[SUCCEEDED] Okay, I admit it. They've been collecting dust since before I got here. You can have them dirt cheap.
GID00002220	What? What happened?
GID00002221	I'm afraid to ask.
GID00002222	Dobson's my name. I'm an NCR Ranger, operating out of Camp McCarran north of here. Redding man by birth, though.
GID00002223	It'll be easy enough to purge all rads from your system.
GID00002224	Yeah, I was there. I was Captain Dhatri, then. That whole situation was a mess and could easily have been avoided with good intel.
GID00002225	The major in charge at the time made a bad call - he thought Bitter Springs was full of Great Khan raiders, so we surrounded the place.
GID00002226	By the time any of us realized there were civilians down there - women and children - the shooting had already started.
GID00002227	The major froze up at the news, and we couldn't get another word out of him. I took over and salvaged the situation as best I could.
GID00002228	For my effort, I was promoted to major. Not quite the way I'd have wanted it.
GID00002229	A great warrior. When he was but a recruit, I watched him kill ten men in the arena with his bare hands.
GID00002230	He doesn't feel pain and he never, ever shows mercy. If all Legionaries were like him, the Legion would be invincible.
GID00002231	To call Lanius ferocious would be an understatement. In battle, he seizes the enemy in his jaws and will not let go.
GID00002232	He thinks nothing of suffering losses, so long as the enemy suffers more. Though unsubtle, he is not dim. He detects traps, and sets his own.
GID00002233	Be glad you will not have to face his judgment... if you are true to Caesar.
GID00002234	Lanius served Caesar well, as his greatest battlefield commander.
GID00002235	With Lanius at the head of the Legion, however, I doubt he'll have much use for my services. He prefers... direct methods.
GID00002236	Well, I'll give you a hint - they used to just call me Gibson. I hope you can figure out the rest.
GID00002237	I don't mind, to be honest. Living long is a real accomplishment these days. Remains to be seen if I end up dying peaceful in my bed.
GID00002238	Prospectors looking for salvage, usually. They always run when they see the mutants.
GID00002239	The Great Khans come this way once in awhile, but they keep their distance. I think they're mostly keeping an eye on us.
GID00002240	This is Sloan, a camp for us quarry workers. The actual quarry, Quarry Junction, is up the road north of here. The whole thing is an NCR operation.
GID00002241	We make cement for the NCR using the limestone we dig out with dynamite and draglines. Dirty work, but the pay's good.
GID00002242	Wish we got paid in caps, though. Not a lot of merchants like taking NCR paper money.
GID00002243	Torres must be getting desperate if she's accepting help on this one. I'll tell you what I told her.
GID00002244	My records show that Initiate Stanton was the last to check it out, but checked it back in a day later.
GID00002245	You a merc? Then I guess you'd want to talk to my, uh... father. Major Dhatri. He's our CO.
GID00002246	You really ought to avoid using those kinds of chems, but I'll see what I can do.
GID00002247	We know they supply the Fiends with illegal chems, but they never stick around in NCR territory for long. They know the land, and move quick.
GID00002248	There's talk from time to time about taking out their base at Red Rock Canyon, but nothing ever comes of it. The Great Khans are tough fighters.
GID00002249	If we ever did go up against them on their home turf, we'd win, but casualties would be high.
GID00002250	That beat up old thing? What do you want to know?
GID00002251	Well, I was thinking I might set this bunker up as a safehouse. Between the remote location and the dust storms, I figured it was ideal.
GID00002252	'Course, seems a lot less remote since you showed up. Plus I haven't been able to get my radio working, and a safehouse's no good without one.
GID00002253	I reckon I'll stick around awhile, patrol for troublemakers, see if I can get that radio working.
GID00002254	Well, I thought I might set up a safehouse in one of the bunkers here. Between the remote location and the dust storms, I figured it was ideal.
GID00002255	'Course, seems a lot less remote since you showed up. Plus I haven't been able to get my radio working, and a safehouse's no good without one.
GID00002256	I reckon I'll stick around awhile, patrol for troublemakers, see if I can get that radio working.
GID00002257	The Stealth Boys we use have cumulative, adverse effects on our minds. Jacobstown was supposed to be a sanctuary, a place to find a cure.
GID00002258	Instead, we wait and wait. I'm sick of waiting.
GID00002259	The Stealth Boys we use have cumulative, adverse effects on our minds. But, thanks to you, it seems a cure is on the way at last.
GID00002260	My grandfather opened up this shop. Took over from him when the Fiends killed him.
GID00002261	Maybe. What do you want to know?
GID00002262	Thank you. I change names and jobs every decade or so, just to keep things interesting. I picked "Calamity" this time because it sounded nice.
GID00002263	I've never really done much science stuff until now. I'm pretty good at it, or so Doctor Henry tells me.
GID00002264	I have reserved a small part of my supplies for sale. The profits go directly to the purchase of additional supplies to help the less fortunate.
GID00002265	I prefer the solitude, and having a bunch of Super Mutants around tends to keep things safe and quiet.
GID00002266	Adoptive father, yes. I was very proud when he made First Recon. I know that every time I send them out, I could be sending him to his death.
GID00002267	But, if it's not me, it'll be somebody else. At least this way I get one more chance to see him.
GID00002268	I was. I thought I'd accepted the fact that I could be the one ordering him to his death, but it's been more difficult than I thought.
GID00002269	Excuse me, but I'd rather not speak of this.
GID00002270	I've been there once, and I don't recommend it. It's just a way to burn through a month's pay in five minutes.
GID00002271	I've seen a lot of folks come through here thinking they'll have the easy life once they get there. It never happens.
GID00002272	It's a tradition in the Praetorians to specialize in unarmed combat because weapons can break or jam when needed most.
GID00002273	However, our unarmed techniques favor offense over defense. We can charge the enemy and flatten him with our first strike before he can react.
GID00002274	You have a poor reputation in the Legion. It wouldn't be acceptable for me to teach you anything right now.
GID00002275	[FAILED] I've watched you move, and I can tell you simply don't have the skill to learn the technique.
GID00002276	[SUCCEEDED] Of course. This will take some time, and I'm not a forgiving teacher.
GID00002277	Yet you failed, and you must pay.
GID00002278	It's not something we like to speak of. The Burned Man was our greatest warrior, even greater than Legate Lanius, but he failed Caesar at the Dam.
GID00002279	He's been dead for several years now, but the rumor is that Caesar has scouts out looking for him all the same. The Burned Man was a very tough man.
GID00002280	Ask someone else, woman.
GID00002281	Ah, yes - we are forbidden from speaking his true name. He was a shaman of some kind before he met Caesar, a holy man from out of the Utah.
GID00002282	The Burned Man proved dangerous, unpredictable, and impossible to kill. He helped Caesar form the Legion but almost led it to destruction.
GID00002283	Not a whole gang or anything - just two, maybe three. I was a caravan guard, so I know how to handle a gun pretty well.
GID00002284	I handle communications for Camp Forlorn Hope, compiling reports I've received from the Rangers at Camp Golf as well as the brass at McCarran.
GID00002285	Unofficially, I'm also in charge of radio security. No one else seems to take it as seriously as I do.
GID00002286	As are all crimes. If you feel strongly about it, attack us, and soon you won't feel a thing.
GID00002287	So you've said.
GID00002288	So you've said.
GID00002289	Thank you, this will keep us well-stocked for a good long while.
GID00002290	I am Cursor Lucullus, and my orders are to escort you to the Legion's camp at Fortification Hill. Are you ready to go?
GID00002291	Keeping watch on the Great Khans mostly. They usually stick around Red Rock Canyon, but at least one large group left recently.
GID00002292	We called it in, but haven't heard anything about any Great Khan incidents. Whatever they're doing, they're keeping a low profile.
GID00002293	Oh, this old thing? Why, thanks, friend. This here guitar is just about the only thing my daddy left me.
GID00002294	All quiet at the moment. Ranger Beaumont is in charge here, but he's off leading a patrol.
GID00002295	It was quiet until those rockets blasted off over our heads.
GID00002296	There was a hell of a boom over at REPCONN. Looks like the ghouls had some sort of accident with their rockets.
GID00002297	I operate the radio and call it in if we see any Great Khans moving out in large groups from Red Rock Canyon.
GID00002298	New in town, pardner? Well, let ol' Festus give you the lay of the land.
GID00002299	If you're here to redeem your Sunset Sarsaparilla Stars, dump 'em into the slot in the barrel below and I'll count 'em up.
GID00002300	If you don't know what Sunset Sarsaparilla Stars are and think ol' Festus is just shooting his mouth off, say "Star Info".
GID00002301	If you're here to challenge ol' Festus to a game of Lucky Horseshoes, say "I feel lucky".
GID00002302	Lastly, if you're here about the health advisory that aired on channel 6 recently, say "Silly Ol' Advisory."
GID00002303	No! Queenie! Hahahaha! I'm going to burn the world for you, Queenie!
GID00002304	You want to help us out? What makes you think we want you around here, huh?
GID00002305	Hsu sent you? This was my mission!
GID00002306	He sent you? Why?
GID00002307	[SUCCEEDED] Bzzzt... Law Enforcement Protocols reinstated, pardner. Initializing use of force authorization... authorization found. Yee-haw!
GID00002308	[FAILED] Aw, shucks, SYSTEM RUNTIME ERROR! Unable to initialize Law Enforcement Protocols, pardner!
GID00002309	You like it any better if I tell you to fuck off?
GID00002310	Thinking hurts you, too? Aw, I wish I could let you have the one on my head but I can't. It hurts real bad when I don't wear it.
GID00002311	Have a look.
GID00002312	You bet.
GID00002313	You done everything you could, youngster. It's over for Primm. Ain't nothing to be done about it.
GID00002314	Well I guess you're gonna have to find us a new lawman.
GID00002315	I suggest talking to those NCR troopers across the bridge. I also overheard the Powder Gangsters talking about some ex-sheriff on lockdown there.
GID00002316	Right now Beagle is the closest Primm's got to any organized law, but he's still stuck up in Bison Steve.
GID00002317	First thing I'd say his get his sorry butt outta there.
GID00002318	Your guess is good as mine. You might luck upon someone who's a natural-born sheriff.
GID00002319	I heard of one fella what got himself locked in that NCR jailhouse up I-15. Maybe that ain't the best credential, but a sheriff's a sheriff.
GID00002320	I imagine the NCR would be able to bring some law to the town, too. But from what I seen they barely got the firepower to protect themselves.
GID00002321	With the NCR driven off? I figure our only hope'd be for someone like you to find us someone who's crazy or dimwitted enough to take the job.
GID00002322	With Meyers dead and his deputies gone, Primm's only hope is to accept NCR rule. If you run across one of their patrols, tell 'em so.
GID00002323	I've been drinking this irradiated shit and... I can't do it. I just throw it up now. I need purified water... please...
GID00002324	Yes, that's the stuff. And the container's shielding must be intact, or you'd be dead by now.
GID00002325	You already brought me the thrust control modules, so all that's needed now is three boxes of Sugar Bombs.
GID00002326	Yes, that's the stuff. And the container's shielding must be intact, or you'd be dead by now.
GID00002327	Now all I need is the thrust control modules and three boxes of Sugar Bombs.
GID00002328	Yes, that's the stuff. And the container's shielding must be intact, or you'd be dead by now.
GID00002329	Yes, that's the stuff. And the container's shielding must be intact, or you'd be dead by now.
GID00002330	Now all I need is the thrust control modules.
GID00002331	Good. I'll make it worth your while. And one more thing. We shouldn't speak again. Not until it's over.
GID00002332	No one in town knows that I know what happened to my wife. Best they never know. Or the Legion will be after me next.
GID00002333	I just know what I've heard. There's supposed to be some ghouls that went in a while back.
GID00002334	Every so often there'll be a commotion from that direction - explosions and such.
GID00002335	Indeed you did. And they seem to be in excellent condition.
GID00002336	You already found the igniting agent, so all I need now is three boxes of Sugar Bombs.
GID00002337	Indeed you did. And they seem to be in excellent condition.
GID00002338	I still need the igniting agent, of course. And three boxes of Sugar Bombs.
GID00002339	Indeed you did. And they seem to be in excellent condition.
GID00002340	Indeed you did. And they seem to be in excellent condition.
GID00002341	All I need now is the igniting agent we discussed earlier.
GID00002342	Indeed you did. And they seem to be in excellent condition.
GID00002343	All I need now is the igniting agent we discussed earlier.
GID00002344	Sure thing. Have a look.
GID00002345	Praise the creator! And bless you, wanderer! The way is clear. I will lead my flock through the basement to the sacred site!
GID00002346	I hope you will come find us there, wanderer! There is much to be done.
GID00002347	I understand. I know you will fulfill your promise.
GID00002348	And they've been shooting them down like animals, haven't they?
GID00002349	Those ghouls were members of my flock, even after the madness consumed their minds. We never let them wander free.
GID00002350	We kept them safe on the first floor. We kept them contained. The demons must have let them out, somehow...
GID00002351	And now they are lost forever, denied the salvation and healing glow of the Far Beyond...
GID00002352	Please, wanderer, bear in mind that every feral ghoul you spare now is one that we can save later.
GID00002353	Once the way is clear, our feral brothers and sisters will accompany us on the Great Journey. If there are any left...
GID00002354	I am Jason Bright, the prophet of the Great Journey. All the ghouls you see here are members of my flock.
GID00002355	An auspicious name, don't you think? It was mine before I became as I am now. Before the Great War, even.
GID00002356	Truly does the creator author a destiny for each and every one of us...
GID00002357	We wish to escape the barbarity of the wasteland, especially the violence and bigotry of its human inhabitants.
GID00002358	The creator has promised to my flock a new land: a place of safety and healing... a paradise in the Far Beyond.
GID00002359	Preparations for the Great Journey were nearly complete when the demons appeared.
GID00002360	The means by which the Great Journey is to be accomplished are an article of faith, not to be discussed with outsiders.
GID00002361	Yes. The rockets will convey us to our promised land in the Far Beyond. Vision upon vision has confirmed it.
GID00002362	I understand your concerns, friend, and I thank you for voicing them. But the creator's will for us has been made manifest.
GID00002363	I understand your concerns, friend, and I thank you for voicing them. But the creator's will for us has been made manifest.
GID00002364	We've been here for a few years, just looking for a place we can call our own.
GID00002365	Life's harsh, but still, it beats the hell out of the desert. We've got numbers, we've got food, and we've got trade. That's progress, stranger.
GID00002366	See that you do.
GID00002367	I saved your life so I kinda feel responsible for you is all.
GID00002368	Heh, well of course not. We just wouldn't want anything to happen to you is all.
GID00002369	Keep your nose to the ground, stranger, that's what. Mind your own business and let us mind our own, are we clear?
GID00002370	If you've got a mind to loot the old H&H Tools factory, don't even bother. That place is sealed tighter than a Radscorpion's bunghole.
GID00002371	Every salvager who tries gets blown up, flattened, or gutted by traps. Then he starts to stink up the town and we're the ones to clean up the mess.
GID00002372	That's right, the H&H Tools factory on the main drag. It's been sealed for ages, and it's lousy with traps. Still, might be something valuable to you.
GID00002373	I wish I could say I was surprised. But that is what we've come to expect from your kind.
GID00002374	Normally, it's what I'd expect from you. But it was the creator who brought you here today.
GID00002375	Bzzzt... Law Enforcement Protocols reinstated, pardner. Initializing use of force authorization... authorization found. Yee-haw!
GID00002376	Aw, shucks, SYSTEM RUNTIME ERROR! Unable to initialize Law Enforcement Protocols, pardner!
GID00002377	Never been there since the NCR's got troops all over it. Must be pretty important.
GID00002378	Really? Unbelievable, man! I knew that wasn't gonna be easy.
GID00002379	But I had a good feeling about you. You look like you been through a lot.
GID00002380	Coincidentally, I'm also looking for her. I've got a business offer she'd be interested in.
GID00002381	I believe Cass frequents the Mojave Outpost, far south of here, near the California border.
GID00002382	Everything you see is funded by the Followers of the Apocalypse. We rely a lot on charity to provide low-cost medical services to the less fortunate.
GID00002383	We're part scout, part commando, part sheriff. The training is brutal, and I'd say eight out of ten recruits washes out before the end.
GID00002384	Before you get your Ranger badge, you've got to prove you can be quieter than a shadow and more ferocious than a Deathclaw.
GID00002385	Best of the best, that's all there is to it. Really nothing more to say than that.
GID00002386	Well, when there's trouble regular NCR troops can't handle, they send in a Ranger. Problem solved.
GID00002387	We're also responsible for keeping the borders of the NCR secure, scouting out threats, that sort of thing.
GID00002388	Shoot.
GID00002389	You'll be meeting face-to-face with the mighty Caesar himself, founder of the Legion, conquerer of 86 tribes.
GID00002390	To my knowledge, this is the first time Caesar has ever summoned one of the Dissolute to see him. Not even tribal chieftains receive this honor.
GID00002391	You'll be meeting face-to-face with the mighty Caesar himself, founder of the Legion, conquerer of 86 tribes.
GID00002392	To my knowledge, this is the first time Caesar has ever summoned one of the Dissolute to see him. That it'd be a woman is even more surprising.
GID00002393	Same old shit that's been going on for years. The NCR and Legion are still fighting over Hoover Dam for some reason.
GID00002394	I've run with some tough gangs, but I gotta admit they all got nothing on the Legion. I hear they stick you up on poles and it takes awhile to die.
GID00002395	I ain't saying I'm afraid of them or nothing, but I'll be staying out of their way.
GID00002396	"New" California Republic - nothing new about it. Just a bunch of people with money and power pushing everyone else around.
GID00002397	They've got troops all over the Mojave, but it's a big desert so it's pretty easy to avoid them if you want.
GID00002398	The fact that you're still on your feet is... surprising.
GID00002399	Life can be pretty rough sometimes.
GID00002400	I've seen worse.
GID00002401	I'll answer if I can.
GID00002402	Benny oversees the business, sure, but I run the Tops day to day. I'm his right-hand guy, you dig?
GID00002403	Yeah, well, that's the way it used to be. Now that Benny's gone, it's just me in charge.
GID00002404	Mr. House is out of the picture and you have the Platinum Chip? Wonderful! Let's go!
GID00002405	We'll see about that.
GID00002406	I'd be more than happy to have you. Heck, I'll hire anybody with a pair of legs and at least one good eye at this point.
GID00002407	There'd be a lot of money in it for you if you can get him back to me safe.
GID00002408	And if he ain't, you can bet I'll pay for the names of the sons of bitches responsible.
GID00002409	[SUCCEEDED] I should've known that Mr. House wouldn't have sent just anybody. Anything I might I offer to, well, encourage discretion?
GID00002410	[SUCCEEDED] You've made your point. What would it take to... convince you to keep silent until I manage to finish Mr. House's requests?
GID00002411	Name's Crandon, stranger. I keep an eye out for trouble around here.
GID00002412	Uh, you know, just filling up water and stuff.
GID00002413	[SUCCEEDED] I guess that'll do.
GID00002414	I swore not to say a word to no one, but an NCR deserter passed through some days ago and traded for supplies.
GID00002415	According to him, the NCR's decided enough's enough and's going to send in a mess of troops to take back the prison any day now.
GID00002416	[FAILED] Then I guess you won't be knowing more, eh? But you know where to find me, should you change your mind.
GID00002417	[SUCCEEDED] Hold on there! With everything you already done for this town, I'd feel ungrateful as hell if I let you risk yourself for no good reason!
GID00002418	He made me swear not to say a word to no one, but an NCR deserter passed through some days ago and traded for supplies.
GID00002419	According to him, the NCR's decided enough's enough and's going to send in a mess of troops to take back the prison any day now.
GID00002420	[SUCCEEDED] No need to get upset, youngster! We're all friends here!
GID00002421	I swore not to say a word to no one, but an NCR deserter passed through some days ago and traded for supplies.
GID00002422	According to him, the NCR's decided enough's enough and's going to send in a mess of troops to take back the prison any day now.
GID00002423	[FAILED] Sorry, youngster. I'm a trader, and if something's got value, I can't give it away for nothing.
GID00002424	Every night around midnight Alice and I'll wake up to some crazy hollering and gun shots. You'd think the world was ending all over again.
GID00002425	But it's just one animal each night. They don't take it or carve it up or nothing. Just leave it there, all full of holes.
GID00002426	Well, it's the strangest thing. Last time it happened I could swear I heard someone cry out for help. Sounded like a big fella.
GID00002427	But when we finally got up the gumption to go look outside all we found was our cattle. And I know what they sound like when they get upset.
GID00002428	I can't imagine what went on. Dusty can probably tell you more about it.
GID00002429	Believe me. When I heard the news, my first thought was, I owe somebody. Big. I figured Boone would come around after a while.
GID00002430	But he hasn't. And I'm starting to think that if he doesn't find her that things will never go back to the way they were.
GID00002431	Man, everybody. That girl didn't have one friend in this whole town. She didn't want any.
GID00002432	She wanted to sit in her room all day and make herself miserable. And she went out of her way to be rude.
GID00002433	She upset a lot of people. You wouldn't have liked her, either.
GID00002434	Uh... no. No. They're gonna think I'm having trouble letting go. They're good soldiers. I don't give them enough credit.
GID00002435	Right now? A whole lot of sitting on my keister and counting cracks in the ceiling. I wouldn't wish it on anybody.
GID00002436	On better days I help keep the peace. Boone and Vargas watch the road, I watch the town. Tell myself I'm doing some good.
GID00002437	How should I put it? I guess you could say she was kinda like a cactus flower. Real pretty to look at, but there was just no getting close to her.
GID00002438	She never did take to living here. She liked the big lights and fast living of New Vegas.
GID00002439	I got the feeling she was trying to get Boone to leave with her, but I guess she got tired of waiting.
GID00002440	Carla was a knockout. Whenever Boone walked around with her, he always had this funny grin on his face like he couldn't believe his luck.
GID00002441	I know we couldn't.
GID00002442	That wasn't the only reason she stuck out, though. That girl never minced words.
GID00002443	If she'd had better food or hospitality, she'd let you hear it. Trouble was, she usually had.
GID00002444	I don't think she meant it. She really was a sweet girl.
GID00002445	I think she just wanted to remind herself that there are still nicer places in this world than Novac. Who could blame her for that?
GID00002446	Boone. That's that sniper fella, works in the dinosaur, right? I only met them but once or twice.
GID00002447	They seemed real happy together. I really oughtta to get to know them better. They're probably nice folk.
GID00002448	Well, to be honest with you, I don't really know them two as well as I might.
GID00002449	I remember she had an edge about her, like she'd rather be someplace else. This kind of life ain't for everyone, that's for darn sure.
GID00002450	Can't say we spoke much. Boone did most of the buying for them. She was in the store once, but she didn't stay long.
GID00002451	Had a look on her face like she'd smelled something sour. But far as I can remember, the gift shop smelled fine. Well... fine as it always does.
GID00002452	If it's just the same to you, I think I'll stay in town. I feel safer that way.
GID00002453	Hey, I'm sorry, but I've gotta turn around. Leg's giving me some trouble.
GID00002454	Maybe some other time. I'm not really in the mood for a hike.
GID00002455	Nothing that wouldn't be wrong with any man who loses a wife, I suppose. Poor dear.
GID00002456	I know he thinks she was kidnapped, but I'm not so sure she didn't just run off on her own.
GID00002457	You could tell she was thinking about it ever since they arrived.
GID00002458	Had his wife taken. I don't think he'll ever be the same as he was. Damn shame.
GID00002459	I told the Rangers up at the station to keep an eye out, but there's just too much ground out there for them to cover.
GID00002460	I've got your back.
GID00002461	Right behind you, boss.
GID00002462	Lead the way.
GID00002463	Aw, just when the standing around was getting exciting.
GID00002464	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00002465	<bark!>
GID00002466	Let's hit the road.
GID00002467	Let's roll out, then.
GID00002468	All right, dearie, let's go.
GID00002469	Yeah, who am I kidding? It's funny, you get stuck in your room for a few weeks, you start to worry the world's gonna fall apart without you.
GID00002470	Those guys are fine. They don't need me looking over their shoulders.
GID00002471	I have glimpsed it only in visions, wanderer, but what I have seen is truly miraculous.
GID00002472	It is a place of light and healing, and I know in my soul that my flock will be safe there.
GID00002473	Your pranks won't work on me, smoothskin. They won't work on Jason, either.
GID00002474	Stop wasting my time, smoothskin. Go waste Jason's.
GID00002475	You're referring to Chris. I doubt you had much luck if you tried telling him that he's human.
GID00002476	We had the same discussions when he first appeared, and the same lack of success. He believes he is one of us.
GID00002477	Soon enough we realized that Chris was a gift from the creator. He is integral to the success of the Great Journey.
GID00002478	After all that you have done for us, I suppose you deserve to know everything...
GID00002479	When Chris came to us, we tried to convince him that he was human. But this only angered him. He seemed... lost.
GID00002480	We decided to let him stay with us for a few days, over the course of which we learned that his technical skills far surpassed our own.
GID00002481	It became clear that the creator had sent him to us, to ensure the success of the Great Journey.
GID00002482	Equally clear was that Chris should labor in blessed ignorance of his humanity, and his inability to make the journey himself.
GID00002483	It is no coincidence that two humans have been vital to the success of the Great Journey.
GID00002484	It is my belief that the creator sent you and Chris to expiate the sins of your kind against mine. You are redeemers both.
GID00002485	Such is the creator's will. Vision upon vision has shown me that, were Chris to accompany us, he would die in minutes.
GID00002486	The radiation around the launch pad alone would kill Chris in minutes. The radioactivity of the Far Beyond is much stronger.
GID00002487	Oh. Well, it's a big hotel. You should talk to Marjorie - she's in charge and she can probably help you find anyone you might need.
GID00002488	She usually works at the front of the Gourmand. She likes to see how people respond to it.
GID00002489	You can get to the Gourmand from the lobby here - it's a big set of double doors on the first floor on the eastern side. Can't miss it.
GID00002490	A man? Well then this... well this can't be. Two disappearances in my hotel? What will people say?
GID00002491	I'm going to have a word with my staff about security on the premises.
GID00002492	Whether these people are found or not, our guests simply must feel safe in their own rooms.
GID00002493	Jason is the prophet. The only reason you're up here is because he wants to talk to you.
GID00002494	I guess he had visions that a smoothskin would stop by.
GID00002495	This is a null line that no one will ever see.
GID00002496	Yes! This is going to be fun!
GID00002497	I'm unlocking the East Power Plant. Hit the manual switch, then go topside and deal with the Legion and NCR.
GID00002498	Right, who wants a vast army of mechanical servants to savage your enemy? Why make it easy?
GID00002499	I'm setting the generators to blow, just like you asked. Hit the manual switch, then go topside and deal with the Legion and NCR.
GID00002500	Well, problem is that's left us with enough Securitrons to drive off a weakened NCR force - probably - but not enough to keep them from coming back!
GID00002501	So what we do is take away the whole reason why they'd want to come back! Smart, huh?
GID00002502	I feel really bad telling you this, but I kind of... can't die. I mean, go ahead and destroy this Securitron, get it out of your system!
GID00002503	The problem is that a distributed image of my neuro-computational matrix is backed-up to the network several times a day, or when I'm threatened!
GID00002504	I can't help it! There's a little bit of me in every Securitron out on the Strip, so if this instance gets destroyed, I just download to a new one.
GID00002505	If I could stop it from happening, I would! I mean, your vengeance is going to feel so incomplete!
GID00002506	That was my fault! But I've changed!
GID00002507	Sorry if that was getting boring!
GID00002508	I see the wisdom in that. I'll radio for a unit to head up to Primm and offer some additional support.
GID00002509	Your memory is like a steel trap, boss. What do you think of guys like Ranger Andy?
GID00002510	That Loyal guy. He's getting up there in years, but he still finds a way to make himself useful to his people.
GID00002511	If you ask me, that's better than withering away all alone, or holding on to some faded piece of glory from your past.
GID00002512	Meeting Corporal Sterling, well... it kind of got me thinking.
GID00002513	Here's a guy that's been beat all to hell, right? I mean, he could have retired from the service, but instead he signs back on and does what he can.
GID00002514	You think he did the right thing?
GID00002515	No shit? Drink's on me, then.
GID00002516	Still, not like I'm going anywhere. Caravan title's still keeping me here, even though it's dead and gone.
GID00002517	I don't know, seems to be a lot of attention on Nipton. Word is, one of the snipers in the nest on the roof spotted smoke from the East.
GID00002518	Guess that settles that, then.
GID00002519	Don't matter much how we settle this, as long as it gets settled.
GID00002520	This is a null line no one will ever see.
GID00002521	This is a null line no one will ever see.
GID00002522	Hey, where the hell do you think you're going? Primm is off limits.
GID00002523	Some convicts from the prison up the road have taken over the town. Everyone inside is either dead or in hiding.
GID00002524	What's more, there are two tribes of raiders causing trouble in this area as well. You'd be safer heading back up to Goodsprings.
GID00002525	It's your ass. Don't say you weren't warned.
GID00002526	Be careful. You may want to talk to Lieutenant Hayes.
GID00002527	He's in a tent down the road. Just stay on the west side of the overpass if you don't want to get shot.
GID00002528	We'd love to, but they don't fall under NCR jurisdiction. Even if they did we're in no shape to protect them.
GID00002529	We don't have the equipment to take out the convicts, and even if we did we need some extra hands for backup.
GID00002530	You should talk to Lieutenant Hayes. He's in a tent down the road. Just stay on the west side of the overpass if you don't want to get shot.
GID00002531	A courier dropped it off a couple months back. I got it working for a little while, but the darn thing pooped out.
GID00002532	I haven't been able to get it up and running again. I was hoping to use it for some courier work, but that ain't gonna happen.
GID00002533	Hell if I know. I don't think its serious, but my tinkering days are long gone.
GID00002534	You're welcome to try. Its yours if you can get it working.
GID00002535	If I had my way I'd dump it in the scrapyard in Novac and be done with the damn thing.
GID00002536	That beat up old pile of bolts? What do you want to know?
GID00002537	A courier dropped it off a little bit ago. I'd hoped to get it up and running for some courier work, but never could get it running.
GID00002538	Can't say that I have, of course I never saw it running for long, so I never heard it do much of anything.
GID00002539	Not a bit. I imagine there must be some people around curious about that kind of technology.
GID00002540	Hey, Nipton! Eat me!
GID00002541	Who's the winner? Oliver Swanick, that's who! Yeah!
GID00002542	I won the fucking lottery, hear me! So fuck y'all! Whoohoo!
GID00002543	Ain't gonna see me up on a cross or my head on no pole, uh uh! That's for loooooosers!
GID00002544	I am a win-ner! I am a win-ner!
GID00002545	When I command you to complete a mission, you will complete it, or you should die in the attempt.
GID00002546	I will overlook this error, but only because I think you can still be useful.
GID00002547	You got it! I won't say another word about them!
GID00002548	Whatever you say!
GID00002549	Say no more, say no more... if you say they're good, they're good!
GID00002550	Say no more, say no more... if you say they're good, they're good!
GID00002551	Fuck you man, I ain't going nowhere with you.
GID00002552	Why don't you go cry to your wife, then - oh that's right! She left your worthless stinking ass!
GID00002553	It's the least I could do. All I ask is that you put it to good use. This place has lived in the shadow of Caesar for long enough.
GID00002554	I may not be the one to help stop him here, but you are. Fortis fortuna adiuvat. Good luck, and good bye.
GID00002555	I have to admit, I did not expect that sort of response.
GID00002556	This is one of the last surviving suits of original-issue Tesla armor from Navarro and it was worn by my father but... yeah I guess it's no big deal.
GID00002557	Good luck at Hoover Dam. I'll uh... be going now, I guess.
GID00002558	Back to Old Mormon Fort, where I can do some good. We Followers may be idealistic but even I know this is going to end in blood.
GID00002559	Fortis fortuna adiuvat. Good luck, and good bye.
GID00002560	War. War never changes.
GID00002561	When atomic fire consumed the earth, those who survived did so in great underground vaults.
GID00002562	When they opened, their inhabitants set out across the ruins of the Old World to build new societies, establishing villages, forming tribes.
GID00002563	As decades passed, what had been the American southwest united
GID00002564	beneath the flag of the New California Republic, dedicated to Old World values of democracy and the rule of law.
GID00002565	As the Republic grew, so did its needs. Scouts spread east, seeking territory and wealth in the dry and merciless expanse of the Mojave desert.
GID00002566	They returned with tales of a city untouched by the warheads that had scorched the rest of the world - and a great wall spanning the Colorado River.
GID00002567	The NCR mobilized its army and sent it east, to occupy Hoover Dam and restore it to working condition.
GID00002568	But across the Colorado, another society had arisen, under a different flag.
GID00002569	A vast army of slaves forged from the conquest of 86 tribes - Caesar's Legion.
GID00002570	Four years have passed since the Republic held the dam - just barely - against the Legion's onslaught. The Legion did not retreat.
GID00002571	Across the river, it gathers strength. Camp fires burn, training drums beat.
GID00002572	Through it all, the New Vegas Strip has stayed open for business, under the control of its mysterious overseer, Mr. House,
GID00002573	and his army of rehabilitated tribals and police robots.
GID00002574	You are a Courier, hired by the Mojave Express to deliver a package to the New Vegas Strip.
GID00002575	What seemed like a simple delivery job has taken a turn for the worse.
GID00002576	Wow. That thing is definitely carrying around a bunch of Enclave intel. Adams is on the eastern seaboard of the country.
GID00002577	Which means this little "Duraframe" sucker somehow managed to survive for over two thousand miles. Certainly lives up to its model name.
GID00002578	I don't want to be... alarmist or anything, but maybe you should ditch that Eyebot. Robot. Whatever that thing is.
GID00002579	Who knows what it's programmed for? Maybe tomorrow you'll take out an iguana-on-a-stick and that'll activate its mini-nuke self-destruct sequence.
GID00002580	I don't know if you care about my opinion, but I'd prefer that you turn ED-E over to the Followers. Surprised, right?
GID00002581	Some of the old-timers like Moreno hold grudges against the Brotherhood and the NCR. I'd like to think I'm above that, but you may be right.
GID00002582	I'm not going to pout and cry if you give him to the Brotherhood. I'd rather they have it than allow all that knowledge to disappear.
GID00002583	I'd just prefer that it goes to an organization like the Followers, who are less likely to use it for... violent purposes.
GID00002584	The Brotherhood hoards knowledge and is obviously a smidge more violent than the Followers.
GID00002585	Don't get me wrong. I'd rather the Brotherhood get the intel than see it lost somewhere in the desert, but I'd prefer the Followers overall.
GID00002586	Okay. Don't have to make a decision now. Just... sleep on it or something.
GID00002587	Great. Then all is right with the world.
GID00002588	This isn't the total we agreed upon. Don't waste my time, wastelander.
GID00002589	Done.

GID00002657	Done.
GID00002658	Fine. Would you mind explaining why you killed Anderson?
GID00002659	That's a grim deal to make. But when it came down to it, it's the same choice he made. Not all sacrifices are made by the willing.
GID00002660	But where is the lamb for this burnt offering?
GID00002661	That was his decision to make, not yours.
GID00002662	There are other ways to punish people, other ways to condemn their actions.
GID00002663	What the Followers always do. Whatever we can.
GID00002664	No, really. Have you ever snorted a ground up Cazador venom sac? Neither have I, but I can guarantee you that a Freeside junkie has.
GID00002665	Oh, all right. I'm thirty-ish. Well, late thirties. I was born... west of here. I was an only child and spent most of my time with my mother.
GID00002666	My father died when I was young and I never got over it. Oh... and I like medicine and reading books about failed Pre-War socioeconomic policies.
GID00002667	Right now, I'm sure you're asking yourself, "Why hasn't some lucky man scooped this bachelor off his feet?" Like I said, I'm boring.
GID00002668	Some people do. I just... don't.
GID00002669	Look, I appreciate that you're trying to be friendly, but I'd just rather not discuss it.
GID00002670	Okay, okay, you don't have to agree with me that much.
GID00002671	All right.
GID00002672	All right.
GID00002673	Great. Glad we're on the same page.
GID00002674	I mean, I didn't expect that you'd want to... activate the super weapon or anything.
GID00002675	Heh.
GID00002676	NCR troops control Hoover Dam. Why do they need more power?
GID00002677	O... kay.
GID00002678	Hmm. That's a valid point. I'm not really behind the NCR in all of this, but the last thing I want is panic in the streets.
GID00002679	Maybe if you're Mr. House you do. I bet the people in Freeside need it a lot more than he does.
GID00002680	Yeah, exactly. They don't.
GID00002681	Argh, you moron! You're going to kill all of the troopers down there!
GID00002682	That's it. I'm out. Good luck getting out of this place without being shot to pieces by NCR soldiers, assuming they aren't going to fry to death.
GID00002683	I'm thinking that I'm leaving because you are a sociopath. Good riddance.
GID00002684	Oh, to hell with this!
GID00002685	I figured you'd say that. Sometimes staying put is the best thing you can do.
GID00002686	I'll leave the fighting to the old warhorses. It's what they were made for.
GID00002687	I need to go take care of something before I set up at Freeside. I'll see you soon. And again, thanks for your help with the others.
GID00002688	I honestly didn't expect you to say that. When I talked to you about Daisy and the others, you seemed to put a lot of value in loyalty to the past.
GID00002689	What's changed since then?
GID00002690	Good point. You've been encouraging the others to stand up and fight, maybe I should take the same advice. After all, I also lived in Navarro.
GID00002691	There's something I need to go do, but I'll catch up with you later. Thanks again for your help with the others. It means a lot to me.
GID00002692	I'm surprised to hear you say that. I thought you had a problem with people who hold on to the past.
GID00002693	Suiting up to fight against Caesar with the Navarro veterans seems like... I don't know, like a kid playing dress up in his father's clothes.
GID00002694	True enough, I suppose. Getting them back together must be worth more than me spraying plasma all over the dam.
GID00002695	Back to Freeside it is. I need to make a stop before I settle in. I'll be back in a while. Thanks again for your help. It means a lot to me.
GID00002696	I am, but they're still my family. I think you were right the first time. If there's something I can do to help hold the dam, I'll do it.
GID00002697	Look, there's something I have to do, but I promise I'll be back in a while. Trust me. And thanks again for your help. It means a lot to me.
GID00002698	True enough. Maybe I can't fill my father's shoes. I wouldn't even know how.
GID00002699	But if following in his footsteps for a while means I can do some good out here, I will do my best.
GID00002700	I need to go do something. I won't be gone long, but I'll catch up with you later. Thanks for your help with the others. It means a lot to me.
GID00002701	No, I think it is the same for me. Maybe for a different reason, but... you can't hold on to a past you've never had.
GID00002702	For better or worse, I am not my father. I never had a life with the Enclave, and it would be silly for me to try to start one now.
GID00002703	I'll stay with you until the Legion moves on the dam, but once the attack starts, I'm going to have to go to back to Freeside. It's where I belong.
GID00002704	I need to take care of something, but I'll see you soon enough. Thanks for all of the help. It means a lot to me.
GID00002705	Of course, Caesar! You can hardly even hold his men responsible, given how they're practically raised to worship him as a living deity.
GID00002706	What's the point of surviving the war? Why did the founders of the Followers crawl their way out of vaults to bring knowledge back to the wasteland?
GID00002707	So we could act like the last two thousand years didn't happen? Play dress up so we can fight ancient wars all over again?
GID00002708	No way is he getting away with this. I'm not letting it happen. You're not letting it happen.
GID00002709	Being "smart" doesn't matter if you're insane. Everything makes sense to Caesar because he's twisted everything to his world view.
GID00002710	He's Caesar reincarnated, the NCR is the corrupt Roman senate. I wouldn't be surprised if he thought the Colorado River were the new Rubicon.
GID00002711	He abdicates responsibility to a myth of historical inevitability. But he's not Caesar. This isn't Rome. And he isn't going to get away with this.
GID00002712	Well, yeah! Right. What did I expect? The man's a megalomaniac. He acts like this is some pre-ordained cycle we're returning to.
GID00002713	Of all the people who could learn from our past mistakes, he goes and throws all of our knowledge off of a cliff.
GID00002714	Instead of trying to learn from the past, he re-creates it, runs back over the same old barren ground.
GID00002715	A fair point, but from the perspective of someone on the east side of Arizona, the man is clearly out of his mind.
GID00002716	Maybe he didn't intend for things to wind up this way, but that doesn't mean he needs to perpetuate this bizarre anachronistic myth.
GID00002717	And it doesn't mean that we should sit by and nod our heads at every absurd faux-Roman casus belli he can dream up.
GID00002718	He's a tyrant. The bad kind. And there's no way we're letting him take Hoover Dam.
GID00002719	You're platinum, pussycat! You know how to swing!
GID00002720	Nice charlies, too! Give them a shake for the Ben-man, will ya? Hello!
GID00002721	That was a nice bit of hey-hey, girlie. You're a real ring-a-ding broad!
GID00002722	Hold me, will ya? I swear you wore me out...
GID00002723	Be seeing you.
GID00002724	Your belongings will be returned to you when you leave.
GID00002725	Your belongings will be returned to you when you leave.
GID00002726	Freedom? Thank God Frank thinks we're enslaved.
GID00002727	Now we can actually start fresh. Thank you for helping us.
GID00002728	Why free me now? After what you done? I ain't saying thank you.
GID00002729	Why free me now? After what you done? I ain't saying thank you.
GID00002730	Freedom? I don't know where we'll get a new start, but any place is better than rotting with the legion or Frank.
GID00002731	<Sad stare>
GID00002732	[SUCCEEDED] Alright. 50/50 it is, but you better bring back all of the caps. If we hear you crossed us, the next bounty hunter will be coming for you.
GID00002733	[FAILED] Who the hell do you think you're talking to? Keep talking like that and your ass is going to be in the gutter. 25%. Take it or leave it.
GID00002734	[SUCCEEDED] All right. 50/50 it is, but you better bring back all of the caps.
GID00002735	If we hear you crossed us, the next bounty hunter will be coming for you.
GID00002736	[FAILED] Who the hell do you think you're talking to? Keep talking like that and your ass is going to be in the gutter. 25%. Take it or leave it.
GID00002737	You're probably right. Here, take it.
GID00002738	Aw shucks, pardner. I suppose it can't hurt to let you in on my little secret!
GID00002739	Old Victor woudn't be much use stuck inside just one Securitron! No, I can move from one to another with the snap of a finger!
GID00002740	Pretty nice trick, ain't it? Just don't ask me how I do it, because I don't know!
GID00002741	[You hear static.]
GID00002742	We were getting a little worried. Where's your partner? No, on second thought, don't tell me.
GID00002743	Give your report to the Elder, then have the doc look your over. Oh, and welcome back.
GID00002744	[You hear static.]
GID00002745	Stay where you are. I'm sending someone up to meet you.
GID00002746	[You hear static.]
GID00002747	We were getting a little worried. Where's your partner? No, on second thought, don't tell me.
GID00002748	Give your report to the Elder, then have the doc look your over. Oh, and welcome back.
GID00002749	[You hear static.]
GID00002750	Stay where you are. I'm sending someone up to meet you.
GID00002751	Done.
GID00002752	Done.
GID00002753	Done.
GID00002754	Done.
GID00002755	Done.
GID00002756	You're free to leave. The guard in the weather station will return the Chip to you when you're ready for Caesar's mission.
GID00002757	As you wish.
GID00002758	The guard in the weather station will return the Chip to you when you're ready for Caesar's mission. Otherwise, we can return to Cottonwood Cove.
GID00002759	Goodbye.
GID00002760	Sorry, friend, but I just can't do it.
GID00002761	Very well. I must confiscate your weapons.
GID00002762	Vale.
GID00002763	Speak to me when you are ready and I'll have your weapons returned.
GID00002764	Speak to me when you are ready and I'll have your weapons returned.
GID00002765	You waste time, then.
GID00002766	Done.
GID00002767	Very well.
GID00002768	Do I look destroyed, pardner? It's harder to put old Vic in Boot Hill than you might think!
GID00002769	I wouldn't be much use stuck inside just one Securitron! No, if the one I'm in turns up a goner, I just find another, fine as cream gravy!
GID00002770	Allow me to introduce myself! I'm the Securitron that dug you up in the bone orchard outside Goodsprings.
GID00002771	I thought you'd gone up the flume, but that Doc Mitchell knows his trade. It's good to see you up and around, right as a trivet!
GID00002772	The boss is waiting for ya.
GID00002773	All aboard!
GID00002774	Right away!
GID00002775	Heading up!
GID00002776	Heading down!
GID00002777	Howdy, Pardner! Let's skedaddle! Got something to show ya!
GID00002778	It's just at the top of the ridge here...
GID00002779	There you have it - New Vegas, pretty as a diamond flush.
GID00002780	Well, rambler, it's a royal flush that beats all! So let's crown this hand!
GID00002781	Well, darling, it's a royal flush that beats all! So let's crown this hand!
GID00002782	5... 4... 3... 2... 1!
GID00002783	Yee-haw! Ain't that pretty?
GID00002784	Don't take in the view for too long, though - word is, the Legion's on the move!
GID00002785	Head on back and see the boss real soon, hear? Evening.
GID00002786	What do you want done?
GID00002787	Done.
GID00002788	Done.
GID00002789	Okay.
GID00002790	Done.
GID00002791	Done.
GID00002792	Done.
GID00002793	Done.
GID00002794	Goodbye.
GID00002795	Goodbye.
GID00002796	What the hell are you talking about? What is this?
GID00002797	"The Free Economic Zone of New Vegas..." What the hell does that mean?! Oh, wait, here we go.
GID00002798	"Demands NCR's immediate withdrawal..." Withdrawal? Like fucking hell we're withdrawing... we just held the dam, we didn't do it to let it go!
GID00002799	This paper of yours? Isn't fit to wipe my ass. If you think after all that's happened, I'm going to grab my ankles and take it like the Legion...
GID00002800	See that you do.
GID00002801	Go.
GID00002802	We'll see.
GID00002803	Fix it, then. You're not leaving until it's done and Caesar lives.
GID00002804	Do it, then. You're not leaving until it's done and Caesar lives.
GID00002805	Good. I'll have my men seize him immediately.
GID00002806	Then you die.
GID00002807	You had your chance. Now you die.
GID00002808	So tell me, did you really think I'd be stupid enough to fall for this again? One of my men saw you go in and out of the Kings' place.
GID00002809	As much as I hate to lose a customer, it's just unavoidable sometimes.
GID00002810	Fuck, no. If I knew where this bitch was, do you think I'd be asking you?
GID00002811	Still, there's someone who might - old Alice McLafferty, Crimson Caravan, might know something.
GID00002812	She keeps tabs on caravan traffic in the Mojave, wouldn't put it past her to keep track of Cassidy Caravans and its owner.
GID00002813	Yes, that's what he wants us to believe. And when we turn our attention to other threats, he'll begin moving against us.
GID00002814	No, far safer to simply eliminate him and the risk he represents now. Besides, with him gone, New Vegas will truly be ours once the dust settles.
GID00002815	Any other objections or questions?
GID00002816	It will be done.
GID00002817	Caesar's health worsens, and your indecision is unhelpful.
GID00002818	Let me get to my chair.
GID00002819	I said, let me get to my chair.
GID00002820	I suppose you're right. When you're part of something for that long, maybe it's impossible to let go without losing part of yourself.
GID00002821	Moreno may be a stubborn son of a bitch, but at least he's loyal.
GID00002822	It's been decades, you know. By now, he's been out of the Enclave longer than he was in.
GID00002823	Most people know when to hang it up and start over. But not Moreno.
GID00002824	As screwed up as it sounds, at least she was part of something. Granted, it was something... admittedly, pretty bad, but it was something.
GID00002825	If you spent the first half of your life flying Enclave troopers in a vertibird, I suppose picking over Pre-War rocket parts doesn't quite compare.
GID00002826	Not much glory in the Enclave. Most of her old comrades are long gone.
GID00002827	I know life as a salvager can't compare to being a vertibird pilot but... at least it's life. That has to count for something.
GID00002828	I wonder if he would. It's pointless, I know, but sometimes I wonder what he wanted me to be.
GID00002829	Maybe being a doctor in the middle of Nevada wasn't exactly what he had in mind for his little boy.
GID00002830	I grew up without him. I'll always feel like something is missing from my life. But you're right.
GID00002831	It's not like I'm the only kid in the wasteland who's grown up without a dad. Johnson always said my father was a good man.
GID00002832	If that's the only thing about me that's like him, that's enough for me.
GID00002833	Not everyone dreams of being a revolutionary, I suppose. Maybe we can't all change the world.
GID00002834	Maybe it's enough just to do good for the short time that we're here. No one's going to sing Doc Henry's praises when he's gone.
GID00002835	But he's probably saved more lives than I ever will.
GID00002836	I'm sure Henry has goals. He was just more concerned with the "how" than the "why" of things. Being in the Enclave didn't really mean much to him.
GID00002837	I guess I'm lucky that I'm part of the Followers. Helping people as a doctor is important, but with the Followers, it feels different.
GID00002838	It feels like we're working toward something more important. That's more than the sum of good deeds that we do.
GID00002839	Sometimes I wonder how much of my father they see in me. They went through a lot together, but my family went through it, too.
GID00002840	I'm glad they've watched out for me all these years. Maybe someday I can return the favor.
GID00002841	Oh, I know. I was only a boy when they went through hell together. I'm glad you're helping me reunite them.
GID00002842	Even if I'm still just a spectator in all of this, I know they can still do some good.
GID00002843	I've been wondering about Daisy and the others for so long, I still haven't figured out what I should do.
GID00002844	I mean, I'm not like them. I was born at Navarro and my father served with them, but I wasn't really part of the Enclave.
GID00002845	It seems presumptuous of me to think that I could join the fight, even if this is a cause worth fighting for.
GID00002846	Because I know when fighting breaks out at the dam, all hell is going to break loose in Freeside. They're going to need every doctor they can get.
GID00002847	Hold on a second. I need to talk to you about something else.
GID00002848	It's called an Auto-Doc. As the name suggests, it's an automated physician - more or less.
GID00002849	It can treat broken bones, cuts, punctures, scrapes. Sometimes I bestow its use upon someone I favor.
GID00002850	Makes for a powerful gift, in a culture that forbids painkillers and is largely ignorant of medical science.
GID00002851	It's called an Auto-Doc. As the name suggests, it's an automated physician - more or less.
GID00002852	It can treat broken bones, cuts, punctures, scrapes. Sometimes I bestow its use upon someone I favor.
GID00002853	Makes for a powerful gift, in a culture that forbids painkillers and is largely ignorant of medical science.
GID00002854	Fuck this, I'm going to lie down!
GID00002855	Come back later - tomorrow!
GID00002856	Fuck this, I'm going to lie down!
GID00002857	Come back later - tomorrow!
GID00002858	[SUCCEEDED] Never this... bad before.
GID00002859	[FAILED] What's it look like, you asshole?
GID00002860	[SUCCEEDED] Never this... bad before.
GID00002861	[FAILED] What's it look like, you asshole?
GID00002862	[SUCCEEDED] A week, maybe two... it doesn't matter!
GID00002863	[FAILED] Fuck off.
GID00002864	Disturb me again and I'll have you killed!
GID00002865	I get headaches every once in a while. So what? Anyway, we have other matters to discuss.
GID00002866	I was saying that I'd planned to ask you to forge an alliance with them, but you killed their leaders.
GID00002867	By the time the White Gloves sort themselves out, the battle for Hoover Dam will have come and gone. So, on to the next matter at hand...
GID00002868	[SUCCEEDED] I appreciate your concern, but I'm in excellent health. And we have other matters to discuss.
GID00002869	[FAILED] Only when you're around.
GID00002870	Hmm...
GID00002871	Huh... Yeah. Yeah.
GID00002872	Yeah, the Brotherhood. Them.
GID00002873	[SUCCEEDED] I don't know... There have been a couple...
GID00002874	[FAILED] I'm... I'm not sure. What was I saying? That's right, the Brotherhood...
GID00002875	It's nothing. Just tired, that's all.
GID00002876	Look for the Brotherhood's bunker around, uh... Hidden Valley. My scouts... saw some things.
GID00002877	I'm going to bed. We'll talk later.
GID00002878	[SUCCEEDED] Don't... just leave it alone. I'm fine. Now what was I saying...? Right.
GID00002879	Take care of the Brotherhood. Maybe then we can have a conversation.
GID00002880	I said, take care of the Brotherhood. Then we talk - maybe.
GID00002881	It's never had a functional diagnostic scanning module. Without that, it's useless for surgery.
GID00002882	[SUCCEEDED] I figured as much.
GID00002883	Congratulations, you just became my personal physician. Do you have what you need to treat my condition?
GID00002884	[FAILED] Yeah, it does. So if you can't help me, who can?
GID00002885	[SUCCEEDED] I'm not familiar with that condition. Is it treatable?
GID00002886	[FAILED] There's nothing "moderate" about the severity of this. And if you're going to make up names for diseases, come up with good ones.
GID00002887	If you can't help me, who can?
GID00002888	[SUCCEEDED] Then gather those items together and hurry back to perform the operation. I don't know how long I've got.
GID00002889	[FAILED] Then gather the tools you need, and study up on your medical skills.
GID00002890	When you're confident you can perform the operation, hurry back. I don't know how long I've got.
GID00002891	[SUCCEEDED] Then go find some proper Surgical Tools. The medications from a Doctor's Bag might come in handy, too.
GID00002892	I'll make sure you're allowed to bring the necessary medications into the camp. Hurry back. I don't know how long I've got.
GID00002893	[FAILED] If you think this is funny, you should give crucifixion a try. Now that's hilarious.
GID00002894	If you can't help me, who can?
GID00002895	And where is this Arcade?
GID00002896	I'll have my guards take him captive. If he cures my condition, I'll see to it that your reward is several times his value.
GID00002897	All right. Just leave him outside the tent when you return. If he cures my condition, I'll see to it that your reward is several times his value.
GID00002898	Be on your way, then. And try not to take too long.
GID00002899	It's been said that Auto-Docs were standard equipment in the underground Vaults where mankind survived when the bombs fell centuries ago.
GID00002900	You can search the Vaults, but every Auto-Doc my Legion has run across has been stripped for parts long before we found it.
GID00002901	Some of my scouts did report an abandoned Vault near Nellis Air Force Base. Overrun by ghouls, they said.
GID00002902	Maybe the infestation has been there long enough to keep scavengers out. Why don't you go and see?
GID00002903	Vale.
GID00002904	And what would that be?
GID00002905	Do that. And try not to take too long.
GID00002906	Take a look.
GID00002907	For you? I'm not sure I want to be seen dealing with you... but if you're willing to pay a little extra...
GID00002908	What, Caravan? All right, I'll give it a go. Haven't exactly got much of a line of folks to serve.
GID00002909	All right, go on - let's put our cards down.
GID00002910	Not too much, lot of caravans going nowhere. Lot of troopers going nowhere, too.
GID00002911	Few prospectors here and there, but... they don't do more than stink up the place.
GID00002912	Everybody's backed up here. You think it'd be good for business, but most of the traders are tight with the caps, even the larger caravan outfits.
GID00002913	Work around here? Might check with Jackson in the main building. Or Ghost up on the roof above, but watch out, she's... well, she's kind of a bitch.
GID00002914	Don't tell her I said that, though. Might take a bullet some night when I'm going to the latrine.
GID00002915	Fine, then.
GID00002916	Just need something for the log book, keeping tabs on traffic through the Outpost... although mostly just in, not out these days.
GID00002917	If you're looking for the commanding officer, he's in the back. Although... he's got a lot on his plate, so if you speak with him... keep it short.
GID00002918	Also, you need any gear checked, we can get you up and running again... once you fill out the work orders, and sign for the parts, of course.
GID00002919	Reinforcements? About time we got some more hands around here.
GID00002920	Oh - Knight. You must not be from around here. If so... it doesn't do to get too friendly.
GID00002921	This isn't the Republic. Oddly enough, Legion's a little more forgiving about... friendships. Out here, it's not as accepted.
GID00002922	Not that I mind being friends, it's just being open about it in the Outpost... well, I have to work here.
GID00002923	Now wait a minute - Republic's a sight better than... other alternatives. Women are serving here, after all. The rest... well, might take some time.
GID00002924	And they're more accepting back West, like I said. In the meantime...
GID00002925	Wait... wait a minute. Look. Some things in the NCR are... aren't ideal. But I want to help.
GID00002926	If you need something repaired... let me know, I can sign the work order. As long as caps change hands, I can put them back in yours.
GID00002927	I... would, perhaps some other time. When my orders take me to Vegas, perhaps. Wish things were different, but might take some time.
GID00002928	Let me sign off on the work order for you, then.
GID00002929	Hey, look over there! It's those Mojave rats again, coming to take our water!
GID00002930	You, over there! Go back where you came from, thieves! Don't try our patience!
GID00002931	Screw it. Just shoot! They'll get the hint!
GID00002932	Hurry! We've got to get some before they notice us!
GID00002933	Oh shit! They saw us. Get out of here, quick!
GID00002934	Fuck you, NCR thugs! This is our land, and you won't last here forever!
GID00002935	Sure. Here's what I've got.
GID00002936	Stay safe.
GID00002937	Then I bid you "Vale" - until we meet again.
GID00002938	Nipton was a wicked place, debased and corrupt. It served all comers, so long as they paid.
GID00002939	Profligate troops, Powder Gangers - or men of the Legion. The people here didn't care. It was a town of whores.
GID00002940	For a pittance, the great Vulpes Inculta inveigled this town to lead those it had sheltered into a trap.
GID00002941	Only when it was sprung did they realize they were caught inside it, too. I only wish Vulpes had lived to see the scheme come to fruition.
GID00002942	Yes, and herded them to the center of town. I told them their sins, the foremost being disloyalty.
GID00002943	I told them that when Legionaries are disloyal, some are punished, the others made to watch. And I announced the lottery.
GID00002944	Each clutched his ticket, hoping it would set him free. Each did nothing, even when "loved ones" were dragged away to be killed.
GID00002945	I think your eyes will see more than I could ever tell you. Take your time. Enjoy the sights.
GID00002946	Why, then, do you keep asking?
GID00002947	Innocent? Hardly.
GID00002948	Cowardly, though. They outnumbered us, yet not once did they try to resist.
GID00002949	They stood and watched as their fellows were butchered, crucified, and burned, one by one.
GID00002950	They stood and hoped their turn would not come. Each cared only for himself.
GID00002951	It has a stark beauty, doesn't it? I'm glad you can appreciate it.
GID00002952	Now go, and teach the Mojave Outpost what you learned here. There will be more lessons in the days ahead.
GID00002953	Yes, they did. As will all the rest of you, in due time.
GID00002954	Now go, and teach the Mojave Outpost what you've learned here. There will be more lessons in the days ahead.
GID00002955	You're unusually bright for a Profligate. Well done.
GID00002956	Now go, and teach what you've learned here. There will be more lessons in the days ahead.
GID00002957	It has a stark beauty, doesn't it? I'm glad you can appreciate it.
GID00002958	Now go, and teach them what you learned here. There will be more lessons in the days ahead.
GID00002959	You bear the Mark of Caesar. That makes you special.
GID00002960	Do whatever Caesar tells you to do. And whenever the opportunity presents, strike at the Profligates. Pile body upon body.
GID00002961	Tell everyone you meet of what you saw here. The Legion can handle the rest.
GID00002962	That said, if you were to strike at the Profligates, butcher them, trouble their operations... this will not go unnoticed.
GID00002963	Indeed, our hounds demonstrate greater loyalty to each other every day than the wretched inhabitants of this town.
GID00002964	What can be said? He's a man of towering intellect, the founder of the Legion, conquerer of 86 tribes.
GID00002965	Caesar is the salvation of mankind, his Legion the rebirth of civilization in a benighted age.
GID00002966	Don't worry, you'll know him well when you serve him. Or you'll be dead.
GID00002967	Legatus Lanius, Monster of the East! Quite a man, if man he be.
GID00002968	Caesar prides himself on selecting the right tool to overcome each new obstacle. In Lanius, he found his hammer.
GID00002969	He's never been defeated in battle. 14 tribes have laid down arms at his boots. Another five, rendered extinct.
GID00002970	His latest campaign in the wilds of the Utah has concluded, and he is en route. When he arrives, your doom arrives with him.
GID00002971	Hey... Look! Someone's coming out of the 38!
GID00002972	What? are you serious? I've got to see that!
GID00002973	I thought nobody has ever been inside that place.
GID00002974	Wow... that's crazy.
GID00002975	That one must be important around here!
GID00002976	Check that out! He just left the Lucky 38!
GID00002977	Check that out! She just left the Lucky 38!
GID00002978	Damn! And he looks good to me, too.
GID00002979	Damn! And she looks good to me, too.
GID00002980	Nothing, man.
GID00002981	Just hanging out. Same as usual.
GID00002982	I was thinking of taking a walk a little later.
GID00002983	I might be going scum-hunting later. You game?
GID00002984	Nothing. Want to head to the Wrangler later?
GID00002985	Yeah, sounds cool.
GID00002986	Nah, I'm gonna be busy.
GID00002987	Maybe, depends on how my girl's feeling.
GID00002988	Veronica.
GID00002989	I hope you've been practicing your drills, Veronica. It's dangerous outside.
GID00002990	Hmm? Oh, it's you, Veronica.
GID00002991	Yes, yes.
GID00002992	Behave yourself this time, Veronica.
GID00002993	Hey yourself, kiddo.
GID00002994	Quite well. Thank you for asking, Veronica.
GID00002995	Y-Yes. Well, it's, ah, nice to see you, too, Veronica.
GID00002996	Hmph.
GID00002997	Well, I have been working with some UV lights in the pods.
GID00002998	Very funny, Veronica.
GID00002999	Can't complain. Not like there's anywhere else to go, right?
GID00003000	With everyone getting to go to the surface, I'm a little jealous, but I'll be fine.
GID00003001	Still hiding that hair of yours, Veronica?
GID00003002	I'm surprised you're not wearing that hood to hide your hair like you usually do, Veronica.
GID00003003	Veronica.
GID00003004	Kind of you to say, but there are better people than me around here. I just hope the Followers can make a difference in the long run.
GID00003005	It isn't enough to mean well if you don't do good. I'm sure Caesar meant well, too.
GID00003006	If you lose your humanity, then I suppose that is all that's left.
GID00003007	I know I shouldn't place one life below another, but in Caesar's case, I'll make an exception.
GID00003008	The whole "slavery and cultural annihilation" stance he's adopted is bit repugnant to me.
GID00003009	Though I guess what I think never really mattered much to you, did it?
GID00003010	Victrix causa deis placuit sed victa Catoni.
GID00003011	Goodbye, courier.
GID00003012	In the words of Socrates, "Go fornicate yourself."
GID00003013	At least the mess is ours to clean up.
GID00003014	Wait a minute... am I going crazy or are you actually suggesting it might not be bad if the Legion takes over?
GID00003015	It's a good thing to be, but you may want to close the floodgates once you see how Caesar runs things.
GID00003016	Okay. I just wanted you to confirm that I'm traveling in the company of an insane fascist. Thanks.
GID00003017	If the NCR is broken, it will fail on its own.
GID00003018	The people who live here don't deserve to be victims of your misguided attempts at political engineering.
GID00003019	Or are they just collateral damage?
GID00003020	What?! Caesar is going to enslave or kill everyone in the Mojave.
GID00003021	And when that's done, he'll try to destroy the NCR senate and install himself as its new military dictator.
GID00003022	I can't comprehend how Caesar could so extensively scramble your sense of morality to make you think the Legion is a better alternative to anything.
GID00003023	And you know what? I'm not going to stick around to try to figure it out. At least legionaries have the excuse of being born into it.
GID00003024	Have a nice life.
GID00003025	Great! You're either unimaginably cruel or profoundly insane!
GID00003026	Either way, I'm not going to wait around for you to help the Legion roll across Hoover Dam. Bye.
GID00003027	How noble of you.
GID00003028	Sorry, but I won't be sticking around to see if you have the courtesy to lay flowers on the mass grave that the Legion's going to dig for them.
GID00003029	Sure, if you're a sociopath.
GID00003030	Enjoy the fruits of your labor.
GID00003031	They sure don't, but I hope you get everything that's coming to you.
GID00003032	Have a nice life.
GID00003033	If by "sometimes" you mean "a lot of times," I agree. Please, just... settle down, okay?
GID00003034	That wasn't exactly the response I was hoping for, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.
GID00003035	Seriously, though, watch it.
GID00003036	If you insist. Have a nice life.
GID00003037	Because you're helping Caesar's Legion. They are bad. You are bad. I am going. Bye.
GID00003038	Why are you crazy? That's a question for someone much wiser and more patient than myself.
GID00003039	All I know is that you are a bad person and I don't want to be around you anymore. So if that was your goal, congratulations.
GID00003040	If not, I'm sorry to inform you that you are, as the locals say, "nuttier than a Bighorner dropping."
GID00003041	That was the plan. Bye.
GID00003042	Good. "In hoc signo taurus vinces."
GID00003043	Report to Legatus Lanius immediately - he'll brief you on the plan of battle. Come back victorious, or don't come back.
GID00003044	Then be quick about it.
GID00003045	It's a travesty, is what it is. Every second we sit on our hands down here is another second that we're not fulfilling our sworn duty.
GID00003046	It's not that I dislike the Elder, but I strongly disapprove of his current style of leadership. We're safe, yes, but at what cost?
GID00003047	After lifting the lockdown, the first thing I'd do is send scouts out to recon the area. We need to know what's going on out there.
GID00003048	Next, I'd resume patrols in the near vicinity, and begin sending search teams out to the spots the scouts reported were relatively safe.
GID00003049	It's standard procedure when a chapter relocates to an area, but standard procedure wasn't our last Elder's style, either.
GID00003050	It's a protective measure that was enacted after our defeat at HELIOS. The NCR was hot on our heels, and we wouldn't have survived another encounter.
GID00003051	It was decided that we would stay quiet for a time, heal the wounded, and try to come up with a new strategy.
GID00003052	However, after we had fully recuperated, our first scouting measures showed that the NCR's presence in this region had only increased in our absence.
GID00003053	There are now more than five times the number of NCR troops in the area as when we fought them, and we have half the number we did at HELIOS.
GID00003054	And so the lockdown has been extended. To go outside would be the death of us all.
GID00003055	We have some personnel that are allowed to travel on the surface. They trade for what we need, and occasionally drop off what they acquire.
GID00003056	We make sure that they only enter or leave the bunker while the sandstorm is active, to avoid detection.
GID00003057	All right. What did you wish to speak about?
GID00003058	That is this base's defensive system. It serves as camouflage and masks all entry and exit from the bunker.
GID00003059	We use it to hide our patrols and supply runners, though we still send such out at night to be extra safe.
GID00003060	We were overrun, plain and simple. My Brothers fought with great courage, but in the end the enemy was just too many.
GID00003061	When the tide of the battle turned for the worse, our Elder was nowhere to be found, and everything was chaos.
GID00003062	Fully half of our forces had already fallen. I gathered up those I could find and we fought our way here.
GID00003063	This place had been briefly discussed as a fallback point, though at the time none really believed that could possibly become necessary.
GID00003064	That's it, really. There was nothing glorious about the battle, just a nightmare of screams, blood, and death.
GID00003065	Oh yes, he's been trying for quite some time. Hardin has been strongly opposed to the lockdown from the first. It goes against his nature, you see.
GID00003066	Hardin's the type to fight to the last, and die rather than surrender. It's a good trait to have in a soldier, and a bad one to have in a leader.
GID00003067	Don't let his actions bother you. He's only doing what he thinks is best for the chapter.
GID00003068	Yes, I've always known they were. Luckily, they don't know exactly where we are. And even if they did, our position here is fortified.
GID00003069	And assuming they managed to breach the bunker, I would be forced to activate our failsafe system.
GID00003070	Better we all die than allow the technology we have here to fall into such unworthy hands.
GID00003071	I suppose it was only a matter of time. I wonder if, given the NCR's current situation, they would consider a truce of sorts?
GID00003072	We've given up our claim to HELIOS, and we don't have any interest in claiming Hoover Dam, so our ambitions are not at crossed purposes.
GID00003073	Perhaps it's time for a new strategy. Go to the NCR commander and tell her the Brotherhood is willing to put aside our enmity for the time being.
GID00003074	Further, tell her that we are willing to send troops to aid in their coming defense of the Dam. My guess is they're in no position to refuse.
GID00003075	Hungry? Thirsty? Horny? The Atomic Wrangler has you covered!
GID00003076	Wanna get lucky? Head on down to the Atomic Wrangler!

GID00003079	If it can be bought, it can be found at Mick and Ralph's!

GID00003084	HELIOS was the worst goddamned action I've seen in a long, long career of fighting.
GID00003085	Elijah was a strange one. His even becoming Elder was highly questionable, seeing as how he was a Scribe. Typically, only Paladins are eligible.
GID00003086	But an exception was made in his case, on account of him being a genius. Unfortunately, whatever scientific acumen he had didn't extend to tactics.
GID00003087	Trying to defend HELIOS was a blunder of the worst kind, and many brothers lost their lives because of it.
GID00003088	Many of the senior paladins, myself included, advised him to fight a retreating action, but he refused to budge. Said he almost "had it working".
GID00003089	We never did find out exactly what he was talking about. When the perimeter was finally overrun, the Elder had simply vanished.
GID00003090	Male, Good Karma.
GID00003091	Male, Neutral Karma.
GID00003092	Male, Evil Karma.
GID00003093	Female, Good Karma.
GID00003094	Female, Neutral Karma.
GID00003095	Female, Evil Karma.
GID00003096	Outpost, Mojave Outpost. Watching a lot of nothing, feels like a big Brahmin pen for caravans.
GID00003097	They've been stopped for a while, waiting for the roads North to clear - or their clearance papers to go through.
GID00003098	Look like you've walked a ways, so if you need to shake the dust off, head to the Barracks, the bar's there. Not much, but better than nothing.
GID00003099	Those two? Represents unification. Mostly good for shade. Won't do much else when the Legion reaches us.
GID00003100	Nothing I know of, but if you've come from the North, means you can travel freer than most around here.
GID00003101	Might check the Barracks, someone might need you to hoof it somewhere. Just be careful if you go up on the roof - got a sniper watching the road.
GID00003102	If you're gear's in need of repair, HQ's also worth checking out - talk to Major Knight, he can help. Provided you got a pen and plenty of ink.
GID00003103	Watch yourself.
GID00003104	You've certainly earned the right, but I'm afraid there's a slight matter of protocol that must be dealt with first.
GID00003105	Exceptional individuals, like yourself, are sometimes allowed to join the Brotherhood if they perform a valuable service for it.
GID00003106	While your actions up to this point have been commendable, I'm afraid they don't quite qualify as such a service.
GID00003107	However, I do have another task that fits the bill rather nicely. Would you consider undertaking it?
GID00003108	The task I had in mind is still available, if you're up for it.
GID00003109	As one of our patrols discovered, the mutants just to the northeast have become strangely violent in the years we were secluded.
GID00003110	However, this turn of events could also be an opportunity. We mostly left the equipment of the communications array there alone, out of respect.
GID00003111	As the inhabitants have now proven themselves hostile, no more respect will accorded them. Making their equipment fair game.
GID00003112	I want you to head up to the summit of Black Mountain and install this remote signal transmitter in one of their consoles.
GID00003113	It will allow us to tap into the radar and other detection systems running there, assuming they're still operational.
GID00003114	If we're going to operate on the surface again, it would be nice to do so with as much information at our fingertips as possible. Good luck.
GID00003115	Do not hesitate, my friend. Learn from my mistake and go boldly, one way or the other.
GID00003116	Regrettable, but understandable. Should you change your mind, return here. I will hold off on assigning the task to my brethren, for now.
GID00003117	Yes, we've already started receiving telemetry from it. This will be a great help in our future efforts, and I thank you.
GID00003118	Now then, it is my great honor to bestow upon you the title of Paladin of the Brotherhood, for meritorious service above and beyond the call of duty.
GID00003119	I'm afraid a formal ceremony was out of the question given our current state, but I hope this will make up for it.
GID00003120	I had the knights refurbish a suit of our power armor for your use. It's one of the earlier models, but it should serve you well.
GID00003121	Now, I suppose I'm going to have to show you how to use it, aren't I?
GID00003122	Would you like to tell me where you learned such a thing?
GID00003123	No, don't bother. A person as well-traveled as yourself is bound to pick up all kinds of skills, I suppose. Luckily, that's not all I have for you.
GID00003124	First, let's go over how to put it on...
GID00003125	If only it were that simple. Think of power armor as a machine to be operated rather than clothing you'd wear.
GID00003126	With a little instruction, using it becomes as natural as simple movement, but to the ignorant, it's just so much heavy junk.
GID00003127	So let's bring you up to speed, shall we?
GID00003128	...There, I think you've got the knack of it now. You should now be able to wear any kind of power armor you come across.
GID00003129	I've also given the order that all of our equipment be made available to you, not just the more mundane arms.
GID00003130	You're a member of the Brotherhood now, and your gear should reflect that.
GID00003131	Lastly, you will be allowed to come and go as you please. You've done so much for us that to do otherwise would be a crime.
GID00003132	I just ask that you keep the Brotherhood's interests at heart in all your dealings. Remember that you will always have a home here.
GID00003133	Stop thinking so much. Thanks.
GID00003134	There are a number of people I'll need to talk to. The process won't be instantaneous, but with this evidence, my path is clear.
GID00003135	It shouldn't take more than a few days, and then we can begin moving forward again.
GID00003136	No, your role in this is done. The rest is up to us. There is much for me to do to make the transition as smooth as possible.
GID00003137	Come back in a few days, and I should be firmly installed as Elder.
GID00003138	While I can't dispute that you've earned our gratitude, I'm afraid you're going to have to be patient. Such a change takes time.
GID00003139	Stop back in a few days, and we can speak of this again. Now, I must be off. There is much to do!
GID00003140	Yes, I thought you might, given how much time you've spent here.
GID00003141	That's not usually a request we agree to. Typically, we take in the young, so that they might be trained through adolescence.
GID00003142	In special cases, we allow exceptional individuals to conditionally join. Luckily for you, you happen to be exceptional.
GID00003143	The condition is that you must complete a task. This task must prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that you have what it takes to join the Brotherhood.
GID00003144	I happen to have something perfectly suitable in mind, though I warn you - it won't be easy. Still interested?
GID00003145	Had second thoughts, did you? We've made some progress since the lockdown was lifted, but the task I had in mind is still available if you want it.
GID00003146	Back when we were stationed at HELIOS, our scouts reported that a group was establishing itself in the area as a distributor of Pre-War weapons.
GID00003147	Our Elder at the time, Elijah, was too concerned with getting HELIOS running and fending off the NCR, so he ordered us to leave them alone.
GID00003148	It's time that we correct that oversight, and show this region that the Brotherhood is still a force to be reckoned with.
GID00003149	I want you to visit these weapons dealers, this Van Graff family, and make an example of them. Leave no one alive.
GID00003150	When the job is done, report back and I'll arrange for a team to clean up the site and retrieve the weapons.
GID00003151	Is that a waver of resolve I sense? The Brotherhood is not in the habit of taking on the timid.
GID00003152	Hmph, I thought you were made of sterner stuff than that. The Brotherhood could use someone with your skills.
GID00003153	In any case, was there something else you wanted?
GID00003154	Now you're just wasting my time. When you make up your mind, let me know.
GID00003155	Well done. This is a small step in the right direction, but it's damn good to move forward again. Now, I believe congratulations are in order.
GID00003156	It is my honor to bestow up on you the title of Paladin of the Brotherhood, for your meritorious service in its name.
GID00003157	Normally, there'd be a ceremony and such, but everyone is too busy at the moment for such frivolity.
GID00003158	I can give you this, however. Your very own suit of power armor. We can't spare our best, but I had the knights assemble this one for your use.
GID00003159	Which reminds me, you don't even know how to use these, do you?
GID00003160	Predecessor's records indicate matching item purchased by nervous man wearing metal collar.
GID00003161	Records indicate man requested free lodging and was directed to concrete building in Freeside. Transmitting coordinates.
GID00003162	...There, I think you've got the hang of it now. You should be able to use any type of power armor you come across using what you just learned.
GID00003163	Very well, then. In addition to the armor, I've given the order that all of our arms and equipment be made available for your purchase.
GID00003164	Finally, while you are now a member of the Brotherhood, I cannot ask any more of you. I'm sure you have goals of your own outside these walls.
GID00003165	You are free to come and go as you please, though I hope you'll return to us someday in a more permanent capacity.
GID00003166	I wish you the best, outsid- Brother.
GID00003167	Hmm... I'm starting to remember hearing some rumors about you and this crazy guy called "Caesar." Bad. Not a friend of the Followers.
GID00003168	Maybe they're not all true. That's enough for me to stand here and talk to you, but I'm not about to leave Freeside as your comrade-in-arms.
GID00003169	You've helped the Followers, so you can't be entirely bad. To be honest, I haven't heard anyone say a negative word about you.
GID00003170	As long as you keep working to help people around here get a fair shake, sure, I'll lend a hand.
GID00003171	You helped the Followers, but your reputation isn't exactly spotless. How do I know you're not going to lose it out there?
GID00003172	Here's my proposition. If you want to work together to help the people around here, I'll lend a hand. If you start acting like a crazy waster...
GID00003173	Look, the Followers have had enough of a role in the misery that this area has had to endure.
GID00003174	If you want to go off half-cocked and leave a trail of corpses in your wake, that's your business. We'll do our best to clean up your mess.
GID00003175	Just don't try to drag us into it personally, okay?
GID00003176	Certainly.
GID00003177	The last time we discussed this, you didn't exactly wow me with your pitch. What have you got for me this time?
GID00003178	That's one way to look at it.
GID00003179	I thought my charm could win you over, but I guess it wasn't meant to be. Are you sure you want me to go?
GID00003180	All right, I'll head back to the Old Mormon Fort. If you need me, just swing by.
GID00003181	Ugh. I guess that means I have to go back to that creepy mausoleum Mr. House calls the Lucky 38.
GID00003182	I've been around a few unsettling places in my life, but that place takes the cake.
GID00003183	Anyway, if you need me, you know where to find me.
GID00003184	Back to the tomb, I suppose.
GID00003185	If you need me, et cetera.
GID00003186	It just seems a little twitchy. Some of these robots, you look at them the wrong way, don't screw in a vacuum tube right...
GID00003187	The next thing you know you're a pile of ash on the floor and someone's stepping out of a vertibird to sweep your remains into a Nuka-Cola bottle.
GID00003188	Fine, ignore me. Just don't ask me to re-attach your arm when your pet murder machine goes into "search and destroy" mode.
GID00003189	It's... a thing. A science thing. It hurts robots. Don't worry about it. Silly Arcade's just telling magnetic field jokes for his own amusement.
GID00003190	Ahem. Shall we?
GID00003191	Does it? Does it?
GID00003192	Safety first. That's all I'm saying.
GID00003193	Only to obfuscate my past association with a fascist paramilitary organization.
GID00003194	I'm joking, of course. I will deflect personal questions at any opportunity.
GID00003195	Honestly, it isn't too difficult if you have half a brain and aren't a complete jerk. I wanted to help people and I enjoyed learning, so I signed up.
GID00003196	New Vegas is in trouble, so I came out here. If someone doesn't step up and try to help the people here, it's going to end very badly.
GID00003197	The Followers taught me everything I know about medicine. Despite our humble abode here in New Vegas, we have great facilities back in the NCR.
GID00003198	We may have over extended ourselves by setting up camp in Freeside, but the people here need help from someone. If not us, who?
GID00003199	Don't mind if I do. Enjoy your reign as King Scumbag the First, Overlord of Westside.
GID00003200	Don't mind if I do. Enjoy your reign as Queen Scumbag the First, Overlord of Westside.
GID00003201	Any day now, Caesar's going to try to march across Hoover Dam and kick NCR out of the Mojave.
GID00003202	We're getting caught up in something important out here. Hell, after how you handled Benny, you're practically right in the middle of all this.
GID00003203	I know I'm just along for the ride, but it's made me think about the past, how I might be able to help out.
GID00003204	Actually, I'm going to keep talking anyway. Sorry, but I really need to get this out.
GID00003205	I wasn't always with the Followers, or with the NCR.
GID00003206	My late father was an officer in a group called the Enclave, a remnant of America's Pre-War government.
GID00003207	Memories being short around here, not a whole lot of people remember them. But they did bad things. Terrorized communities, kidnapped people.
GID00003208	Eventually, someone stopped them. I was born a few years later at a military base on the coast, a place called Navarro.
GID00003209	Are you sure? I didn't even get to the ostensibly "good" part.
GID00003210	If you're sure, I won't bring it up again. We can just go on our merry way, fighting injustice in our typical fashion.
GID00003211	Okay, I hear you. Forget I said anything. Consider it dropped.
GID00003212	A lot of different places. I only know what I was told. Some of them were cut down by the NCR and the Brotherhood. Some of them went east.
GID00003213	My mother never told me what happened to my father, but she and I went south with some others and integrated into the NCR.
GID00003214	When the NCR learned that Enclave personnel had integrated, we kept moving to the fringes. It's one of the reasons why I wound up out here.
GID00003215	After the Enclave's command structure fell apart, it was only a matter of time before Navarro was overrun by NCR forces.
GID00003216	My mother and I left with some of the troopers from my father's old unit, the same people I've kept in contact with over the years.
GID00003217	Anyone who didn't get out was killed by the NCR. Even some of the ones who escaped were eventually hunted down by the Brotherhood of Steel.
GID00003218	The Enclave did a lot of bad things, but there were good people at Navarro. Good people with a lot of experience.
GID00003219	Not many of them are alive anymore, but I think they could make a difference in the fight against Caesar.
GID00003220	That's a hard question to answer. I know I don't want the Legion to take Hoover Dam.
GID00003221	So militarily, yes, I want them to help NCR. If possible, I'd like to figure out a way to help the NCR win Hoover Dam without holding New Vegas.
GID00003222	Great! I'd like you to talk to the old-timers, the Remnants. I don't think I can convince them by myself. To them, I'm still a kid.
GID00003223	But you're a big part of what's happening out here. When you talk to them, they'll understand how important this all is.
GID00003224	I've kept in contact with them over the years, so I know where you can find them, but I doubt they'll open up to you unless I come along.
GID00003225	I know I'm not always the most serious guy around, but this means a lot to me. Thanks.
GID00003226	Oh. After spilling my guts to you, I wasn't expecting that kind of a response but... I understand.
GID00003227	If you change your mind, let me know. It would mean a lot to me.
GID00003228	What did you have in mind?
GID00003229	Do you now? If I didn't already owe you a great deal I'd be highly suspicious right now. You'll have to tell me about it sometime.
GID00003230	Here, I'll show you. It's easy, once you get used to it. First, we'll start with putting it on...
GID00003231	Not even close. Power armor isn't something you wear so much as use. It's a weapon in its own right, and takes skill to wield.
GID00003232	If you don't know what you're doing, you won't even be able to walk with it on. So how about a bit of quick instruction?
GID00003233	Standard practice. Rangers operate on our own most of the time. And that's how we like it.
GID00003234	Usually we call in our positions to McCarran to be relayed to other rangers, but I can handle myself.
GID00003235	I'm sure as hell not going to lose any sleep on account of a goddamn broken down radio. But it will shorten my stay if I can't fix it.
GID00003236	Criminal scum that've infested this region, attacking caravans and regular folk just passing through.
GID00003237	The dangerous ones are roamers, though there's another group that mostly stays put, over at the prison southwest of here.
GID00003238	The NCR mounted an attack not long ago but they just used regular troops - no rangers - so that didn't amount to anything.
GID00003239	Criminal scum that've infested this region, attacking caravans and regular folk just passing through.
GID00003240	The dangerous ones are roamers, though there's another group that mostly stays put, over at the prison southwest of here.
GID00003241	So far the brass haven't mustered up enough men to take the prison back. Long overdue if you ask me. But I'm just one man.
GID00003242	Criminal scum that've infested this region, attacking caravans and regular folk just passing through.
GID00003243	The dangerous ones are roamers, though there's another group that mostly stays put, over at the prison southwest of here.
GID00003244	Or so they did, 'til NCR brass finally mustered up enough troops to take out the trash. Wish I could've been there.
GID00003245	That is sad news, indeed, and I thank you for making your way here to convey it to us, but now the issue remains that an outsider knows our location.
GID00003246	I'm afraid that's not a possibility at the moment. Let's just say that your eventual safe departure from here relies on how forthcoming you are.
GID00003247	That said, I'd like you to tell me why you're here.
GID00003248	I applaud your commitment to your own word, though it saddens me to hear of the fate of our comrades.
GID00003249	Accident or no, we both now find ourselves in an uncomfortable situation.
GID00003250	Hey, what are you doing to my radio?
GID00003251	You just had to go messing with my radio again, didn't you?
GID00003252	Where do you come from that you haven't heard of the NCR? Nevermind, it doesn't matter much.
GID00003253	If you haven't heard of us, you must not be from the Legion. Put simply, the NCR is the greatest nation currently functioning.
GID00003254	Sure can. The NCR was founded from the survivors of one of the great Vaults. We started as a small settlement called Shady Sands.
GID00003255	We now consist of 5 states, that make up the greatest nation since the Great War.
GID00003256	Caesar's Legion.
GID00003257	A bunch of degenerate slavers, led by a madman who calls himself Caesar. Every one of them is a barbarian to the last.
GID00003258	I've even heard one of their leaders, the Legate or something, goes around with a human skull on his head. Savages to the last.
GID00003259	It is no secret. Our interest here is two fold.
GID00003260	First, we want to remain in control of Hoover Dam. It supplies the Republic with power, and is a source of fresh water.
GID00003261	Second, we want to prevent the Legion from advancing across the Colorado River and endangering the home states.
GID00003262	Pulling bullets out of a vengeance-crazed drifter is truly a noble step up from tending to the downtrodden of Freeside, but I think I'll pass.
GID00003263	The NCR had a chance to use the Followers' skills before, but being imperialists mattered more to them. No thanks.
GID00003264	That's funny. Mr. House doesn't want to keep New Vegas independent. He just wants to keep the NCR and Caesar's Legion from pushing him around.
GID00003265	He must be pretty convincing if he's roped you into helping him, but you can count me out.
GID00003266	If that's really what you're trying to do, I'll go with you.
GID00003267	Things are hectic around here, but it won't mean anything if NCR or the Legion take control. I'm sure the Followers can manage without me.
GID00003268	Just don't try to help the Legion, and we shouldn't have any problems. Sound good?
GID00003269	Only because everyone would be conscripted or enslaved. And the people who are unfit for military service or slavery would be put down. Swell plan.
GID00003270	Yes, a veritable Pax Romana for post-nuclear America. My political beliefs are a bit more progressive than outright fascism, so I'll pass. Thanks.
GID00003271	Hmm. That seems appropriately resolute and yet vague. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and go with you, but let me be clear about something.
GID00003272	If you plan to help Caesar's Legion, this is going to be a brief relationship.
GID00003273	I may not have all the answers for how to fix Freeside's problems, but Caesar taking control isn't part of the solution. Fair?
GID00003274	Hmm. Wow. You sound like you really do need some help. Look, I can help you out, but you can't do anything stu-
GID00003275	I mean, you can't... help bad people, who want to hurt the locals in Freeside. If you do, I'll leave. Does that make sense?
GID00003276	Yes. The Followers do not like Caesar or Caesar's Legion. You should also not like them. If you do, you like hurting people and that is bad. Goodbye.
GID00003277	Uh... probably not. Until things settle down around here, alleviating my boredom isn't a good motive to leave. Sorry.
GID00003278	All right. Let's not waste any time. There are people out there to help, things to learn. Maybe not in that order, but let's get to it.
GID00003279	I'm not sure why you thought a Follower would want to help Caesar after all of the misery he's visited on us and the people we try to help.
GID00003280	Well, good luck to you in your future endeavors, assuming they don't involve Caesar.
GID00003281	Overt flirtation will get you everywhere, you know.
GID00003282	On a slightly more serious note, if you're interested in helping out with the troubles plaguing Freeside, I can come with you.
GID00003283	Just don't do anything obnoxious, like trying to help Caesar's Legion, and we should be fine. Understood?
GID00003284	Plasma rifles. They were intended to replace the P94 plasma caster.
GID00003285	There was some corporate espionage going on between Poseidon Energy's Project SEMELE and whatever was going on here.
GID00003286	REPCONN went through some rough times. When their rocket business was shaky, Mr. House purchased the company.
GID00003287	It didn't take long for him to repurpose their plasma technology for a government weapon contract.
GID00003288	Another one of Poseidon Energy's many secret weapons projects. Before the Great War. It didn't go anywhere.
GID00003289	That's how REPCONN got their shot. So to speak.
GID00003290	Me, specifically? No. I'm sure Julie Farkas does, though. Lab coat, pointy hair. Answers to the name "Julie Farkas," strangely enough.
GID00003291	I'm sure she can find something for you to do. It might be kind of... depressing and terrible, though. Caveat Samaritanus.
GID00003292	Personally, no. But thanks to you, Julie says we're a lot better off these days. I'll take her word for it. So, thanks.
GID00003293	See you around.
GID00003294	Well I don't. I'm sure there were a few people turning a blind eye, but can you blame them?
GID00003295	NCR's sharecropper farms had all of the water. The nearest fresh source is the lake, and that's a bit of a hike.
GID00003296	I do say so. The Followers aren't a military organization. If anyone knew what he was up to, they weren't talking.
GID00003297	And if they knew he was stealing water, so what? Westside has more of a right to that water than the NCR.
GID00003298	Of course.
GID00003299	Neither did Anderson.
GID00003300	I guess that means you don't have to apologize to all of the people in Westside you just screwed over.
GID00003301	In case you weren't paying attention, you killed the only person who ever gave a damn about them.
GID00003302	Fantastic. Now the only influential person who gave a damn about Westside is gone. Great job.
GID00003303	In case I'm not laying down enough sarcasm, you just screwed up the lives of a bunch of struggling people.
GID00003304	Huh. Good question. Must have been in a book.
GID00003305	Uh, what does anyone know about them? Big... flying machines, right? Crazy helicopters. So weird.
GID00003306	Yes, I know the loss of the patrols has weighed heavily on his mind for some time. He took it very personally when they first went missing.
GID00003307	That was when I first began to seriously question his ability to lead us. A commander has to be able to deal with the potential loss of his men.
GID00003308	It's strange that he would ask you to find mission discs on them, however. The missing paladins were all on standard patrols, which don't need them.
GID00003309	Only Brothers sent on special assignments are given mission discs. If you should find any on the lost patrols, let me know.
GID00003310	That's a sensible notion. Your familiarity with the nearby terrain makes you perfect as a liason.
GID00003311	I've been trying to get the Elder to send out scouts for years, and he's always been resistant to the idea. Said they'd be a vulnerability.
GID00003312	I wonder what changed his mind.
GID00003313	The filtration system? He wouldn't have you looking if we didn't need those parts badly, which means that system's in real trouble.
GID00003314	If the air filters go, it will become impossible to breathe down here. We'd be forced to evacuate the bunker!
GID00003315	I can't believe he's kept something like this to himself! We should have every able-bodied person in the chapter working on this.
GID00003316	All the more reason for you to find a way to get McNamara out of that chair, before he dooms us all.
GID00003317	If you must.
GID00003318	Just as I thought, McNamara gave my men new orders without telling me. The nerve of that man!
GID00003319	This little stunt is probably what got them killed in the first place. Our normal patrol routes are known to be relatively safe.
GID00003320	This is exactly what I've been looking for! McNamara gave my men new orders without telling me, thereby breaking the Chain That Binds!
GID00003321	With this, I can finally have him removed as Elder, and end this ridiculous lockdown.
GID00003322	This is exactly the kind of thing I'm trying to avoid by ousting McNamara.
GID00003323	I could hardly call myself Head Paladin if I didn't. It's one of the first things every initiate learns when they start training. What about it?
GID00003324	I could be wrong, but I think that's a dead end. McNamara's always followed orders, and we've been incommunicado since fleeing HELIOS.
GID00003325	Second part? What are you talking about?
GID00003326	Then that means I can cast McNamara down for giving those secret orders to my Paladins! Well done! That's exactly what I was looking for!
GID00003327	That is the standard procedure, yes. For example, McNamara gives orders to Head Scribe Taggart, who then relays further orders to the scribes.
GID00003328	I wasn't aware that failing to do so was punishable, however. Interesting...
GID00003329	If we can just find an instance where McNamara went around someone and gave orders to their subordinates, we'll have him.
GID00003330	...So now I'm going to have your death on my conscience, too. Great.
GID00003331	You think you're the first person the Elder's trusted with this? He sent three of our patrols out looking for those components, and they're all dead.
GID00003332	I was the one who supplied the Elder with the location of possible sites where we could find the components, so their deaths are my fault.
GID00003333	And now it's your turn. Well, don't say you weren't warned. I won't take the blame when you die horribly. But I can tell you're getting impatient.
GID00003334	No, I heard you quite clearly. You're being sent off to be killed like the others.
GID00003335	The items I'll need to keep the system running are a differential pressure controller, a reverse pulse cleaner, and several HEPA cartridge filters.
GID00003336	At present, my best guess for finding the items would be to search any of the old vaults in the area.
GID00003337	Those vaults were usually built much like these military bunkers, even using the same contractors in their constructions at times.
GID00003338	I'll mark the vaults' locations on your map. Best of luck to you.
GID00003339	Really? I mean, that's great! I knew you could do it all along. I'll get right to work installing these.
GID00003340	Why don't you go tell the Elder the good news. I'm sure it'll be a huge load off of his shoulders.
GID00003341	It's amazing that you've found any of them and not gotten gruesomely mangled. Keep up the good work!
GID00003342	I don't want to rush you or anything, but time is of the essence. Please try to find those components as soon as you can.
GID00003343	Sure, what about?
GID00003344	You're a strange one, aren'tcha? Fine, what did you want to talk about?
GID00003345	A Brotherhood base? Here? Are you shitting me? No one's seen them for years.
GID00003346	I don't suppose you've got a scrap of evidence to support this wild-eyed claim of yours?
GID00003347	I'll be. Let me take a look at that.
GID00003348	All this is, is a slave collar. Seen plenty of these infernal contraptions in my day, and I know just how to spring 'em. Hold still.
GID00003349	There, it's off. Now thing is, a slave collar seems a little too basic for the Brotherhood.
GID00003350	That's not to say I don't believe you, bu- did you just hear something?
GID00003351	I'll be. Let me take a look at that.
GID00003352	All this is, is a slave collar. Seen plenty of these infernal contraptions in my day, and I know just how to spring 'em. Hold still.
GID00003353	There, it's off. Now thing is, a slave collar seems a little too basic for the Brotherhood.
GID00003354	That's not to say I don't believe you, just that maybe you got your facts mixed up a little. Let's head back to my camp and go over what you saw.
GID00003355	I've been trying to get that damn thing working for days, and you decided to just start tinkering with it? Let me see that.
GID00003356	[SUCCEEDED] I've been trying to get that damn thing working for days, and you think you fixed it in a few minutes? Let me see that.
GID00003357	[FAILED] The hell you did. I know enough about electronics to know that what you were doing wasn't fixing it.
GID00003358	So I'll give you one more chance to tell me what you were doing.
GID00003359	Okay, but if I find you messing with it again, there'll be hell to pay, you hear me?
GID00003360	Didn't look like nothing to me. Draw!
GID00003361	Just kidding. You weren't doing any harm that I could see. So what do you think? Can it be fixed?
GID00003362	Didn't look like nothing to me. Draw!
GID00003363	Well, at least you're man enough to admit it. Now get the hell out of here. If I see you again, it'll be through my rifle's sight.
GID00003364	Oh? And in your expert opinion, why would that be?
GID00003365	[SUCCEEDED] You've seen that with your own two eyes?
GID00003366	Goddamn, I knew Cooke's gang passed through these parts 'bout that frequently, but I didn't know they holed up here.
GID00003367	Be a rude awakening, to find fifteen of those merciless bastards looking down at me snoozing on my bedroll!
GID00003368	Yep, I'd be better off setting up an ambush along one of their routes to catch stragglers. Thanks for the information. You may've saved my life.
GID00003369	[FAILED] See now, thing is, I fancy myself a bit of a tracker. And I don't see much in the way of tracks 'round here.
GID00003370	Could say that's on account of the dust storms. But if there were criminals using these bunkers as hideouts, I'd know.
GID00003371	I see. Well, I'll take that under advisement.
GID00003372	Now why would I do that? You see some powder gangers on the approach or something?
GID00003373	The desert can play tricks on a man's mind. Don't let it bother you overmuch.
GID00003374	What? Let me see that.
GID00003375	What? That's great. I'll have to check it out when I head back tonight.
GID00003376	Well, you'd have to get a senior-level member of the chapter to unlock a topic for you. I've given you access to what I can, but that's not much.
GID00003377	The majority of topics fall under Ramos's aegis, since they'd constitute a security risk. Good luck getting anything out of him.
GID00003378	You might have better luck with another member of the senior staff. Try talking to them about it.
GID00003379	Yes, you exploited his fear of Powder Gangers very effectively. The collar includes a microphone, you see. Part of the test.
GID00003380	He'll keep his distance, setting ambushes, never suspecting that these bunkers house something far more dangerous to him than criminals. Well-played.
GID00003381	I see. And he's not particularly likely to come back, since he's learned that the bunkers here aren't secure enough to serve as safehouses.
GID00003382	It's not a foolproof solution, but indirect methods rarely are. What matters is that you drove him off without alerting him to our presence.
GID00003383	I would like you to find the components we need to fix this bunker's air filtration system. I cannot overstate the importance of this task.
GID00003384	See Senior Knight Lorenzo for the details. He's the one who brought the matter to my attention, and the only other person who is aware of it.
GID00003385	The device that creates the sandstorms above, that masks our comings and goings, was only intended to be used in case of emergencies.
GID00003386	It was never meant to be used with any regularity, and the other systems here were not designed to accommodate such usage.
GID00003387	In particular, the air filtration system simply cannot handle the quantity of sand and grit that it's been forced to cope with these last few years.
GID00003388	As a result, the system is failing, albeit slowly. I'm told we have scant few months before it shuts down completely.
GID00003389	Should that happen, it will quickly become impossible to breathe here in the bunker. Already the air quality begins to slightly worsen.
GID00003390	That's an old, old principle that's been around since the Brotherhood was founded. It basically means that you have to obey a superior officer.
GID00003391	It's pretty much common sense, but it gets invoked a lot when people get pissy about following orders.
GID00003392	If you're curious, I'll give you access to the datastore entry on it. You'd probably be the first to read it in years, if not decades.
GID00003393	That elevator is nowhere, baby. Step over to the mic.
GID00003394	I don't know what they're up to and I don't want to know. I just hope no harm comes to Novac.
GID00003395	Not much to live off of around here, except salvage from that factory. If they made off with anything expensive, we'd be hurting something fierce.
GID00003396	But I will say this. If all of 'em turned up dead tomorrow, I couldn't see as to how they'd be missed.
GID00003397	That might even be a desirable thing, knowing the town was safe from the likes of them. There'd be a reward in it if some brave soul made it happen.
GID00003398	Whatever suits you.
GID00003399	Yeah, go on.
GID00003400	Wow, this is our first hot streak since we opened this place back up! Here's a little something, on the house.
GID00003401	You're doing great! Keep on spending money, hopefully we'll get some extra action in here.
GID00003402	You're the luckiest player I've ever seen. Keep up the good work in here.
GID00003403	I'm sorry, you've done so much good stuff for us here in Primm, but we just can't afford to lose any more money to you.
GID00003404	I can't let you play here anymore.
GID00003405	This concludes our firing test of the ARCHIMEDES I and II laser systems. Thank you for observing Poseidon Energy safety protocol. Have a nice day.
GID00003406	ARCHIMEDES II orbital laser bombardment will commence in T-minus 5... 4... 3... 2... 1.
GID00003407	Warning. Retargeting sequence initiated for HELIOS One reflector banks.
GID00003408	The ARCHIMEDES laser systems will automatically initiate test fire upon completion.
GID00003409	Attention. ARCHIMEDES I Laser is now armed. Move all personnel to minimum safe distance before initiating test fire.
GID00003410	He's here? Bless you, I thought he was a goner for sure.
GID00003411	Listen, you do what you gotta do to find him. I'd send my men with you but I'm worried they'd kill Ted if we got close.
GID00003412	Reckon you might need one of these. Take it. Just don't wave it around here where they might take it from you.
GID00003413	Confound it. I knew I shoulda stayed with him. Ted, I'm so sorry, boy.
GID00003414	I demand to know who did this!
GID00003415	Well I reckon he could be a sheriff if you have the skills to reprogram him.
GID00003416	Well I guess I never thought of that. I guess he could be sheriff, if you think he could be reprogrammed for it.
GID00003417	Yeah, that sounds alright to me. I bet we can find someone to do his work for that much. Tell him to get going.
GID00003418	Caesar's death is regrettable, but we can't let it stand in the way of the Legion's goals.
GID00003419	Our scouts have reported that the NCR's President Kimball will be visiting the Dam. This is an excellent opportunity to assassinate him.
GID00003420	You are to meet with Cato Hostilius - he'll have more information on ways to eliminate Kimball.
GID00003421	Yes, we can't let Caesar's death get in the way of the Legion's goals.
GID00003422	Our scouts have reported that the NCR's President Kimball will be visiting the Dam. This is an excellent opportunity to assassinate him.
GID00003423	You are to meet with Cato Hostilius - he'll have more information on ways to eliminate Kimball.
GID00003424	We'll see about that. In any case, we can't let Caesar's death get in the way of the Legion's goals.
GID00003425	Our scouts have reported that the NCR's President Kimball will be visiting the Dam. This is an excellent opportunity to assassinate him.
GID00003426	You are to meet with Cato Hostilius - he'll have more information on ways to eliminate Kimball.
GID00003427	Great Khans! Drive Caesar's dog out of our camp! If he's too slow to flee, kill him!
GID00003428	Hey, you're the one who's been going around helping people around here, right? The King says to keep up the good work, and said to give you this.
GID00003429	You're starting to get quite the reputation around here, aren't you? Don't get me wrong, I'm not passing judgement or anything.
GID00003430	The fine proprietors of Mick & Ralph's appreciate that kind of attitude, and would like to offer you a discount on their fine wares.
GID00003431	Just as long as you keep making waves, that is. Be seeing you.
GID00003432	Give me all of your ca- whoa, I'm sorry. I-I didn't know it was you. Please don't hurt me. I've got a wife! And kids! And pets and stuff!
GID00003433	Smooth and easy, just the way I like it. Don't worry, they'll be as safe as kittens till you're ready to leave.
GID00003434	Oh, and a friendly word of advice: if you happen to "stumble across" any weapons during your stay here, well... just don't wear them openly. You dig?
GID00003435	Now that we got that little business out of the way, what can I do to make your Tops experience the tops?
GID00003436	Pleasure doing business with you.
GID00003437	The Courier, fair and even-handed in her dealings throughout the Wasteland, was honored by the NCR for her support of the military at Hoover Dam.
GID00003438	She was presented with the Golden Branch, the highest civilian decoration given by the Republic.
GID00003439	Though the Courier's agenda was a mystery to many, she was honored by NCR for her support of the military at Hoover Dam.
GID00003440	She was presented with the Golden Branch, the highest civilian decoration given by the Republic.
GID00003441	With brutal methods that few in NCR would approve of, it was the Courier who secured NCR's victory at Hoover Dam.
GID00003442	Despite her extreme actions, she was awarded with the Golden Branch, the highest civilian decoration given by the Republic.
GID00003443	Though the Courier herself was just and forthright in her dealings throughout the Wasteland, she helped the Legion achieve victory.
GID00003444	Caesar honored her with a golden coin, minted in celebration of her contributions and distributed throughout the wasteland.
GID00003445	The Courier, a mercenary at heart, helped the Legion achieve victory at Hoover Dam.
GID00003446	Caesar honored her with a golden coin, minted in celebration of her contributions and distributed throughout the wasteland.
GID00003447	The Legion marched over the Hoover Dam with the help of one who was as brutal and merciless as the worst of them: The Courier.
GID00003448	Caesar honored her with a golden coin, minted in celebration of her contributions and distributed throughout the wasteland.
GID00003449	The Courier, fair and kind-hearted to those in the Wasteland, ensured that Mr. House would keep New Vegas stable and secure for future generations.
GID00003450	Mr. House afforded her every luxury at his disposal in the Lucky 38, both out of gratitude and a quiet pride in his choice of lieutenants.
GID00003451	The Courier, who had a mixed history in the Wasteland, kept the status quo at Hoover Dam.
GID00003452	Mr. House kept New Vegas stable, if not free, for generations, and afforded the Courier every luxury at his disposal in the Lucky 38.
GID00003453	The Courier, cruel and merciless, had ensured that Mr. House would maintain complete control over New Vegas and everyone in it.
GID00003454	Mr. House afforded her every luxury at his disposal in the Lucky 38, mostly as a reward, but partly out of fear.
GID00003455	Supporting the ideals of independence, the Courier was recognized as the woman responsible for a truly free New Vegas.
GID00003456	She ensured that Mr. House's tyranny was broken and that neither Caesar's Legion nor NCR would ever gain control over New Vegas.
GID00003457	Preferring neither the best of the NCR nor the worst of the Legion, the Courier was the woman responsible for a truly independent New Vegas.
GID00003458	She had removed Mr. House from power over the Strip and broken the influence of the NCR and Caesar's Legion in the Mojave Wasteland.
GID00003459	Supporting all of the chaos that comes with independence, the Courier was the woman responsible for a truly free New Vegas.
GID00003460	She ensured the fall of Mr. House and the end of the Legion's and NCR's influence over New Vegas.
GID00003461	The last person stupid enough to follow me down this alley. Get this fool, boys!
GID00003462	Nah, just some idiot that wandered down the wrong alley. Sound familiar?
GID00003463	What's your rush? The boys and I here want to get to know you better.
GID00003464	Get him!
GID00003465	Get her!
GID00003466	Don't think everyone around here is going to tolerate your actions, outsider. A few of us have a mind to put you down like the animal you are.
GID00003467	If I or one of the others hears that you're topside, we might just come out and have a little chat.
GID00003468	You may have questionable methods, outsider, but some of us realize you get the job done.
GID00003469	We've talked Torres into giving you access to gear for a little cheaper, to help out with your travels. Hope it helps!
GID00003470	There you are! A few of us wanted to thank you for being such a good friend to the Brotherhood, so we've set aside some of our recycled energy cells.
GID00003471	We'll leave a few of them in that footlocker in the corner every so often. The Paladins scoff at using recycled ammo, so no one should mind.
GID00003472	Well, ain't we all, right? That was a long time ago. I don't pay it much mind anymore.
GID00003473	Yep. He sure did. Wanted himself a hotel, and to make sure once he made the change there'd never be any going back.
GID00003474	We didn't get a say. Don't know how you'd argue with a fella like that anyways, everywhere and nowhere all at once.
GID00003475	So just like that, we was all homeless. Went our separate ways, and that was all she wrote.
GID00003476	Eventually we made our way out here. But uh...
GID00003477	Well, when folks spend their lives in isolation, sometimes that ain't the best of things for learning to fight off germs.
GID00003478	We was going to California, but Goodsprings was as far as we got. After she passed, wasn't no reason to keep going.
GID00003479	I stayed so I could keep close to her.
GID00003480	What'd you have in mind?
GID00003481	Waited too long to finish this, last loose end, all wrapped up.
GID00003482	Really. We'll see about that.
GID00003483	You know what, I think you mean that. All right... maybe...
GID00003484	Dead? What... by you? Yeah, I can tell, you had something to do with it.
GID00003485	Gloria was right about you. You take care of business before it's a problem.
GID00003486	Really. NCR all around her.
GID00003487	Well, tell you what. You find a way to bring her here. She'll want to hear what I have to say.
GID00003488	What? You two on the outs? Ain't that a shame.
GID00003489	Guess you misheard me - I wasn't asking you a question. Find a way to get her here.
GID00003490	If you can't bring her here, then make sure she never leaves the Outpost, and that's fine with me.
GID00003491	Fuck, no. If I knew where this bitch was, do you think I'd be asking you?
GID00003492	Still, there's someone who might - old Alice McLafferty, Crimson Caravan, might know something.
GID00003493	She keeps tabs on caravan traffic in the Mojave, wouldn't put it past her to keep track of Cassidy Caravans and its owner.
GID00003494	I had nothing to do with that, and neither did anyone here. Now where would you have gotten an idea like that?
GID00003495	I got business here, need to watch the shop, make sure things are running - smoothly.
GID00003496	Besides, if I came for the girl, I'm not all friendly and charming like you are. She might get the wrong idea.
GID00003497	You don't want us chatting, trust me. As for the girl - I just want to talk to her.
GID00003498	And if you can't bring her here, you're no use to me - or Gloria. So if you want to cause trouble in here over nothing, then go on - try.
GID00003499	If your answer isn't "yes, I'll bring her here" or "no, I won't, cause Gloria had me pegged wrong," then we're done here.
GID00003500	So, looks like we have us a thief. All right, guess I'm talking to you instead of the girl.
GID00003501	And after all the trouble I went through to kill all those witnesses. Guess now I have one more than I thought.
GID00003502	"Nowhere's" a strange place to get an idea like that.
GID00003503	You know what, you're new. Gloria's not going to miss you. And I'm not going to risk you saying the same thing to that bitch I'm hunting for.
GID00003504	Guess Gloria was wrong about you, then. Get out of here, you're no use to me.
GID00003505	Good, getting tired of questions from you when I should be getting answers. Bring her here.
GID00003506	Tabitha! You naughty, naughty girl! Leo remembers what you did!
GID00003507	Tabitha was grandma's squad leader when we both worked for the Master. She wasn't very nice at all, but she was good at the chopping.
GID00003508	Almost as good as Leo....
GID00003509	Indeed I do good sir, and I would be thrilled to share that information with you as soon as I am released from captivity.
GID00003510	My good lady, I believe I may have some information that would prove useful.
GID00003511	If you would just untie my hands I'd be more than happy to share what information I have with you.
GID00003512	I'm in quite a state here. If you help me with my bonds I'll be more than happy to tell you anything, and everything about those Khans.
GID00003513	Ahh yes, my memory is much clearer now that I am free from my bondage.
GID00003514	I was sku... er, performing recon, gathering information on some of the Powder Gangers, when some great Khans arrived with your friend in the suit.
GID00003515	They were talking about some delivery they took from a courier, I assume that was you.
GID00003516	They said they'd be heading through Nipton to Novac to meet a contact there.
GID00003517	I overheard them saying that they are on their way to Novac. If you want to follow them I strongly suggest that you follow the road through Nipton.
GID00003518	There are a lot of dangerous things out in the desert, and you won't have me with you to protect you, as I need to stay here and keep Primm safe.
GID00003519	[SUCCEEDED] Well, you look to be the trustworthy sort. Okay, I'll tell you what I know.
GID00003520	[FAILED] I'm sure you mean well, but I'm afraid you'll have to wait until I'm in a calmer emotional state before my memory is going to function.
GID00003521	Oh, you know. Finding alternative treatments for common illnesses and injuries. Stimpaks out of barrel cacti and other fantastic improbabilities.
GID00003522	As far as fruitless wastes of time go, it's quite noble in its aims.
GID00003523	Not all Followers are "people persons." Besides, someone needs to do research. I have no problem with Julie sticking me back here.
GID00003524	Out of sight, out of mind. There are worse things one can be, though I do admit, it is a bit boring.
GID00003525	Though it has a noble goal, I don't think this research will yield much fruit. No pun intended.
GID00003526	Like I said before, not all Followers are good with people.
GID00003527	I'm fine doing research back here, even if it is a bit boring... and pointless... and a complete waste of time.
GID00003528	Don't mind me. I'm just voicing my thoughts so they don't burrow out of my skull in a fit of abject despondency.
GID00003529	I'm enthusiastic about helping people, but nihil novi sub sole.
GID00003530	For the past hundred years or so, the Followers have managed to get by using salvaged medical supplies from the Old World.
GID00003531	But the side effect of medical success is that more people live longer. Funny how that works.
GID00003532	Eventually, we'll run out of hospitals to loot. We need new ways to produce those supplies. Or maybe old ways, if this research goes anywhere.
GID00003533	Cuts, lacerations, broken bones. Infections resulting from all of the above. Common cold, influenza. Take your pick.
GID00003534	There are plenty of ways to die out here, and most of them, surprisingly, don't have anything to do with war. Just common human fragility.
GID00003535	Caesar can cite Cato to suit his purpose. Many people have spoken Latin. Some of them were quite pleasant.
GID00003536	It's unfortunate that the language is now associated with the gentlemen across the river.
GID00003537	Oh. Sorry. "There is nothing new under the sun."
GID00003538	If agave and mesquite were that miraculous, the locals would have figured it out a few thousand years ago.
GID00003539	Not from the Legion, if that's what you're getting at. Books. Sheet music. Gladiator movie holotapes. Bits and pieces here and there.
GID00003540	The Followers have extensive libraries, but we all draw water from the same old well. Even Caesar.
GID00003541	I don't know anything that the others couldn't tell you. Caesar was one of the Followers. Before my time, of course.
GID00003542	He wanted to rebuild the new world in the image of the old. A sad story of good intentions gone bad. In that regard, he's hardly unique.
GID00003543	If you set aside his leadership capabilities, extensive knowledge, and ruthless cunning, he's just another jerk who steps on people to get his way.
GID00003544	I can't leave now. Caesar has gained too much ground. I need to be here in case the NCR fails to hold Hoover Dam.
GID00003545	No offense intended, but why should I go anywhere with you?
GID00003546	Energy weapons? Of course not.
GID00003547	I mean... but, we study all sorts of science and technology so, you know, we... you just kind of get familiar with them. Yeah.
GID00003548	Oh, uh... of hearing stories. About energy weapons. They're... pretty crazy. Yeah.
GID00003549	Did I say something? Sorry. Don't pay any attention to me. Just babbling. Nonsense, really. Babbling nonsense.
GID00003550	Very optimistic of you. You'll make a good Follower someday assuming Caesar doesn't have us both crucified.
GID00003551	Short of canceling our imminent travel plans, that's the best thing you could have said.
GID00003552	Just be careful. If we travel at Caesar's pleasure, he may not let us out as easily as he lets us in.
GID00003553	Et tu, mi amice?
GID00003554	Et tu, mi amica?
GID00003555	I have to commend you on your sense of historical propriety, but have you given more than a passing thought to how we would escape?
GID00003556	No disrespect intended, but you aren't the first person to dream up the idea.
GID00003557	Just give me a sign when you're about to pull out the dagger so I know when to make a run for the cliffs.
GID00003558	I can't say I understand your obsession, but for that I suppose I'd have to spend a night in your grave.
GID00003559	Fine. I'll stick with you. Just remember this. If you want something from Caesar, sooner or later you'll have to give him his due.
GID00003560	I can't see as how I'd charge you after the generous things you've done for the town. The room's on me.
GID00003561	Well, I think that's a fine idea. I'll give you a good flat rate, and you can stay as long as you like. Least till the busy season comes. Sound good?
GID00003562	I'm glad you can stay with us.
GID00003563	Well that's nothing to be ashamed of. We all have money troubles from time to time.
GID00003564	You just come on back when you can afford it, and that room's all yours.
GID00003565	Oh. Well, all right.
GID00003566	Your room will be the one upstairs, closest to the lobby side.
GID00003567	Here's your key. Let me know if there's anything I can do to make your stay better for you.
GID00003568	Even if that were the case, we still need more incentive to help Vegas.
GID00003569	I think I see now what you intend to set in motion.
GID00003570	If this plan will bring us one step closer to revitalizing the region, you can count on our support.
GID00003571	So long as you can keep us supplied, we will stay in the Mojave to provide care and education for those in need.
GID00003572	See ya.
GID00003573	Then'll we have to make you leave by force. Your own fault, you understand.
GID00003574	This is most unusual! The Powder Gangers have visitors today. I guess there's a first for everything!
GID00003575	Now those tough-looking fellows must be Great Khans. I recognize those funny helmets and leather vests from stories I've heard...
GID00003576	So what are they doing with that dapper gentleman who wears a checked suit? I wouldn't mind a suit like that.
GID00003577	They're talking about heading south toward Nipton, then west to Novac where they'll meet up with someone...
GID00003578	I guess I could track them if I needed to, but the town of Primm needs me here, to serve and protect.
GID00003579	Oh my. I think I've been spotted...
GID00003580	Mr. House ran projections on how the NCR public will react to a defeat at Hoover Dam! Overwhelmingly, they'll blame Kimball!
GID00003581	But if Kimball dies at Hoover Dam, there's no obvious scapegoat for them to blame! So they'll blame New Vegas instead!
GID00003582	So that means reduced tourism for up to five years! The equations are pretty complicated! Mr. House sure liked numbers!
GID00003583	Great! A Ranger named Grant has been placed in charge of security for the President's visit. You'll want to talk to him.
GID00003584	Once the President is safe, there's one more thing for you to take care of!
GID00003585	All right. A Ranger named Grant is in charge of security for the visit. He's the one you'll have to convince.
GID00003586	After you've resolved the situation with the President, there's one more thing for you to take care of!
GID00003587	You are so misunderstood! Well, it's their loss!
GID00003588	Forget about the President! We've got something more important to take care of!
GID00003589	Fine by me! We've got more important things to take care of!
GID00003590	Great! When this is taken care of, we'll be all set for the Legion to make its move.
GID00003591	I'll use the Substation to send a huge jolt of electricity to the Lucky 38! Turns out this casino has its own reactor! All it needs is a jumpstart!
GID00003592	With the reactor running at full-tilt, I can boost the transmission strength of the Lucky 38's command and control network!
GID00003593	Be careful out there! It won't be long before the Legion makes its move!
GID00003594	What? Are you crazy?
GID00003595	What the-? Don't touch me. I could get a better massage from a baby.
GID00003596	Who are you, again?
GID00003597	You're weird. Please stop that.
GID00003598	Huh? Hey, I think you dropped your gun there. Here. Here you go. Just don't point it at me, okay?
GID00003599	I'm paranoid now, and even though you clearly don't know how to hold that thing, it'd be one less thing for me to worry about. Thanks.
GID00003600	Why it's splendid. Simply to die for.
GID00003601	Mortimer told me about you, you know. What a pair of mischief makers you two are!
GID00003602	But the new entrees are fresh and bold and I have the two of you to thank for it.
GID00003603	Now that it's been accepted, it will become a regular course for us.
GID00003604	It's a new and exciting frontier for our chef. I've never seen him so cheerful.
GID00003605	Oh, I very much doubt that. What fun would it be if everyone could have it?
GID00003606	Then again, I wouldn't be surprised if our chef used it here and there as a secret ingredient to make his dishes really come alive.
GID00003607	I wonder if Marcus knows about this place....
GID00003608	Ahh! Loud! Onetwothreefourfivesixseveneightninetenonetwothreefourfivesixseveneightnineten!
GID00003609	Nice puppies - do doggies want treats?
GID00003610	Ooh, look, pumpkin! A dinosaur! Do you want to ride the dinosaur?
GID00003611	My, aren't all these lights fancy?
GID00003612	My, my, this reminds me of when I was a girl. Right over there would have been where your grandpa and I had our first kiss!
GID00003613	Step closer to the demonstration area, please!
GID00003614	Okay, so you're familiar with Securitrons by now, obviously! I mean, some of your best friends are Securitrons, right?
GID00003615	Our titanium alloy housing does a good job of protecting our delicate electronic insides from small arms fire and shrapnel!
GID00003616	Our left arm contains an X-25 gatling laser, quite deadly against soft targets at medium range. That looks like fun!
GID00003617	And for close-range suppression and crowd control, we have this handy-dandy 9mm submachinegun! Nice!
GID00003618	All of this is old hat, right?
GID00003619	Here's where it gets interesting! Turns out those are our secondary weapons!
GID00003620	All this time we've been running the Mark I operating system, which doesn't have drivers for our primary weapons! Imagine!
GID00003621	Now watch this - I'm downloading the Mark II OS to all the Securitrons on the network. Makes quite a difference!
GID00003622	With the M-235 Missile Launcher, we can engage ground and air targets at long range!
GID00003623	And a rapid-fire G-28 grenade launching system makes us deadly in close-range engagements! Whoo, look at that!
GID00003624	The OS upgrade also includes drivers for our onboard auto-repair systems! Just try to hurt us now!
GID00003625	All together, this software upgrade confers a 235% increase in combat effectiveness - per unit!
GID00003626	New Vegas finally has soldiers worthy of protecting it!
GID00003627	I hope you enjoyed this demonstration! You can come back up and see me or be on your way - I know you're a busy person!
GID00003628	Okay, but I'd really like to take a look at him. Remember, I'll be able to give his armor some extra plating while I've got him here.
GID00003629	I've heard through our channels that it has some research that may be related to Enclave and Poseidon Energy technology.
GID00003630	I'd like to get what I can from it and use that data for the good of humanity... ALL of humanity, unlike the Brotherhood.
GID00003631	First I'm going to pull off whatever log data I can. Then, I'll use some of the tech around here to upgrade its weapons systems.
GID00003632	Shouldn't be more than a few days work.
GID00003633	Thank you. I'll get it back to you as soon as I can with the upgraded weapons systems.
GID00003634	The Brotherhood is all about keeping technology to themselves, and using what they find to protect themselves.
GID00003635	They are isolationist and belligerent. I have no doubt that they plan to use the data for weapons research.
GID00003636	Well, the Legion is going to attack Hoover Dam one of these days! And the NCR is going to defend it!
GID00003637	One side will lose, and the other will win! But the side that wins will be weak, because a lot of its soldiers will be dead!
GID00003638	That's when all our Securitrons will show up! We'll declare an Independent Vegas, and tell the side that won the dam - to scram!
GID00003639	Or the Securitrons will kill all of them, too!
GID00003640	Sure, no problem! So long as the Legion doesn't attack before you can get there! Which I'm sure they won't!
GID00003641	Wonderful! I'll keep tabs on the situation at the dam! See you in a bit!
GID00003642	Great! So I've been looking over Mr. House's force projections and running some calculations...
GID00003643	It turns out there are two ways we can win this thing! Hear that? We have options!
GID00003644	Great! So I've been looking over Mr. House's force projections and running some calculations...
GID00003645	It turns out there's only one way for us to win this battle and make it stick! We have to render Hoover Dam inoperable!
GID00003646	You could rout the dam's power output to the facility under Fortification Hill. That'll restart its reactor, just like you did with the Lucky 38!
GID00003647	That'll wake up the Securitron army you left on standby and give us enough force to push the Legion and the NCR straight out of the Mojave!
GID00003648	The other option is destroy the dam's generators. Without those, it's just a big bunch of concrete! The NCR won't have any reason to stick around!
GID00003649	You don't have to decide yet! For now, all you have to do is take this override module and install it on the terminal in the power control room!
GID00003650	Good luck! See you at the dam!
GID00003651	I wish I could, but I'm neuro-computationally incapable of making decisions like this one! It's up to you!
GID00003652	You remember how the Securitron army at the Fort got destroyed? For very, very good reasons, of course...
GID00003653	Well, the problem is that's left us with enough Securitrons to drive off a weakened NCR force - but not enough to keep them from coming back!
GID00003654	So what we do is take away the whole reason why they'd want to come back! Smart, huh?
GID00003655	That's exactly why this will work! Just hear me out...
GID00003656	Not the whole thing, thank goodness! That'd be really hard!
GID00003657	All you have to do is destroy the power generators! Without the generators, Hoover Dam's just a big bunch of concrete!
GID00003658	Take this override module - it's just like the one you used at the El Dorado Substation.
GID00003659	Install the override module on the terminal in the power control room! I'll disable the generator failsafes, and you can do the rest.
GID00003660	Good luck! See you at the dam!
GID00003661	Here, take a look at this print-out. It covers all the details!
GID00003662	This print-out describes the situation in more detail!
GID00003663	Take this print-out. It'll tell you what to do!
GID00003664	Here's another one of my print-outs! Read up!
GID00003665	This print-out covers everything you need to know!
GID00003666	Take a look at this print-out. I may have said things wrong a moment ago.
GID00003667	Here's a print-out with some additional information.
GID00003668	Who am I to argue with a solution like that?
GID00003669	If you say so, that's good enough for me!
GID00003670	All right, I'll cross them off the list!
GID00003671	So this is what the rest of the world looks like!
GID00003672	Everything looks bigger than I imagined!
GID00003673	Isn't this exciting? I know I'm excited!
GID00003674	I have a good feeling about this! It's going to be great!
GID00003675	I bet I'm going to like it in that mainframe!
GID00003676	For a while, you were the toast of the Ultra-Luxe, but you're simply not en vogue any longer. Your act has gotten stale.
GID00003677	You're still welcome to dine with us, of course. We've just had quite enough of paying you to play our games.
GID00003678	Sure. Pearl gave the green light. Take a look at the manifest.
GID00003679	Not without Pearl's permission, and she hasn't given permission.
GID00003680	Later.
GID00003681	My deepest apologies for the slightest inconvenience. You have my assurance that everything will be returned upon your departure.
GID00003682	But we simply can't have anyone waving their weapons around in the hotel. It's not the atmosphere we wish to cultivate.
GID00003683	Please, enjoy your stay.
GID00003684	My deepest apologies for the slightest inconvenience. You have my assurance that everything will be returned upon your departure.
GID00003685	But we simply can't have anyone waving their weapons around in the hotel. It's not the atmosphere we wish to cultivate.
GID00003686	Please, enjoy your stay.
GID00003687	I'm afraid those are the rules. If you don't like it you can take your business elsewhere.
GID00003688	How frightfully uncouth. I'm afraid I must insist you relinquish your weapons.
GID00003689	Well, I never.
GID00003690	They'll be handled with the utmost security in our bank.
GID00003691	Here is what we have available.
GID00003692	I bet you would, but Pearl didn't give me permission to sell to outsiders.
GID00003693	Bye.
GID00003694	Sometimes it makes grandma forget things she doesn't want to forget, pumpkin.
GID00003695	Are you sure, dearie? Taking my medicine all the time makes me feel woozy, but it does make it easier for me to ignore Leo.
GID00003696	That's sweet of you, dearie. I'll try to be better about controlling myself if I see you try to sneak away.
GID00003697	Oh my stars! Are you sure? If I don't take any medicine at all, Leo gets especially cranky. I can't stop him when he's like that.
GID00003698	Whenever you're ready, dear.
GID00003699	Well, all right, then, dearie. I suppose I'll have my holotapes to remind me of Becky and Jimmy....
GID00003700	Yes, dearie?
GID00003701	All right, pumpkin.
GID00003702	All right, dear. If you're really sure.
GID00003703	You think I'm handsome? Wow, I wonder if she does, too!
GID00003704	No. Those aren't for outsiders to use. Leave them alone.
GID00003705	Anything else you need? I've got work to do.
GID00003706	[SUCCEEDED] Well, if you genuinely care so much, they're flight simulators. If you don't know our history yet, you should see Pete and get the tour.
GID00003707	We dream to one day rule the skies.
GID00003708	[FAILED] Talk to Pete if you're so curious.
GID00003709	I just told you, the robots are going to handle it. They'll break the plane down into pieces and move it up from Callville Bay in one shot.
GID00003710	Hey, I better get rolling. Jack and I have a lot of work ahead of us!
GID00003711	[SUCCEEDED] Exactly. We'll be shelling an unoccupied location in Outer Vegas to get their attention elsewhere.
GID00003712	By the time they realize they aren't under attack, the plane and the bots will be long gone.
GID00003713	The kids wish we were shelling a real target, but Pearl thinks it wise to not start up a war just as the lady has risen.
GID00003714	[FAILED] We've got that covered. They won't be a problem.
GID00003715	Let's just say they'll be a little distracted for a while.
GID00003716	All right.
GID00003717	Well he might've been wearing a fancy outfit, but he wasn't any kind of a gentleman to me.
GID00003718	Had his nose stuck so high in the air, you couldn't see it above the clouds. City folk, they always think they deserve better than what they got.
GID00003719	Those hoodlums he was with seemed to know Manny for some reason. He's our daytime sniper, up in the dinosaur's mouth.
GID00003720	Can't say as I have, but we usually keep to ourselves down here. You might have more luck up by the motel.
GID00003721	Maybe ask Jeannie May. Nothing happens in this town that she don't know about. She'll be up in the lobby, most days.
GID00003722	Sure have. Camouflage, that coat was, trying to hide from extra terrestrials what can only see in black and white checkers.
GID00003723	But they're not fooled 'cause he forgot to put the checkers on his face. I told him so and he seemed to take it to heart.
GID00003724	They stayed here a night, and was up by the dinosaur talking to the sniper fella with the moustache a couple of times.
GID00003725	Sure, but he didn't buy any souvenirs, if that's what you're wondering. Sounded like he didn't have his money with him.
GID00003726	His friends seemed disappointed about it. Heck, I would be, too, if I found such a fine store and left my money elsewhere.
GID00003727	Manny might know more about them. Thought he might've been friends with one or two of 'em. He's up in the dino mouth during the day.
GID00003728	No, but I've been laid up for a while now. Haven't been able to keep an eye on things like usual.
GID00003729	It's a small town, though. I'm sure someone would've noticed somebody like that if they came this way.
GID00003730	Oh, that old thing? That's a holotape from the last time I visited my grandkids. Such sweet little children, you know. Little angels.
GID00003731	Sometimes it's hard to remember them, so I take that old tape out from time to time and listen.
GID00003732	It's my medicine, dearie. It keeps me calm, but it makes my memory go all fuzzy. That's why I only take my dosage every other time.
GID00003733	That way at least I remember their faces.
GID00003734	Ohh... that was a bad one, wasn't it, Leo?
GID00003735	Grandma's feeling calmer now, dearie.
GID00003736	Oh my stars, did I do all of this?
GID00003737	Gracious me, I lost control a bit there!
GID00003738	I would. I'm the senior-most paladin in the Chapter, and have more combat experience than any two others here put together.
GID00003739	I'd gladly support another candidate, but no one has the courage to step forward and make the attempt, so it falls to me.
GID00003740	I would put this chapter back on the right path, if I could just assume leadership.
GID00003741	That'll have to do. I'd recommend going to see Ramos first. As head of security, he's more familiar with our protocols than anyone else here.
GID00003742	You could also try to find something relevant in our datastore, though last I heard, Scribe Ibsen has having a bit of a problem accessing it.
GID00003743	And if McNamara should give you any tasks, I'd ask that you kept me abreast of them.
GID00003744	Report anything you find to me, and we'll move from there.
GID00003745	If I become Elder, the lockdown will be lifted, and we'll once again be able to send patrols out into the wastes. We'll become powerful again.
GID00003746	And when that happens, it will be good to have the Brotherhood as an ally. Good enough?
GID00003747	You speak truly, for it is unlikely that an outsider would know both the Elder's name and that passphrase.
GID00003748	Very well. I've been observing the penal facility there in the distance for some time now, after having followed some rather disturbing rumors.
GID00003749	The facility was run by the NCR for a time, but the prisoners overcame their guards and now use the prison as a base from which to conduct raids.
GID00003750	What puzzles me is why these men have been allowed to run wild for so long unchecked. Why has the NCR not retaken this place?
GID00003751	Give this to the Elder. My observations are all within. Perhaps he will have a better idea of what this situation portends.
GID00003752	The facility was run by the NCR for a time, but the prisoners overcame their guards and used the prison as a base from which to conduct raids.
GID00003753	Eventually, the NCR got around to putting the prisoners down, but not until they had wreaked havoc on nearby trade routes.
GID00003754	Give this to the Elder. My observations are all within. Perhaps he will have a better idea of what this situation portends.
GID00003755	The facility was run by the NCR for a time, but the prisoners overcame their guards and used the prison as a base from which to conduct raids.
GID00003756	Eventually, the NCR tried to put the prisoners down, but they were overwhelmed by them, and haven't sent troops to the area since.
GID00003757	Give this to the Elder. My observations are all within. Perhaps he will have a better idea of what this situation portends.
GID00003758	My purpose here is none of your concern. Now leave me be or I'll be forced to defend myself.
GID00003759	See that you do. I'd advise you to avoid the prison over there. It's overrun by barbarians and the whole place may become a battlefield at any time.
GID00003760	Strange that the Elder should send an outsider, but I suppose he has his reasons.
GID00003761	My observations have mostly focused on the small town to the south of here. It was cruelly attacked, its inhabitants slain nearly to the last.
GID00003762	That such an act could occur so far west is nearly unthinkable. The NCR has forces in all directions, and an outpost scant miles west from here.
GID00003763	That they have not responded to this violence shows either an unwillingness or inability to properly defend their borders, which is telling.
GID00003764	I've collected such musings in this report. Please take it to the Elder.
GID00003765	That's none of your business. I suggest you head back the way you came.
GID00003766	If so, you may wish to go around that town to the south. It's been taken by slavers, and they seem to be waiting for something, or someone.
GID00003767	Then I am sworn to report. I've been dividing my time between the camps to the north and south of here.
GID00003768	One belongs to the NCR, the other to a band of slavers known as Caesar's Legion. I was sure the NCR would quickly win, but that has not happened.
GID00003769	Instead, the two sides have reached a stalemate, and only occasionally send skirmishers against one another.
GID00003770	If I didn't know better, I'd say neither side is confident enough to push for a full victory. Which seems strange given the NCR's technological edge.
GID00003771	In any event, I've recorded my findings in this report. Please deliver it to the Elder. I am sure he will find the contents most interesting.
GID00003772	Instead, the two sides maintained a long stalemate, and only after an extended duration did the NCR finally destroy its opponent.
GID00003773	When they did, it appeared they did so with the help of fresh reinforcements. I do not believe they could have managed the feat without them.
GID00003774	That savages such as these could last so long against the NCR is troubling. Please, take my findings to the Elder. He'll know what to make of this.
GID00003775	Instead, the two sides maintained a long stalemate, and after an extended time the slavers rose up and slaughtered the NCR to the man.
GID00003776	That barbarians with such crude weapons could crush a foe that defeated us is food for much thought.
GID00003777	Here, take my report to the Elder. He must be made aware of what happened here.
GID00003778	Instead, the two sides maintained a long stalemate, and after some time fighting broke out and both sides were mysteriously wiped out.
GID00003779	Things were rather chaotic, so I wasn't able to see exactly what happened, or who did the deed, but seeing the NCR suffer such a loss was a shock.
GID00003780	The Elder must know of what happened here. Take this report to him. It contains my notes on these events. Maybe he'll make some sense of it all.
GID00003781	I've no reason to disclose the purpose of my actions to a stranger. Please leave.
GID00003782	Do that. And take care to avoid the valley to the east, if you know what's good for you.
GID00003783	The less who are aware of this situation, the better. My brothers and sisters were deeply traumatized by the losses we incurred several years ago.
GID00003784	It would be imprudent to worry them unduly without first discovering the facts of the situation.
GID00003785	I can spare a little time. What did you want to talk about?
GID00003786	Let's just say that people around here talk about you. They say things, not nice things. We only like to hear nice things, get it?
GID00003787	Yeah, that's right. Now, get the fuck out of our sight, before we change our minds.
GID00003788	Yeah, that's right. Now, get the fuck out of our sight, before we change our minds.
GID00003789	That's not going to cut it anymore. You've become a pain in the ass around here. Double that or we're going to box your ears.
GID00003790	That's not going to cut it anymore. You've become a pain in the ass around here. Double that or we're going to box your ears.
GID00003791	You cheap bastard, like all Mojave people. I'd beat you senseless right now, if we didn't have more important things to do.
GID00003792	But this is not over, get it? We'll see each other again, when you least expect it.
GID00003793	Think you can get away with this? Guys, time to rough this one up!
GID00003794	Yeah, that's right. Now, get the fuck out of our sight, before we change our minds.
GID00003795	This shit is not going to come off, I'm telling you.
GID00003796	I can deal with them dancing in the fountain, I can deal with them running a Brahmin down The Strip.
GID00003797	Hell, I can even deal with the puke in the latrines. But I can't stand the smell of turpentine, fuck that!
GID00003798	You know what? It's all yours, then. Fuck this shit! I'm done.
GID00003799	Shut up, and get to it. You rather be elsewhere? I can arrange a trip to the sewers - you'll love the smell.
GID00003800	Hey, talk to Pappas if you've got complaints. I'm just want to be done with this shit.
GID00003801	Hey... Hey! Where the hell are you going?Well, fuck you, then!
GID00003802	Don't rightly know - I just got the notion to make my way to New Vegas. Reckon I'll find out when I get there.
GID00003803	Likewise, friend - likewise. Is there anything old Vic can do you for?
GID00003804	No, don't believe I did, but you might ask around - the Novac folk usually see anyone traveling this way.
GID00003805	I'll let that slide seeing how you gotta mind full of vengeance for that no-good polecat and all.
GID00003806	Be seeing you.
GID00003807	Novac? Nice enough place I suppose... but between you and me - when I rolled into town my skin started to itch. Watch yourself.
GID00003808	Seeing how this is the only road around, I'd be a sight more surprised if we didn't run into each other from time to time.
GID00003809	Now don't go getting paranoid, pardner - that bullet to your brain-pan probably just bucked your Brahmin a little. We're all friends here.
GID00003810	Well, this ain't New Vegas, but I reckon you can find what you need here. Try the office out front.
GID00003811	That's a mighty fine offer, but I'm gonna need to conserve my strength if I'm to make it all the way to New Vegas.
GID00003812	I'm sure you'll do just fine without old Vic slowing you down.
GID00003813	Just rolling along on my spurs. Looks like I just might make it to New Vegas after all.
GID00003814	Yup, but this is getting a might embarrassing - people are going to start to talk. <laughs>
GID00003815	'Benny'? Fancy-pant's name is Benny? No, but I reckon that 'Bunny' hopped his way back to New Vegas.
GID00003816	Fancy-pants? No, I ain't seen hide-nor-hair of him since the tussle in Goodsprings. I'm sure he ran back to the soft-living of New Vegas, 'though.
GID00003817	Look me up when you get to New Vegas - I'll buy the first round.
GID00003818	Yup. Guess it's just down to you and fancy-pants. I wouldn't worry about him - he looked all hat and no cattle if you ask me.
GID00003819	Now-now, it ain't my fault that Dorothy and the Tin Man happened to be on the same yellow-striped road, is it?
GID00003820	Right here... where did you come from?
GID00003821	Tumble-whats?
GID00003822	Doggies!
GID00003823	There in the corral.
GID00003824	Crazy with low prices on Wind-Brahmin. You buy one.
GID00003825	Yes - the herd.
GID00003826	Good doing business - enjoy Wind-Brahmin.
GID00003827	You not buy?! Then you die!
GID00003828	All.
GID00003829	They are very good Wind-Brahmin - all caps.
GID00003830	Ha-ha! Stupid human!
GID00003831	Okay! You know where to go. See you soon!
GID00003832	Go all the way down to the Vault's main game room, take the hallway to your left and then the first room on the left-hand side. Enjoy your stay!
GID00003833	Uh... Hello? Hi. Are you there? Oh, right. You can't respond. Listen, I'm using your robot as a relay to get this message to you.
GID00003834	I've picked up some unusual chatter regarding your robot. It seems that it has some information that we could use. Oh wait, where are my manners?
GID00003835	This is Lorenzo, a Knight with the Brotherhood of Steel. We'd be very interested in examining your tech.
GID00003836	Could you bring your robot to one of our patrols so they can examine it? I'll have the robot mark the location on your map.
GID00003837	Hi there, my name is April Martimer. I monitored a communication earlier between you and someone with the Brotherhood of Steel.
GID00003838	I'm with the Followers of the Apocalypse. We are much more liberal about the sharing of technology than those Brotherhood... People.
GID00003839	Bring your robot to us, we'll see that whatever information it may have on it is used for the greater good.
GID00003840	Hi there, my name is April Martimer. I've heard through various channels that you have some... curious robot with you.
GID00003841	I'm with the Followers of the Apocalypse, we'd love to have the opportunity to examine the technology on that machine.
GID00003842	We'll make sure whatever information we find is used for the greater good - and who knows, I may be able to give it some kind of upgrade for you.
GID00003843	There's usually a bar in every stop along the road. Helps me sleep. Well, not really, but I tell myself that.
GID00003844	Sometimes I have to brew it myself if I'm too far from a bar. Not quality, but I'm for anything that takes the edge off the day.
GID00003845	Yeah, what else you going to do with an empty bottle? Wait for it to refill itself?
GID00003846	Get me some ingredients out of the Mojave, an empty bottle, a little time, and I'll keep us stocked.
GID00003847	Look, no guarantee on the quality, only the results. And don't drink too much of this stuff or you might go blind.
GID00003848	All right, I'll start brewing.
GID00003849	Here you go. Go easy on it until you train yourself to choke back the urge to gag. After a few bottles and the vomiting, it ain't so bad.
GID00003850	Don't have all the ingredients you need - come back when you have 'em, and I'd be happy to get something cooking.
GID00003851	As you may have already heard, this entire base is under a state of lockdown. No one goes out except small patrols at night.
GID00003852	Most of the chapter has been sealed in here for years, and those few who were outside when the lockdown was initiated are forbidden from returning.
GID00003853	Morale has plummeted as time has gone by, and many of our current paladins haven't even seen combat outside of training simulations.
GID00003854	And all because of the Elder's explicit order that no one be allowed in or out. The only way things will change is if a new Elder is installed.
GID00003855	If you change your mind, though, come find me, and we'll talk more.
GID00003856	Why should you trust the Elder? I'd recommend listening to both of us, and choosing whom to trust for yourself.
GID00003857	So are you willing to listen?
GID00003858	Veronica's a special case. She handles the procurement of supplies. If we didn't let her and those like her back in, we'd all starve.
GID00003859	If the Elder could manage it, he'd shut them out as well, and all in the name of security. Which is why we need to replace him.
GID00003860	Of course I have. Many times, in fact. The Elder has an open door policy, and will listen to advice on any subject, save this one.
GID00003861	He refuses to see that our isolation is slowly weakening us. Aside from being our duty, going out on missions is what kept us strong.
GID00003862	And because he fails to see that, he must be replaced.
GID00003863	You got yourself a bad reputation with us - that's what.
GID00003864	You've got three days to improve your reputation with the NCR or we come for you... without all of this pleasant conversation.
GID00003865	Have a nice day now, you hear?
GID00003866	You're asking for leniency from us? Are you crazy?! We show up when the talking's over, get it?
GID00003867	Crap, you don't even want to live a few more days? Go. Get laid one more time or something - we're walking away. Three days.
GID00003868	Three days.
GID00003869	Slavers, killers, and all other kinds of trouble. They dress up like Roman soldiers, so there's no mistaking it when you see them.
GID00003870	The rumor is that the Legion is far larger than the NCR lets on, and that it's been due to luck that the Legion hasn't overrun the territory.
GID00003871	I'm pretty sure the NCR wants to hold onto the Dam because it's one of the few places around that can make electricity.
GID00003872	The Legion are a bunch of savages, though. No idea why they'd want the Dam. Probably plan on destroying it or something.
GID00003873	I knew he was carrying the Platinum Chip! And I knew right where Benny should wait for him!
GID00003874	I knew she was carrying the Platinum Chip! And I knew right where Benny should wait for her!
GID00003875	That's why Benny put me here! To monitor Mr. House's data transmissions. They're all encrypted, of course - but I'm quite a decrypter!
GID00003876	Did you know that Mr. House spent 812,545 caps hiring salvage teams to find the Platinum Chip- just in the last year alone? Of course you didn't!
GID00003877	Or that there were seven couriers, but six of them were carrying junk? How about their exact routes, and the mercenary teams that screened them?
GID00003878	I knew all that. Pretty smart, huh?
GID00003879	Hahaha! I know that's not true, because you still have a head!
GID00003880	Hahaha! That's not funny, you getting shot in the head.
GID00003881	I really shouldn't have taken so much pride in how I set that up, huh? I feel really bad right now.
GID00003882	I feel really bad telling you this, but I kind of... can't die. I mean, go ahead and destroy this Securitron, get it out of your system!
GID00003883	The problem is that a distributed image of my neuro-computational matrix is backed-up to the network several times a day, or when I'm threatened!
GID00003884	I can't help it! There's a little bit of me in every Securitron out on the Strip, so if this instance gets destroyed, I just download to a new one.
GID00003885	If I could stop it from happening, I would! I mean, your vengeance is going to feel so incomplete!
GID00003886	Hahaha! I knew there was a positive in it somewhere!
GID00003887	Hi there! Come with me!
GID00003888	Just to the top of the ridge up here...
GID00003889	See that? Vegas, right? Same as always - but not tonight!
GID00003890	5... 4... 3... 2... 1!
GID00003891	Pretty nice, huh? But that's not all!
GID00003892	Now that the Lucky 38's reactor is fired up, Vegas doesn't need the dam to have power! Vegas is energy-independent! Whoo-hoo!
GID00003893	If we keep the dam running, we can sell all its electricity to the NCR for a nice profit. Vegas doesn't need it!
GID00003894	Hope to see you soon!
GID00003895	Nolan, we'll resume this discussion later. I can see you have company.
GID00003896	I don't know. I've gone through our records dozens of times looking for a precedent regarding the dismissal of an Elder and come up with nothing.
GID00003897	The people who are most likely to know how it could be done are also some of McNamara's strongest supporters, so they refuse to help me.
GID00003898	Which is why we're having this conversation. An outsider such as yourself would arouse less suspicion asking questions about such matters.
GID00003899	The fact that the Elder has some tasks for you means his faithful won't suspect you, and you have a line open to the man himself.
GID00003900	In short, you're in a perfect position to help me. Will you at least think about it?
GID00003901	I half expected you to say that. In which case, I'll continue to pursue the matter on my own.
GID00003902	Should you continue dealing with the Elder and find yourself beginning to see my point of view, I'll be around.
GID00003903	What were you doing looking at my terminal? No, never mind that. You can't tell anyone about what you found!
GID00003904	There'd be widespread panic. The Elder has the situation under control.
GID00003905	...Yes. When I first discovered how much the systems had deteriorated, I reported it to the Elder right away.
GID00003906	He told me he'd take action right away, and sent out several patrols to search for parts.
GID00003907	No! Please don't! Everyone would blame me! Look, I'll do whatever you want, just name it!
GID00003908	Thank you. There's no telling what would happen if everyone were to suddenly find out, but I trust it wouldn't be good.
GID00003909	Fine, but you're making a big mistake. Hardin isn't half the leader that McNamara is.
GID00003910	I don't have time to think about silly things like politics right now. My main concern right now is getting this blasted datastore up and running.
GID00003911	I can understand how the man might be frustrated by the current situation. He's a take-charge sort of fellow. Standing around's not his strong suit.
GID00003912	I myself often wish we could end this interminable stasis and begin moving forward again.
GID00003913	I suppose I could take a small break, but I can only spare a little time. Ask away.
GID00003914	Oh, all kinds of things! There was already information regarding the layout and systems of this bunker, but we've since added our own data as well.
GID00003915	Prior to the lockdown, we had extensively scouted the surrounding area, and compiled dossiers on nearby points of interest.
GID00003916	Yes, did you have an idea that might help us?
GID00003917	I do that all the time myself. One moment I'll think I've solved the conundrum, and the next I'm back to square one. Don't let it bother you.
GID00003918	Was there something else you wanted?
GID00003919	Our patrols are always bringing more stuff in. Take a look.
GID00003920	If you happen to find it, bring it here right away. I might be able to throw a few supplies your way if you do.
GID00003921	If you must know, my inventory check this week shows that our weapon count is one short. Somehow we're missing a laser pistol.
GID00003922	Hardin will have my head if I don't find that weapon soon. I can't delay my report to him any longer.
GID00003923	Yes, I handle all medical needs in the bunker. If you're ever wounded, I can treat you, for a fee.
GID00003924	Normally I'd just be the base's medical officer, but my other duties say otherwise.
GID00003925	We have equipment here to treat most physical injuries - lacerations, broken bones, that sort of thing. We also carry a full supply of antitoxins.
GID00003926	You may have noticed the Bark Scorpions up above. Though tiny, their venom packs quite a punch. Treating scorpion stings is my most common procedure.
GID00003927	I can also treat any form of radiation sickness you pick up out in the waste, no matter what stage, save the last.
GID00003928	I'm this bunker's Head Scribe in everything but name. I supervise the research teams. I collate the reports. I attend the meetings.
GID00003929	But for reasons beyond me, that buffoon Taggart still gets the title. And don't get me started on that little pet of his.
GID00003930	Everyone around here knows what's going on there but her.
GID00003931	If you wish.
GID00003932	Oh, I tried. The elder listened patiently to my carefully constructed argument regarding why that buffoon should lose his position.
GID00003933	Then he just as patiently explained to me that Taggart's work was vital to our cause, and that he wasn't to be trifled with "lesser matters."
GID00003934	But vital to our cause? Hardly.
GID00003935	She's cute, isn't she? Like a puppy, almost. Unfortunately, our Head Scribe's intentions toward her aren't quite so innocent.
GID00003936	I don't appreciate how much harder I have to work to cover for his tendency to focus on his personal projects.
GID00003937	I try not to think too much about his personal proclivities.
GID00003938	It's our virtual reality training hall. We don't really go out all that often anymore, so this is how we stay sharp.
GID00003939	Head Scribe Taggart quickly realized my extraordinary talent when I took the mandatory VR combat testing.
GID00003940	Soon after that, he requested that I get transferred to VR specialist training, serving as his assistant.
GID00003941	I miss hanging out with the other students all the time, but at least I get to skip all those boring lectures.
GID00003942	Yeah, a lot more. Back when we were at the HELIOS station. Er, crap.
GID00003943	I'm pretty sure I'm not supposed to talk about that, especially with outsiders, so forget you just heard that, okay?
GID00003944	Well, like just about everyone else here, I grew up in the Brotherhood. My father was a Scribe and my mother a Paladin.
GID00003945	They both died at HELIOS One. The others were always like a family to me before that, but afterward they became my family in truth.
GID00003946	I don't know, I'm a little like both of them I guess. If I had to choose, I really don't know which I'd pick.
GID00003947	That's a question I've been asked a lot lately, since it's something I have to decide for myself soon.
GID00003948	That was so much fun! The wind whipping through our hair, not knowing what was going to jump out at us at any moment.
GID00003949	And when those scorpions came out! It was just like the sims! All I had to do was line then up and squeeze the trigger.
GID00003950	I doubt I'll be able to get Stanton to go with me again, though. I thought he'd enjoy it as much as I did, but he was just scared the whole time.
GID00003951	Don't tell him I told you this, but when those scorpions surrounded us, I'd bet a week's rations he pissed himself!
GID00003952	I'm currently an Apprentice in the Brotherhood, and recently became eligible for Journeyman status.
GID00003953	But first, I have to decide which Order I want to join - the Knights or the Scribes.
GID00003954	Okay.
GID00003955	Knights are in charge of all of our equipment. Power armor, gatling lasers, you name it. All of it built and maintained by Knights.
GID00003956	Knights also get to go out on patrols, scouting assignments, and support the Paladins in offensive operations.
GID00003957	Being a Knight would mean getting to see more of the world, fight the Brotherhood's enemies, and possibly someday become a Paladin like my mother.
GID00003958	The Scribes are responsible for discovering how all the old tech we recover actually works and sometimes even work on inventing new things.
GID00003959	Without them, the Brotherhood could never fulfill its mission. Or at least, that's what my dad always used to say.
GID00003960	While that is disheartening news, there remains hope that the other two patrols may still be found alive.
GID00003961	T-That is unfortunate. As long as there is a chance to find the remaining patrol, however, I must still ask you to try.
GID00003962	I suppose I am not surprised. We have few friends in the world above, and many enemies.
GID00003963	Keep looking for them. The information they have is vital.
GID00003964	Then allow me to explain our situation. This bunker is currently locked down, allowing no entry or exit, with you being one of the few exceptions.
GID00003965	In exceptional cases, teams are sent out to investigate sites or retrieve materials deemed too important to ignore.
GID00003966	Three such teams have gone missing recently, and the news of their disappearance has not yet been widely spread to avoid undue concern.
GID00003967	In order to maintain the peace, and adhere to the strictures of the lockdown, I need to send someone else to discover what happened to them.
GID00003968	Then that is your choice. If you should change your mind, please return.
GID00003969	I'm sure someone's told you all this before. Several years back, we were running our chapter out the HELIOS One solar power station.
GID00003970	Our Elder at the time, Elijah, had some kind of obsession with the place. Which is the only reason we stayed as long as we did.
GID00003971	That place was hardly defensible, and we knew the NCR was moving in on us, but the Elder refused to budge, insisting that he just needed "more time".
GID00003972	We never found out what he needed the time for. Wave upon wave of NCR troopers hit us from all directions.
GID00003973	We held out for a time, but we were grossly outnumbered, and they had more men than we had ammo. Eventually our positions collapsed.
GID00003974	Elder Elijah was nowhere to be found, so McNamara took charge and led what remained of us on a counter-offensive west.
GID00003975	We lost a lot of men and women, but we broke through and made it here. Make no mistake, McNamara saved this chapter that day.
GID00003976	That's right. Nothing gets in or out of here without me knowing it.
GID00003977	Normally, that would have fallen under my jurisdiction, but the Elder thought it'd provide a good test for you, so I backed off.
GID00003978	Yeah, I knew about it. They're still young, and they weren't going to go very far.
GID00003979	I had them on my monitors the whole time. I almost headed out there when they got surrounded by those scorpions, but Watkins is a hell of a shot.
GID00003980	Under the lockdown, only essential personnel are permitted to enter or leave. That includes supply runners and high security patrols.
GID00003981	All other personnel are forbidden to leave, and any personnel that were out there when the lockdown was enacted are forbidden from returning.
GID00003982	Fine by me.
GID00003983	So you've been talking to Hardin, eh? He's been looking for a way to usurp McNamara ever since the lockdown started.
GID00003984	Don't get me wrong, he's a good man, but Elder McNamara's done all right by us. If it weren't for him, none of us would have survived at HELIOS.
GID00003985	I'll tell you what I told Hardin. There have only been a few cases of Elders being dismissed from their posts in the Brotherhood's history.
GID00003986	And those involved crimes that someone like Elder McNamara is just not capable of. You can look it up for yourself, if you want.
GID00003987	I'll grant you access to that portion of the history section of our datastore. See Senior Scribe Ibsen about accessing it.
GID00003988	Who was Elijah, more like. He was our Elder before McNamara. Bright guy, but just between you and me he was a little off.
GID00003989	Our mission is to recover and preserve the technology of the past, but Elijah wanted more. He sought ways to improve upon technology, make it better.
GID00003990	When we found HELIOS One, he was like a kid in a candy store. He kept talking about the potential, and a "grand design, never realized."
GID00003991	He even insisted we set up our base there, against the objection of nearly every paladin. What followed is a whole other story.
GID00003992	Yeah, got this look when he saw you next down on the Courier list. His expression turned right around, asked me if your name was for real.
GID00003993	I said, sure as lack of rain, you were still kicking. Then he turned down the job, just like that. I asked if he was sure, it was good money.
GID00003994	No, let "Courier Six" carry the package, that's what he said - like the Mojave'd sort you out or something. Then he just up and walked out.
GID00003995	No idea. Sounds like you two had a history for him to act like that. And turn down the money, too.
GID00003996	Hope he didn't see any trouble in that package of yours. Maybe he thought your name was bad luck. Not for me to say.
GID00003997	Uh... Hello? Hi. Are you there? Oh, right. You can't respond. Listen, I'm using your robot as a relay to get this message to you.
GID00003998	I've picked up some unusual chatter regarding your robot. It seems that it has some information that we could use. Oh wait, where are my manners?
GID00003999	This is Lorenzo, a Knight with the Brotherhood of Steel. We'd be very interested in examining your tech.
GID00004000	Whenever you get a chance, can you bring your robot back to Hidden Valley so I can take a look at it?
GID00004001	Hi, sorry to break in, he sounded truly riveting. I don't want to keep you much longer, but I'd like to make a counter suggestion.
GID00004002	I'm with the Followers of the Apocalypse. We are much more liberal about the sharing of technology than those Brotherhood... People.
GID00004003	Bring your robot to us, we'll see that whatever information it may have on it is used for the greater good.
GID00004004	<Static>
GID00004005	Doesn't surprise me. Guy seemed like he'd do whatever it takes to get what he wants. Probably makes a lot of enemies.
GID00004006	Well listen, I can definitely help you find him, but I've got problems of my own.
GID00004007	Maybe we can do a trade. You need my help. There's something I need, too.
GID00004008	You talking about that chip? Man, I don't think he's giving it up.
GID00004009	Must be something pretty important to be chasing a guy like that.
GID00004010	Hey, doesn't matter to me. I was just curious.
GID00004011	A piece of the action, huh? I don't think he's the sharing type, but okay.
GID00004012	Oh yeah? A good friend? If you say so, man.
GID00004013	Hey, do what you want. I'm just trying to make it easier on you.
GID00004014	Novac, it's home for me now. I want that to be for good. I like it here, and I've left too many homes behind.
GID00004015	But the only resource we got here is junk. Without that, people wouldn't have anything to trade. They'd all have to leave.
GID00004016	We get most of it up the road from the old rocket test site. But a bunch of ghouls showed up one day and took it over. We can't get in there now.
GID00004017	Yeah, I... everybody depends on you, you know? But they don't ask you about how you feel. What you worry about.
GID00004018	There's something I like about you. You just seem really understanding. I was gonna ask you for a favor, but I'll just tell you what you wanna know.
GID00004019	No clue. I know Benny hadn't paid up yet. Maybe that was where they were supposed to get square.
GID00004020	It's straight up Route 93 from here. Just keep following the road north.
GID00004021	Glad I could help.
GID00004022	Hey, I know you got no reason to help me now, but you seem really nice. Could I at least tell you about the problem we've got here?
GID00004023	Hope that helps. I owed you.
GID00004024	See? I was right about you.
GID00004025	Say no more. I hope things work out for you.
GID00004026	I would. But I've gotta watch the road. Caesar's Legion has been taking territory just east of here. They took Nelson.
GID00004027	If we let our guard down, they might attack. All it takes for the Legion is for them to sense weakness.
GID00004028	Well they gotta go, or this'll be a ghost town before long.
GID00004029	Doesn't matter to me what you do. As long as the ghouls are out of there, that's good enough for me.
GID00004030	It'd mean a lot to me.
GID00004031	The guy you're looking for, Benny, he was traveling with some members from my old gang. They were going to Boulder City.
GID00004032	Sure could use a drink.
GID00004033	All this traveling's making me thirsty.
GID00004034	Careful if we go off the road.
GID00004035	Don't mind trailblazing as long as we got the ammo. And whiskey.
GID00004036	Feels good not to have to drag a Brahmin train across the Mojave.
GID00004037	Glad I left the Outpost behind.
GID00004038	Caravan of two now.
GID00004039	Leo is a very bad man, pumpkin! Yes you are, Leo, don't try to deny it!
GID00004040	He tells me to do things, terrible things, and sometimes the medicine isn't enough to keep him quiet!
GID00004041	Doctor Henry calls them "anti-psychotics." I don't know what they're supposed to do, they just make my memory fuzzy.
GID00004042	This old thing? Oh, I scavenged it off a wreck in Klamath. Leo showed me how to make it all ready for chopping, didn't you, Leo?
GID00004043	Well of course there is, dearie. How else could I hear him tell me who to chop?
GID00004044	You shouldn't say things like that where Leo can hear you, dearie. He doesn't like it.
GID00004045	Okay, I'll tell you everything I know, like I promised.
GID00004046	Just head over to the REPCONN test site west of here. See if you can get the ghouls out of there.
GID00004047	If we need something obliterated, Raquel and the howitzer crews are more than qualified.
GID00004048	No, we have more specialized issues we need help with right now.
GID00004049	All right. What's on your mind?
GID00004050	Be sure to stop on back and let me know when the arrays are fixed.
GID00004051	Oh, pumpkin, grandma's sorry about that. Sometimes she gets mad and listens to Leo when she really shouldn't.
GID00004052	The medicine is supposed to help with that, but sometimes grandma doesn't take it.
GID00004053	Okay. Well... good luck to you. I'm heading back to the Prospector. I could use a drink about now.
GID00004054	Hey, do me a favor. Trudy - she's the bartender up at the Prospector, kind of the town mom - she likes to meet newcomers.
GID00004055	She'd be cross with me if I didn't ask you to poke your head in and say hi.
GID00004056	Just keep an eye out for them while you travel. I've found cards in old boxes or forgotten on shelves. Can find some for sale, too.
GID00004057	Yeah.
GID00004058	Yeah.
GID00004059	You've done right by us, so I suppose I could spare some supplies.
GID00004060	We've recently started making our own stimpaks, but we just don't have the materials to make other meds. Sorry about the lack of selection.
GID00004061	Just let me know what you need.
GID00004062	Sorry friend, we really don't have a need for wasteland currency around here. We produce most of what we need.
GID00004063	Sure, I know him. What do you want with him?
GID00004064	This again? You gonna help me out with what I need, or not?
GID00004065	Heard NCR recon fucked up here once, with the Khans.
GID00004066	Heard NCR drove the Khans out of here, to Red Rock.
GID00004067	Place stinks of sand, piss, and vomit.
GID00004068	Refugees.
GID00004069	Watch out - easy to get sick around here.
GID00004070	Crazy ass radio signals around here, couldn't make sense of them.
GID00004071	Place sets geiger counters ticking.
GID00004072	No idea why the highest point in the Mojave is so rad-lit.
GID00004073	Just goes to show you, no matter where you go, there's NCR trying to hold onto every corner of the world.
GID00004074	Guess they chose this spot to spy on Caesar.
GID00004075	Poor bastards.
GID00004076	Guess NCR's fish food.
GID00004077	Nice sign.
GID00004078	Should kill all these slavers.
GID00004079	Damn slavers.
GID00004080	Those dogs look like they could savage a Securitron.
GID00004081	We go across that launch, we may not come back.
GID00004082	This is the only place to cross the Colorado safely.
GID00004083	I hope we're not planning to cross the river.
GID00004084	Only merchants, slaves and Legion come here.
GID00004085	Another proud NCR camp.
GID00004086	Probably chose this place because of the water supply.
GID00004087	Morale looks low.
GID00004088	I smell Hydra in the air, just a whiff.
GID00004089	Be damn careful here.
GID00004090	Don't like the way the men are looking at me.
GID00004091	Keep your eyes to yourself, Legion asshole.
GID00004092	Can't believe you want to talk to this guy.
GID00004093	Love how he's decorated the place.
GID00004094	Women might as well be dirt... not anxious to join them.
GID00004095	Wish these women would take knives to Caesar's troops in their beds.
GID00004096	Can't belive we're fucking back here.
GID00004097	Testing our luck coming back here.
GID00004098	You sure you know what you're doing?
GID00004099	They try and put one of those Brahmin packs on me, they're asking for a gelding. Going to get gelded.
GID00004100	Can't say I've seen a smile on anyone's face since we arrived.
GID00004101	Hope NCR wipes Caesar off the map.
GID00004102	Guess the tent belongs to the big man.
GID00004103	Not much future in the Legion if you don't have a dick.
GID00004104	I'm heading back West if Caesar moves on the Dam.
GID00004105	Not looking forward to being a Legion wife.
GID00004106	What's that hum?
GID00004107	Watch for scorpions.
GID00004108	Doesn't fell like the rest of the Mojave here.
GID00004109	Storms pick up quick around here.
GID00004110	Check out those guns - rumor had it they used to shoot planes down before the war.
GID00004111	Place looks like how my bladder feels.
GID00004112	Place always wants me to take a piss.
GID00004113	Ever look down the Dam? Sends your head spinning.
GID00004114	Place is fucking cold.
GID00004115	Pine trees?
GID00004116	Can't believe we're in a refuge for crazy super mutants.
GID00004117	Wish I'd packed a jacket.
GID00004118	Only seen snow, not walked through it. Crazy - frozen water? Should package this shit.
GID00004119	Heard they could make "ice" in the Old World and carry it around.
GID00004120	Dad used to say that in the Old World, people would put boards on their feet and soar down the mountains.
GID00004121	Back here again?
GID00004122	What, didn't see enough of the sites here the first time?
GID00004123	Once here, most just stall out, can't go deeper into territory.
GID00004124	Fucking monument.
GID00004125	From here, it's Nipton to the east or Primm to the north.
GID00004126	And here's the slice of the world where NCR's hands start slipping.
GID00004127	Guess the miners got fucked.
GID00004128	Where's the mine from here?
GID00004129	If this place got hit, Novac's next.
GID00004130	I think I'm going to be sick.
GID00004131	Nipton wasn't the best towns, but...
GID00004132	Mayor Steyn got what was coming to him, looks like.
GID00004133	Mayor here used to shelter gangers, hear tell. Guess it didn't save him.
GID00004134	Should we cut the people down...
GID00004135	Who the hell was that?
GID00004136	I... hope they don't hit the Mojave Outpost.
GID00004137	Smells like deathclaw.
GID00004138	Looks like this place got wrecked.
GID00004139	Looks like this place go mined - in the wrong ways.
GID00004140	These boys and girls can really down the bottles.
GID00004141	Whiskey and liquor don't last long around here, by the sight of it.
GID00004142	Wonder if any of these folks would be up for shots of courage - and a wager.
GID00004143	Be *really* careful what you say here.
GID00004144	Should have heard stories of the Khans years ago - they were one tough bunch, now...
GID00004145	Khans lost their strength after Bitter Springs, came here to lick their wounds.
GID00004146	Let's not split up here, all right?
GID00004147	Don't take any chems here - hell knows what they're laced with.
GID00004148	Won't trade with Khans - they've poisoned most of the villages west of Vegas with chems.
GID00004149	Fiends would suffer withdrawal and die without the Khans.
GID00004150	Place would be beautiful... without the chem addicts and dealers.
GID00004151	|Annihilation| Guess someone had to put them down.
GID00004152	Have a Vegas-style boxing ring in the center there.
GID00004153	Really wish we could go to some civilized places.
GID00004154	Even the flies here are chemed.
GID00004155	God, you can smell the Brahmin shit from the jet all over this place.
GID00004156	"The Street" - Vegas Boulevard.
GID00004157	Fancy town... let's hit some bars.
GID00004158	Don't draw any guns and start shooting here - I heard the robots settle that trouble quick.
GID00004159	3 casinos here - Ultra-Luxe, Gomorrah, and the Tops. and, the Lucky 38.
GID00004160	Heard Crocker's running the Embassy - guy's funny, and not in a hee-haw way. More like a see-saw with his politics.
GID00004161	Captain Pappas keeps the law here. Watch out for her, she's no Crocker.
GID00004162	All right, then.
GID00004163	Goddamn Legion.
GID00004164	Oh, Jimmy, don't you go being silly now! Come over here and give your grandma some sugar!
GID00004165	I... Oh, of course I have, dearie. How silly of me. I didn't take my medicine yet today. How can I help you?
GID00004166	Of course, Jimmy.
GID00004167	Time for medicine!
GID00004168	Grandma has to take her pills now, dearie!
GID00004169	Medicine time!
GID00004170	There's my alarm - time to take my pills.
GID00004171	Hush, Leo, it's medicine time now!
GID00004172	Such a curious little munchkin, aren't you? What do you want to know?
GID00004173	Oh, don't you worry your silly little head about that, pumpkin. Grandma knows what she's doing.
GID00004174	Aww, someone wants to hear grandma's stories! What would you like to hear, pumpkin?
GID00004175	Isn't that sweet of you to fret about me? Such a good boy. I can always help you stay hidden from the bad people so you won't get in trouble.
GID00004176	I don't mind fighting - especially to protect you, dearie - but I don't like guns. Give me a good chopper, and Leo and I will go right to work!
GID00004177	Isn't that sweet of you to fret about me? Such a good girl. I can always help you stay hidden from the bad people so you won't get in trouble.
GID00004178	I don't mind fighting - especially to protect you, dearie - but I don't like guns. Give me a good chopper, and Leo and I will go right to work!
GID00004179	What do you need, sugar?
GID00004180	I grew up in Vault 17. I never even saw the sun until I was 75 years old - that was when Super mutants raided the Vault and carried a lot of us off.
GID00004181	Yes, Leo, I'm getting to that part! They made me one of them, and they put me to work in an army that was going to conquer California.
GID00004182	A spy. Sometimes an assassin. I killed a lot of folks for the Master. Yes, Leo, you helped, too.
GID00004183	Oh, he was a nasty man, dearie. You don't want to know about him. He was the one who made that Super mutant army I told you about.
GID00004184	That wicked old Master got what was coming to him, that's what! After his cathedral blew up, I decided it was high time to go home.
GID00004185	I'd really like my beret back, please.
GID00004186	Easy, boy.
GID00004187	Shh...
GID00004188	You think that did it? Maybe we should test the rangefinder outside.
GID00004189	Uh... yeah. I guess it works.
GID00004190	Yeah, I guess me and the guys could push this place over pretty easily.
GID00004191	First things first, though. You go settle things with Ringo and put a bullet between his eyes while I round up my crew and let them in on the plan.
GID00004192	Well for that your best bet is going to be talking to Deputy Beagle.
GID00004193	Since they came to town he was keeping a good bit of notes on them, and he was slinking around Bison Steve when your pretty-boy friend came through.
GID00004194	He may have heard where they were going.
GID00004195	Deputy Beagle would have been your best bet, before he met that tragic end.
GID00004196	Since they came to town he was keeping a good bit of notes on them, and he was slinking around Bison Steve when your pretty-boy friend came through.
GID00004197	Maybe you can track down whatever notes he was keeping and find some thing to help you there.
GID00004198	Nope. Different fella. Bigger. Had himself a face on a screen, and he talked more like you or me.
GID00004199	Nope. Different fella. Bigger. Had himself a face on a screen, and he talked more like you or me.
GID00004200	I'm sure it was very inspiring.
GID00004201	I go to grab him out of there and I notice he's holding something in his hand. Something metal.
GID00004202	He shuts himself back inside the closet and that's when I see the grenade he's left by my feet.
GID00004203	They do it a lot, the Legion. Using kids. They know we'll hesitate.
GID00004204	Anyway, that was the first time. Second time I fell down those stairs in front of the motel. Just in case I got to thinking I'd put it all behind me.
GID00004205	In Ranger school, they teach you how to spot a liar. I don't know why you're lying, but have it your way. We'll protect this town or die trying.
GID00004206	Well, thanks for telling me. I know that knowledge didn't come without risk.
GID00004207	Here. Take this, courtesy of the Ranger veterans fund.
GID00004208	Tell you what. I'll pay you for what you did, but I'll do you one better, too.
GID00004209	There's a move we have in the Rangers for knocking an opponent off his feet. Saved my butt a bunch of times, maybe it will for you too.
GID00004210	Let me show you how it's done.
GID00004211	They're the NCR's finest. A one-man platoon, each of 'em.
GID00004212	You got a job where even thinking about it would scare a man senseless, that's when you bring in the Rangers.
GID00004213	And if you see a squad of the veterans - guys who earned their black armor... well... you won't find a more beautiful sight.
GID00004214	[FAILED] Are you kidding me? I can't ship these things fast enough. People love them!
GID00004215	What the hell is this shit?
GID00004216	What the hell was that all about?
GID00004217	Should hit the Big Horn saloon here.
GID00004218	Heard there's still mines in the city - and maybe drunk NCR soldiers spoiling for a fight.
GID00004219	Rubble city, more like it.
GID00004220	There's a bar in the intact section, careful if you go wandering around the ruined section.
GID00004221	Not much reason to ship water here, but liquor... hard to meet demand.
GID00004222	If NCR didn't grate me so, I'd come here for water resupply.
GID00004223	Used to ship a lot of liquor here, soldiers here have too much free time.
GID00004224	If there's a reason to attack NCR, Camp Golf's a reason.
GID00004225	Watch out for the Misfits here - 9th Platoon, word of their fuck-ups is legendary.
GID00004226	Golf was a president, I think. Maybe for NCR.
GID00004227	Heard this used to be a mine field from some of the troopers here.
GID00004228	Each spot for a land mine is numbered, hear tell.
GID00004229	If you're looking for NCR's spine, ain't going to find it here.
GID00004230	Well, Hanlon sure let this place go to shit.
GID00004231	Lot of sites to this guy Golf all over the West.
GID00004232	Shit. Fiends.
GID00004233	Smells like Fiends.
GID00004234	Can smell the chem labs and Jet from here.
GID00004235	Make sure you have a backup weapon, Fiends don't go down easy.
GID00004236	Watch for dogs.
GID00004237	Heard tell there was a Vault somewhere around here.
GID00004238	Hometown of the Van Graffs, don't care for this place too much.
GID00004239	We shouldn't be in here.
GID00004240	Water's scarce, but between things like this and Lake Mead, ain't too bad in the West as in other places.
GID00004241	Watch out for the Kings, they're unpredictable.
GID00004242	Kings dress like strutting girls, all fancy like.
GID00004243	Once had a King following me like I was following you - had to chase him off with a shotgun finally.
GID00004244	Kings told me I couldn't deal water here, fuckers. They like having mono. As in monopoly.
GID00004245	Ralph might be able to forge a pass into the Strip for you, you need one.
GID00004246	Looking for weapons, check out Mick and Ralphs... Mick's probably a sight better than Ralph, always trying to talk me out of my pants.
GID00004247	Kings are led by the King. Has some kind of robot dog. Guess it hunts robot rats.
GID00004248	Kings hold control over the water pump 'round here.
GID00004249	Looks like prisoners are in charge now.
GID00004250	No guards in the towers, not a good sign.
GID00004251	Guess NCR fucked this place, too.
GID00004252	Folks here have access to Lake Mead, fresh drinking water.
GID00004253	Careful, Boomer territory. They ain't hostile, but they're a bit trigger happy.
GID00004254	Boomers are a might twitchy.
GID00004255	Folks here aren't friendly to anyone.
GID00004256	Don't be shooting wild in here - might set something off.
GID00004257	First time I seen a fence made out of artillery.
GID00004258	Some of these weapons look like they came from Hawthorne Army Depot, place has a lot of history.
GID00004259	Can hear the screaming of rockets and explosions in this place at night.
GID00004260	Got nests for planes here.
GID00004261	An assault on this place would be suicide.
GID00004262	This place reminds me the Old World had too much time on its hands.
GID00004263	Named this place after the hotel.
GID00004264	NoVac's the hotel, not the lizard.
GID00004265	Smells like junk.
GID00004266	Can see Dinky for miles, good landmark.
GID00004267	First saw this place, thought the giant gecko was real.
GID00004268	Read a book that giant lizards walked the earth like this one - might be a gecko this size.
GID00004269	Said there's a courier office here?
GID00004270	Sign of the buffalo.
GID00004271	Ah, Bison Steve, you old shithole.
GID00004272	Those post office boxes in these old towns still work.
GID00004273	Good contact, Nash, used to be here. Had a son that went West.
GID00004274	Old World had cars that ran on roads like these above the ground, 'cept they didn't go anywhere.
GID00004275	The sheriff here ain't worth a damn.
GID00004276	Crazy ass shit.
GID00004277	Rest stop.
GID00004278	NCR's friendly, might be able to resupply.
GID00004279	A little safe ground.
GID00004280	NCR flag - not safe, close to it, though.
GID00004281	Chairmen, Omertas... a whole bunch of families rule Vegas, don't step out a line as long as money's to be made.
GID00004282	Welcome to sin. Watch where you step.
GID00004283	Watch for NCR vomit.
GID00004284	Hope you're not here to chase your losses.
GID00004285	Now to find a bar.
GID00004286	Don't understand how the missiles could have missed a target like this.
GID00004287	Beats Freeside.
GID00004288	Can't believe we got in here.
GID00004289	Dad used to say this place was what Reno tried to be. Fucking Reno.
GID00004290	Place feels like the Sorcerer of Oz sometimes.
GID00004291	Heard stories about the Lucky 38, how nobody's ever gone inside - 'cept you, that is.
GID00004292	That hit the spot.
GID00004293	All right, now for some ass-kicking.
GID00004294	Pass the bottle.
GID00004295	Now all I need is some shame to wash it down with.
GID00004296	Bottoms up.
GID00004297	Oh, now, there goes the pain.
GID00004298	"Jean-Baptiste?" Sounds like someone got knocked out of the good book so hard his name broke.
GID00004299	Either that or it's Canadarian or some such shit. So who is this... "Baptiste" and what does he want?
GID00004300	Not much, and I haven't had occasion to look for anything more than that.
GID00004301	I've heard what most people know... he's said to run New Vegas, he runs the robots, but... well, no one's really seen him.
GID00004302	Well, except you, that is.
GID00004303	Of course, no one really will now that he's dead. Good thing, too, no idea what that contraption was on his pecker.
GID00004304	So if he wants to see you... well, that's a rare thing I wouldn't turn down. I'd ask him some hard questions if I were you.
GID00004305	The only Van Graffs I know are the ones out West - well, except for Gloria Van Graff, and I don't know her all that well, nor do I want to.
GID00004306	Don't have any objections speaking with him, though if he's with the Van Graffs, he should know I'm not looking to buy weapons.
GID00004307	Don't matter much how we settle this, as long as it gets settled.
GID00004308	No... still eating at me, though. Wouldn't mind taking another look. Something's off.
GID00004309	I think we should explore the next one, see what's up. Got my curiosity riled.
GID00004310	Nothing yet, but... something's there. Just got to look around and find it.
GID00004311	Not sure yet, something's definitely wrong. They were massacred, we should look around, find out why.
GID00004312	I'm already shadowing you, aren't I? Lead on, I'll follow.
GID00004313	Ask me to come with you, I'll think about it on the way.
GID00004314	Not leaving here until my caravan papers clear, or my title goes away.
GID00004315	If you were looking for someone to caravan with, I'd try the Crimson Caravan up north. They pretty much run the roads now.
GID00004316	Don't know, not sure where to head to next.
GID00004317	Well, they unloaded what they had left on the Dino Bite as a tax write-off. But that was before my time.
GID00004318	Plenty of demand for them, seeing as they're one-of-a-kind collectors items. But I might still have some in back.
GID00004319	That's a great idea.
GID00004320	We've accomplished a great deal, you and I. One last task, and our work is complete. I'll see you in the control room.
GID00004321	Then handle them with dispatch. The Legion's assault is imminent.
GID00004322	Oh god. He... I guess he was lost a long time ago. Even at the end...
GID00004323	Still... thanks for bringing word. At least, now I know.
GID00004324	Hmm. Unlikely. He was a little too focused on gears and diodes... tech was the cure-all.
GID00004325	Would you mind if I looked at the message?
GID00004326	Would you mind if I listened to the message?
GID00004327	Would you mind if I looked at the message you found?
GID00004328	Would you mind if I listened to the message you found?
GID00004329	Fine. I guess it doesn't matter anyway, keep it. I won't ask again.
GID00004330	What was on it? What did he say?
GID00004331	Yeah. Yeah. Thought as much. He'd been fading away for a long time.
GID00004332	You did? Where? Oh my God, I mean... I thought... I don't even know what I thought might have happened to him.
GID00004333	But... you don't have a "this is good news" expression on your face.
GID00004334	...it doesn't matter. He died when we all retreated to Hidden Valley. I didn't expect to see him again, no one did.
GID00004335	You killed him? But...
GID00004336	Did he say anything when you met him? Anything...anything at all?
GID00004337	Where did you get this?
GID00004338	Guess I was right about the bad news, huh? Same look Elder McNamara always gave me when I was up for promotion.
GID00004339	All right, I'll listen to it.
GID00004340	All right, I'll watch it.
GID00004341	That was... that was hard to watch.
GID00004342	The parts I understood? Didn't matter. Past all the garbage, all it amounted to was goodbye.
GID00004343	Sorry... feel a little out of it. Head's spinning a bit...
GID00004344	Oh. Oh!
GID00004345	I think he left me a gift. Maybe I can use it better than he did.
GID00004346	Trapped him? Where?
GID00004347	And I don't like saying this, but the Mojave's safer with him... there.
GID00004348	You? Did you re-direct the power stream back to our section?
GID00004349	We thought nobody would ever manage to get past the radiation, and the ghouls!
GID00004350	We owe you our freedom, outlander. Please, if there's anything we can do for you...
GID00004351	Yes, I believe that, outlander. We owe you our freedom.
GID00004352	Kindly! The leaders of this fine community have accepted us among them. They give us food and protection from the outside.
GID00004353	Some people here seem extremely unhappy. They keep talking about getting "shafted," "swindled," and "fucked."
GID00004354	Apparently somebody did them ill, all the way inside the surface-city with lights - the Strip, and Freeside, they call it.
GID00004355	We're lucky to be here, alive and well. The land's a mystery to us, but we'll find our place in it.
GID00004356	Until soon, I hope, outlander.
GID00004357	It fills me with hope to see that people from the surface world are kind, and brave. Again, thank you.
GID00004358	Of course, please, take this! We carried as much useful technology as we could, before our journey into the surface world.
GID00004359	Are you sure? What kind of injuries are we talking about?
GID00004360	Has this person's condition worsened? What are the symptoms?
GID00004361	Must not be that serious, then.
GID00004362	[SUCCEEDED] All right, that does sound bad. Here, take these - it should be enough. Good luck!
GID00004363	[FAILED] That does sound messy, but not too bad. I can't spare supplies for cuts and bruises.
GID00004364	[SUCCEEDED] All right, all right. I've got some extra leather armor and spare ammo for you. Don't hurt anybody if you don't have to, all right?
GID00004365	[FAILED] "Maybe" doesn't do much to convince me. No, just leave me out of this, all right?
GID00004366	[SUCCEEDED] All right! I can give you some of my extra leather armor and spare ammo. Just don't hurt anybody if you don't have to, all right?
GID00004367	[FAILED] Look, just leave me out of this, all right?
GID00004368	Yeah, quit it with the crazy talk.
GID00004369	Shit, yeah. Mayor Cobb - I like the sound of that. Running my own town will give me more pull with the guys at the prison, too.
GID00004370	First things first, though. You go settle things with Ringo and put a bullet between his eyes while I round up my crew and let them in on the plan.
GID00004371	Having all the food we want ain't a bad idea, actually. Getting sick of eating prison rations.
GID00004372	First things first, though. You go settle things with Ringo and put a bullet between his eyes while I round up my crew and let them in on the plan.
GID00004373	Make up your damn mind.
GID00004374	No shit? I guess the next thing we need to do is hang out and wait for the rest of my gang to show up so we can talk about the plan.
GID00004375	Did you want something else?
GID00004376	Sorry about the gun. You just caught me off guard, that's all.
GID00004377	We got off to a bad start. What say we start over with a friendly game of Caravan? You know how to play?
GID00004378	Well, the wildlife for one thing. Rowdy locals for another.
GID00004379	They're protecting their own. Just happens to help us.
GID00004380	They've been holding off this other group from the East, too.
GID00004381	Got a funny name. Call themselves Caesar's Legion. Never seen 'em in these parts, so I couldn't tell you much.
GID00004382	I hear rumors, that's about it. Supposedly they keep slaves and they got some real nasty ways of killing folks.
GID00004383	But maybe that's just something folks in the NCR cooked up to make themselves seem more useful here. Less uninvited.
GID00004384	Ha! If we had spare parts, do you think I'd be asking you to fix the damn things? That's rich.
GID00004385	No, we ran out of spares a while back, and Jack and I have been doing our best to patch the arrays up as best we can. Sadly, we're at our wit's end.
GID00004386	There have to be spare parts somewhere around the wasteland, but I just don't know where to direct you. You may have noticed we don't get out much.
GID00004387	Hey, that's great! You shouldn't have much trouble getting those fixed up, then. Just stop back when you're done.
GID00004388	Are you talking about that damn bright light we've seen blast off to the south occasionally? I was wondering what the hell that was.
GID00004389	If they've got the parts, bring them on back. We need to get the array back up and charging.
GID00004390	As long as you don't become an outright enemy of the Legion, payment will continue.
GID00004391	Stay an ally of the Legion and we will share our loot with you. If you start working against us - or become an enemy - our deal ends.
GID00004392	I think there's trouble in Nipton - no traffic from there on the roads, and while I can explain that away, the smoke from the town I can't.
GID00004393	I'm sure it's been hit - what I need to know is if they survived it. Might be Powder Gangers with all that smoke in the air.
GID00004394	If there's anybody left, they'd be in the Nipton Town Hall. Go there, check it out, let me know what you find.
GID00004395	The pay? The pay is a good goddamn thanks from the heart of the Republic!
GID00004396	Just shitting you with the NCR line, done wonders for morale around here. President Kimball keeps saying getting shot at is its own damn reward.
GID00004397	Do this job for me, though, I'll do what I can. People know I hate most everyone, so if I put in a word for you... that's gold.
GID00004398	Mind yourself on the plank going down.
GID00004399	Not much to tell, one of the worst posts in the NCR if you're looking to be anything more than a babysitter.
GID00004400	Full up here, but just enough so we can't send out patrols. Got to maintain a "standing force," Jackson's orders... NCR's orders.
GID00004401	Can't spare men for patrols or escorts, so caravans are backing up here like a Brahmin with a bottle in its ass. Typical NCR bullshit.
GID00004402	Hnh. Maybe Jackson got some additional soldiers after all. Didn't take you for a trooper at first, you seem a little... livelier than most.
GID00004403	All right, if you're here to assist, good, that's what I want to hear.
GID00004404	All right. Look at you, all fired up and ready to go. Wish the others around here had that kind of attitude.
GID00004405	Listen - I don't want you getting killed for this, so if you head there and run into trouble, I'm asking for eyes and ears, not your life. All right?
GID00004406	Legion this far West? You're fucking kidding me.
GID00004407	That's not outside the border, they're moving in - and fast. Nipton wasn't the most friendly town, but...
GID00004408	All right - thanks for checking on that, wish it set my mind at ease, now I'm more on edge than ever.
GID00004409	Got my post. Don't think I wouldn't go, too - if trouble's hit Nipton, town's got enough camping spots to rack up some easy kills.
GID00004410	Not about to have Jackson bust my ass again, though, even if I came back with Caesar's head - rather be sitting here than in a cell.
GID00004411	Kimball's Kimball, not sure which end is his ass or his head. Caravan families are causing trouble, Big Circle getting tense - the usual.
GID00004412	Look, you want gossip, go to the bar downstairs and listen to a whole lot of nothing. Me, I got to keep watch, then fill out the daily log.
GID00004413	Had to try. Smoke trail's getting thicker by the hour - wish Jackson could spare some men.
GID00004414	Better than nothing. But close to it.
GID00004415	Well, if you didn't see anyone, they might be gone - be just like Powder Gangers to hit and run.
GID00004416	See what you can find in the Town Hall, there might be survivors.
GID00004417	In Nipton? Hell no. Town was a shithole, asking to be burned. Just not by Legion. Nobody deserves that.
GID00004418	Unless you burned the town, don't take blame that's not due. Things are going to get uglier before the year's out.
GID00004419	Well, thanks for hoofing it there and back, even if it was bad news. Wish we could spare the troops to go hunting, but... orders are to stay put.
GID00004420	Fucking Mojave's going to hell, and all I can do is sit here and watch.
GID00004421	Interested now? All right.
GID00004422	Good news for a change. Your efforts have humbled me, outsider. You have done more than I could expect, even from my Brothers.
GID00004423	Moreover, I've been going over the scouts' reports and keep coming up with the same conclusion. The NCR is not the threat I've believed it to be.
GID00004424	We should not have had to rely on your help in this crisis. I believed my actions were guided by caution and prudence, but I now see the truth.
GID00004425	People called me a hero after what happened at HELIOS, but I left that battle scarred by fear, and have allowed that weakness to govern my actions.
GID00004426	That ends now. I will undo the wrong I have done my brethren, and lift the lockdown. With luck, we will once again flourish.
GID00004427	Please, take this. It is a small token of my thanks, and scarcely begins to repay the debt owed you, but is all I am allowed to give an outsider.
GID00004428	This key will allow you to use our safehouse to the northeast. I hope it will prove useful in your travels.
GID00004429	Please make all haste in your search. It is imperative that I know the results of his mission.
GID00004430	So, you're the outsider that's been given leave to wander around freely. Desperate times call for desperate measures, I guess.
GID00004431	Name's Hardin. I'm the Head Paladin of this chapter, and I think we might be able to help each other out.
GID00004432	I don't know what the Elder talked to you about, but I can tell you this chapter is in trouble, and he's at the center of it.
GID00004433	Are you willing to listen to what I have to say?
GID00004434	Good, let's take a look... Hmmm, if I'm reading this right, it appears that the NCR's grip on this region is nowhere near as firm as I thought.
GID00004435	I'll have to review these in detail, but these reports have given me much to think about. Thank you, outsider.
GID00004436	You've become someone I can count on, so I believe I can share something rather confidential with you.
GID00004437	Well, return when you have.
GID00004438	Not on my watch you won't. You either go with me to the Elder or I put you in the ground right here. Choose.
GID00004439	Your call.
GID00004440	Yeah? Maybe you can introduce them to me if we find them, because I've never met one.
GID00004441	Don't worry - I'm not that good of a player.
GID00004442	All right.
GID00004443	It's like looking into a mirror. A tacky, cowboy-festooned mirror.
GID00004444	Eesh. These soldiers look how I feel, boss.
GID00004445	See, that's why you should retire before your brain goes. Oh. Sorry, boss. Bad choice of words.
GID00004446	I can't believe I'm about to do this, boss. If I buy it out there, I want twelve mariachi bands playing at my funeral. A medal might be nice, too.
GID00004447	Just putting this out there, boss: if these Super mutants kidnap us and force us to fix toasters for them, it's on you.
GID00004448	Cheer up, kid. It's not that bad. Sure, your skin rots off and you start to stink like a public toilet after Cinco de Mayo, but... umm....
GID00004449	What? How is that not bad? In fact, how could it get worse?
GID00004450	Well, assuming you survive the radiation sickness, the lynch mobs, and the possibility of going feral, one day you'll get old and decrepit, like me.
GID00004451	Oh god!
GID00004452	What? Was it something I said?
GID00004453	Ah, he's young, boss. He'll bounce back. Unlike some of us.
GID00004454	Hey, I'm one of you! Don't eat me, eat the smoothskin! Oh, uh, sorry boss.
GID00004455	I guess hunting down ghouls like wild animals is okay. I mean, they're probably going to die anyways, right boss?
GID00004456	That wig is going to haunt my nightmares. Seriously.
GID00004457	Well, up north a ways you'll see a big tower. That's HELIOS One. Used to be a power plant in its day.
GID00004458	And there's a town just east of here called Nelson. Used to be such a quaint little place until those slavers took it over.
GID00004459	But we got our wonderful snipers keeping an eye in that direction, and so far the slavers have left us alone.
GID00004460	Please don't hurt us no more. I'm begging you.
GID00004461	We'll... we'll pay you. Whatever we got, you can have it. We'll put together a collection every couple of days.
GID00004462	We'll leave it under a rock beneath the old windmill. Think of it as a... as a sign of respect.
GID00004463	Shit. You sound like the LT. I should've w-woken up. I shouldn't have gotten knocked out in the f-first place.
GID00004464	That shit was my fault. I don't want to talk about it anymore, all right?
GID00004465	She's my g-g-goddamn partner. See, we work in pairs. We spot for each other. W-watch each other's backs.
GID00004466	Nobody wanted to w-work with me. They said I was too green. But Betsy volunteered. Shit, you don't even know how big a d-d-deal that is.
GID00004467	She trusts her life to the newbie, and I sit there and let her get raped by that... p-p-piece of shit.
GID00004468	N-no problem.
GID00004469	Oh, y-yeah. My s-stuttering was w-w-way worse before.
GID00004470	He got better? If he says so. Anyway, 10 of Spades is a good kid - maybe I ought to listen to him for once.
GID00004471	I'm guessing the other two had similar things to say. All right, consider me convinced. I'll go see Usanagi.
GID00004472	You can tell the Lieutenant that I caved. And... thanks.
GID00004473	Bitter-Root actually said that? I can't see him talking about his problems to anybody, much less admitting that someone else actually helped him.
GID00004474	I always wondered about that. First Recon is elite, but the rangers... I can't imagine what it'd be like to lose that kind of status.
GID00004475	[SUCCEEDED] I like the way you think. Oratory may indeed be a useful tool in our arsenal if wielded effectively.
GID00004476	I'll put together a debate curriculum and pull out some of those old philosophy books.
GID00004477	[FAILED] Talking? Seriously? Sorry pal, but nothing is more persuasive than bullets and bombs, and we're the experts!
GID00004478	I could probably put together a debate curriculum and pull out some of those old philosophy books.
GID00004479	[SUCCEEDED] That sounds good for teaching the kids how to negotiate prices. I keep saying we need to open trade with the outside, but no one listens.
GID00004480	[FAILED] It doesn't look like we're going to be trading with anyone outside of Nellis anytime soon, so I'd rather not bother.
GID00004481	[SUCCEEDED] Wow, our stockpiles mostly included full metal jacket. I should start a reloading class for the children to learn how to make ammunition!
GID00004482	[FAILED] Look around Nellis. We've got a stockpile of weapons, and we've all spent plenty of time at the range.
GID00004483	I appreciate the sentiment, but there isn't much you could teach us when it comes to firearms.
GID00004484	[SUCCEEDED] Hey, that's a great idea! This information might help with our training manuals, and maybe create a few new apprentices for Loyal.
GID00004485	[FAILED] Right... when we repair stuff, we tend to use welding torches and plasma cutters. I think I still with Loyal and Jack for repair knowledge.
GID00004486	Okay.
GID00004487	Okay children, it's time to read another chapter from The Patriot's Cookbook.
GID00004488	Today, children, we are going to read another chapter from True Police Stories.
GID00004489	Children, today we're going to read more from the Milsurp Review.
GID00004490	For today's studies, please read the next chapter in Programmer's Digest.
GID00004491	Okay children, today we are going to be reading Lad's Life.
GID00004492	Looking to step on your own grave?
GID00004493	Not every day you come back to your gravesite.
GID00004494	Heard the Doc here is a good guy.
GID00004495	Crimson Caravan had some trouble here.
GID00004496	Hill where you got shot?
GID00004497	Think that was a mistake.
GID00004498	No call for that.
GID00004499	Could have handled that better.
GID00004500	What I would have done.
GID00004501	You handled that well.
GID00004502	Good job.
GID00004503	That was fucked up.
GID00004504	Can't believe you did that.
GID00004505	Just when I think I'd seen it all.
GID00004506	That was lower than low.
GID00004507	Set an example, others will follow.
GID00004508	Proud of you.
GID00004509	Color me impressed.
GID00004510	That night, Cass kicked in the door of his room to celebrate, only to find the man on the bed was an NCR soldier whose barracks had been destroyed.
GID00004511	He was cute, though, so after having her way with him, she got the hell out, leaving an empty whiskey bottle as a note.
GID00004512	As she walked along the Dam in the night, she felt drunk, content, and happy to be alive. Which to her, was the whole point of it all.
GID00004513	She was about to tell the Courier not to get too proud of himself, then she figured he knew that already.
GID00004514	She was about to tell the Courier not to get too proud of herself, then she figured she knew that already.
GID00004515	So she laughed, said fuck it all, and raised a bottle to the Dam and the ones who had fought for it.
GID00004516	As far as she was concerned, the whole thing was proof that playing out a bad hand can pay off in the end...
GID00004517	...as long as someone like the Courier was holding the cards.
GID00004518	...as long as a woman like the Courier was holding the cards.
GID00004519	Bad guys won't see us coming.
GID00004520	Shhhh... we're hunting shitheads.
GID00004521	Holding my breath.
GID00004522	Keeping quiet.
GID00004523	O... kay. I'll do my best.
GID00004524	Just as a warning, my covert bandaging skills are a little rusty.
GID00004525	Staying low.
GID00004526	Keeping quiet... unless my creaking knees give us away.
GID00004527	Sure, boss. The old man will crawl around in the dirt to keep hidden.
GID00004528	This crouch-walking is hell on my back, boss.
GID00004529	Right, because a ghoul in a vaquero outfit is really going to blend in with the scenery.
GID00004530	Oh, don't you worry about me, dearie, your grandma knows how to stay quiet.
GID00004531	Knight, he's at Mojave outpost.
GID00004532	Roger.
GID00004533	Roger, I'll radio them over now.
GID00004534	It's your choice, but those rangers are only coming if we get our support.
GID00004535	Don't mention it. It's what I'm here for.
GID00004536	Didn't have much choice, I'm afraid. But I understand the sentiment.
GID00004537	Started? Took to it like a fish to water... well, if you know what a fish is.
GID00004538	It's this... slimy, scaled thing, like a Lakelurk, except no legs. Well, most times. They're like birds, except they stay underwater.
GID00004539	Anyway, I've seen pictures. One guy even had one above his bar in Redding, except it was made of Pre-War plastic.
GID00004540	Used to say it could sing, but I figured he was on a Jet rush.
GID00004541	Well... of course I do.
GID00004542	Actually, it sort of fell on me. My feet get antsy if I stay in one place, like the Mojave Outpost.
GID00004543	Was driving me crazy, that feeling of being trapped there, so thanks for that.
GID00004544	Yeah. West, East - and passed through places enough times people would sometimes pay me some caps to take something to the next town.
GID00004545	Well, not as glamorous, I guess - roads back West were safer in most places. Most.
GID00004546	Anyway, occurred to me I could scratch the traveling itch and get paid for it. Cassidy Caravans formed around me, rest is history.
GID00004547	Well, I'm not one for soft living... or soft men, let me tell you. I'm guessing neither are you.
GID00004548	Well, I'm not one for soft living or soft men, let me tell you. Otherwise, I wouldn't be talking to you right now - on both counts.
GID00004549	What? Oh. Damn, no offense meant. Sometimes I get so drunk, I don't care who I share a bed with, so that's fine with me.
GID00004550	My point before? Is that you know the Mojave, and it's a hard place.
GID00004551	Well, don't let the soldiers drink too much, and I'd agree with you most time. Fucking whiskey dicks.
GID00004552	What? Oh. All right. Guess you've got a Legion outlook on things. No problems here, there's a lot more of that in the Mojave than you see.
GID00004553	Don't take that as anything more than my words. I bet you're a real sweetheart the way you leave that trail of broken-hearts behind you.
GID00004554	I know your look, you probably say all the right things... so we're clear, nothing's going to happen between us. You'd best respect that.
GID00004555	Much as anyone else. Cazador trap - you fly in, the city sucks a pint out of you, then you're out on the street.
GID00004556	NCR makes a habit of going there and dumping cash, only the Strip gets fat off it.
GID00004557	Couldn't tell you much more than that. Not really one for New Vegas when there's enough dumpwater bars in the Mojave to last me.
GID00004558	The Caravan fighting here in the Mojave... it's been downright brutal. The amount of caravan space you reserve for ammo alone...
GID00004559	And if it's not raiders, Powder Gangers, it's NCR tolls. They need to get the money from somewhere, even if it's Vegas-bound.
GID00004560	Anyone wise does. Vegas families pay on time, from what I've heard - even the Omertas. The White Gloves pay on time, but they're... creepy.
GID00004561	Deal with anyone else, though, you're taking a big risk.
GID00004562	Well, no idea why your friend Mr. House wants it, but I'm guessing it's not for the caps.
GID00004563	Must've been one huge metal Bighorner that crapped that chip out.
GID00004564	My guess? Leads to a big cashout at some casino - and if the "38" on it is any indication... well... Lucky 38 it is.
GID00004565	The Legion? What about them?
GID00004566	I don't trade caps or supply anyone who keeps slaves, and treats women like Brahmin in those... "camps" of theirs.
GID00004567	Look, not meaning to fly off the handle like that.
GID00004568	There's some caravans that deal with the Legion, yes. And as much as it pains me to say it, any caravan marked by the Legion is safe as houses.
GID00004569	They guard their roads, their supply lines - even Fiends would hesitate before going after any trader dealing with Legion.
GID00004570	I am. If NCR took the same stand and committed patrols to the roads, then I think that'd solve a lot of their problems right there.
GID00004571	But they don't. Caravans get butchered in the Mojave all the time, like mine. And so fucking close to Vegas, you could see it from the wall.
GID00004572	NCR tries. It's just that trying doesn't mean a whole lot when you're paying your respects to the dead.
GID00004573	And Legion, from what I've heard, they don't do the "stop tolls" on the roads or in the outposts like some NCR quartermasters do.
GID00004574	You're lucky if you turn a profit sometimes if some new officer gets assigned a route, the fees just get worse.
GID00004575	Much as I hate the Legion, caravan life would be a hell of a lot easier if they ran the roads.
GID00004576	Well, as long as those companies were run by men. And that's the biggest issue I see.
GID00004577	And it's a shame, but I think there's people on the NCR side who feel more strongly than I do.
GID00004578	NCR's my country, and I support it. Anyone who says otherwise, I'll feed them my knee.
GID00004579	I know which side of the firing line I'm on in the Mojave, just so you know.
GID00004580	Yeah, there is.
GID00004581	I'm not some blind, flag-saluting do-as-they-will NCR lover. They're family, but let me tell you what family means.
GID00004582	You ever had a brother? Some dumbass younger brother, say, who knocked up the pastor's daughter, can't hold a job, and his home-away is a jail cell?
GID00004583	That's NCR. Their compass is spinning, all the time.
GID00004584	They try to put their stake in everything they see.
GID00004585	Nobody's dick's that long, not even Long Dick Johnson, and he had a fucking long dick. Thus, the name.
GID00004586	So NCR, tries to hold on to everything. They can't, because it's too big for them to get their arms around.
GID00004587	They can't guard the roads, they can't put a line of troops around the Mojave... it's just greed that makes the heads back West even try.
GID00004588	Aside from the people in the towns, it's the soldiers that suffer for it most.
GID00004589	Ever seen NCR troops asked to go after gangs at three-to-one odds? That bear flag doesn't make them bulletproof.
GID00004590	And when those gangs were caused by NCR in the first place, like the Powder Gangers? Caesar on a crutch, don't get me started there.
GID00004591	Look, don't get me wrong.
GID00004592	I wouldn't want the Brotherhood or the Followers or the Vegas families running the Mojave, all of them are a different kind of fuck-up.
GID00004593	NCR just has some shaping up to do. Maybe Caesar kicking them in the nuts is a nice wake-up call, is all I'm saying.
GID00004594	I just wish Caesar would kick the heads of NCR, not the feet. I've fucked a soldier in my time - they don't need to get fucked by their orders.
GID00004595	Look... and what I'm about to say, I don't mean as any offense to you, I know where your sympathies lie.
GID00004596	Some caravans deal with the Legion now because the security. If towns could get the same protection? A lot more tempting than you'd think.
GID00004597	A bunch of people would be willing to side with the Legion to not have to worry about Fiends and Boomers and Powder Ganger attacks.
GID00004598	It's not hard for some folks to sell freedom when the alternative is worse. Especially if being with NCR is going to get you on a Legion cross.
GID00004599	Oh, I'm sure. Killing never felt so good, could almost hear the dead behind me guiding my hand.
GID00004600	Now that that bitch is in hell, they'll have a shot at her, too. So what are we waiting for? We've got more work to do.
GID00004601	Music to my ears.
GID00004602	Yeah... yeah, I am. Never realized had all that anger in me. Makes me wonder how much more I can settle with bullets.
GID00004603	You know, when I first heard about them, I was so mad, but there was this little part of me that said, "you can't do to them what they did to you."
GID00004604	I say fuck that part. I feel purified, and I love the fact that there's no more loose ends.
GID00004605	That's it. Except for one thing... thanks.
GID00004606	Not many people in my company would have done what you did for me without some hesitation or asking me to cool down.
GID00004607	But you backed me, even when the odds were against us. Words aren't enough, but - thanks.
GID00004608	Feels... I don't know. I guess I feel relieved. I don't know what I feel.
GID00004609	Wait, that's not true. I think the NCR back West, when riled, is going to be the worst enemy the Van Graffs and the Crimson Caravan ever had.
GID00004610	They're all so mired in procedure and paper out there, the kind of evidence we gave is going to be worse than shooting them.
GID00004611	I think that settles accounts with me - and my men. That was some tricky political maneuvering, but worth it, even if it takes a few years.
GID00004612	No... no, I know. Just hard to say how I feel right now.
GID00004613	Don't care much for which one we kill first, whether settling accounts with McLafferty or making that bitch Gloria eat her hair.
GID00004614	The Van Graffs are going to be tougher, so we'll likely get killed there. If we go to the Crimson Caravan camp, we'll just need a lot of bullets.
GID00004615	Still, we give the Van Graffs the what-for, that means all those guns they used on my caravan - we can take and use on the Crimson Caravan.
GID00004616	NCR? Are you out of your fucking mind?
GID00004617	That'd take years... and with the war with the Legion, no way they're going to waste time running up the Crimson Caravan or the Van Graffs!
GID00004618	And what makes you think any evidence can be found?
GID00004619	All right, if you poke around the Van Graffs and Alice, fine.
GID00004620	But if I see either one, go into their camp? I'm going to start shooting, no matter what you find.
GID00004621	So there's just one more safe to crack? Hope you can get to it.
GID00004622	Say what you will about the two leading ladies, they watch their lockers like crows. Still... you got one, so the other might not be impossible.
GID00004623	If you get both, then let's talk. And... I appreciate you putting yourself at risk like this. Thanks.
GID00004624	No shit. There it is, the blood, the motive, as clear as day. They must have penned these with snake venom.
GID00004625	But... we got it, now what? Sure, this damns them, but only if someone listens.
GID00004626	I held off on filling them full of holes, so unless you give me a good reason to cool my heels soon, I'm not waiting much longer.
GID00004627	You're saying... they might need to do the same thing to each other some day. And evidence is easier than bullets.
GID00004628	No... No, I'd agree with that. And Alice and Gloria are two crows that'd keep something like that in their nest.
GID00004629	Well... Jackson in the Mojave Outpost could get it to folks in the West. I wouldn't trust anyone closer to the Colorado.
GID00004630	And the Crimson Caravan and the Van Graffs have their heart back West. Not sure it'll do any good, though.
GID00004631	All right, let's do it, listen to what he has to say.
GID00004632	Up side of Vegas, hear tell. Trapped at the Mojave Outpost, so I wasn't able to run there when I heard.
GID00004633	Been weeks since it was hit, so the site's probably a Cazador nest by now.
GID00004634	Got word back on what happened from Rangers, guess they found enough in the wreckage to identify it.
GID00004635	Only wishful thinking on my part, most likely. At the least, I'd like to pay my respects.
GID00004636	I got them into this mess, I owe them that much.
GID00004637	Well, I still wouldn't mind going there and crossing my heart a few times, if only to make me feel a bit better.
GID00004638	I got them into this mess, I owe them that much.
GID00004639	Thanks, I appreciate it.
GID00004640	Some of the caravan might be ash, but we were expecting raiders and over-inquisitive NCR border guards. There might be something left.
GID00004641	If I'm there with you, shouldn't be hard to spot. And I'd prefer to see the bodies with my own eyes.
GID00004642	Well, you have to know what to look for.
GID00004643	No idea. Maybe catch the sun in their eyes? Maybe they wanted the caravan to come to them, walk into an ambush?
GID00004644	We should check the wagon, they may not have got everything.
GID00004645	Whatever we find, it's yours - least I can do for hoofing it all this way with me.
GID00004646	Not sure, let's look around.
GID00004647	Yeah, it's a ways, though, hell of a detour. You sure?
GID00004648	Yeah, something's wrong, I can feel it.
GID00004649	It's not any closer than the first, so if you'd rather let be, let me know.
GID00004650	All right then, let's move out.
GID00004651	Don't have to tell me twice, feel more alive than I ever have.
GID00004652	Oh. Well, all right.
GID00004653	Soldiers, no, recruits, yes. And the Mojave Outpost has been ordered to have a standing force at the NCR perimeter at all times.
GID00004654	So sending anyone out reduces the Outpost's numbers and would be in direct violation of my orders from back West.
GID00004655	Sending more troops, yes, to reinforce the Outpost, no. Troops head through here on their way to McCarran or to the frontlines at Forlorn Hope.
GID00004656	Or they're on leave, on their way to New Vegas to piss away their pay. All of them, passing through.
GID00004657	Frustrated? No. I have my orders - signed, and approved all the way up the chain from Kimball. And I understand the reasons.
GID00004658	The Outpost isn't a Legion target, yet, not like Vegas or the Dam - but if the caravans get choked here, that's going to bite NCR hard.
GID00004659	Anyway, didn't mean to talk your ear off. Some days... just feel like more requisition forms and daily reports come across my desk than results.
GID00004660	What is it? Let me see.
GID00004661	All right. This is... this explains a lot of the lost caravans. I thought it was Legion work, but...
GID00004662	No. No, I can't. Because this evidence might be true... but it doesn't just implicate them.
GID00004663	It's a motive for what happened up North, someone went cruising through both compounds, killed them all.
GID00004664	I'm guessing that was you. If so, you're not leaving this outpost except in chains.
GID00004665	I can, if you make me a promise.
GID00004666	I need you to swear you won't take revenge on Gloria or Alice. If you do, then your case is over, and we can't see that justice is done.
GID00004667	I know some things are hard to let go, but you and Miss Cassidy need to understand that, hear me?
GID00004668	That'll have to do. God, what a mess. People turning against each other when the Mojave's at risk of falling?
GID00004669	If the Republics sinkhole-progress doesn't kill us, greed will. Thanks for bringing me this, I know revenge must have been tempting.
GID00004670	For what it's worth, I appreciate you didn't shed any more blood. We need to save our strength for the Legion.
GID00004671	God, what a mess. People turning against each other when the Mojave's at risk of falling?
GID00004672	If the Republics sinkhole-progress doesn't kill us, greed will. Thanks for bringing me this, I know revenge must have been tempting.
GID00004673	For what it's worth, I appreciate you didn't shed any more blood. We need to save our strength for the Legion.
GID00004674	Hmmm. All right - you change your mind and start shooting, then I can't help you. Show up here after, I'll put you in chains.
GID00004675	Get on now, I'll make sure this gets West and let the wheels of law start turning in the courts.
GID00004676	I can promise that, what happens after... not even God himself could move the Congress in or out of session. And this... this is a tricky matter.
GID00004677	I'll do what I can - and those folks that got killed need to be answered for.
GID00004678	No, I mentioned you might accidentally get supplied, and I meant it. Not allowed to contract mercenaries at the Outpost.
GID00004679	Still, a requisition form or two can get lost, and they're not going to come check... so here you go, just between us.
GID00004680	Well, about time we got a soldier... and not a recruit, you look like you've seen some action.
GID00004681	Come back when you've made some progress.
GID00004682	All right, then. We'll need a couple ingredients to get started. Gonna want some Xander Root and a Broc Flower.
GID00004683	Lemme think now... I know I've seen Broc Flowers growing up at the graveyard. And I seem to remember there being Xander Root over by the schoolhouse.
GID00004684	Bring those on back to me, and we'll get cooking.
GID00004685	Okay, say no more.
GID00004686	One more thing I wanted to show you.
GID00004687	Thought I might teach you about living off the land, and making useful things for yourself. Interested?
GID00004688	Oh, I see. Well, I guess I'm off to see my admirer now.
GID00004689	They were all dead, then. I suppose I'm not surprised. We have few friends in the world above, and many enemies.
GID00004690	But we must turn our minds to other matters. When I sent out those patrols, I also sent three Knights out on scouting missions.
GID00004691	When the patrols failed to return, we assumed the worst and sent a single communication to the scouts to hold position and maintain radio silence.
GID00004692	I want you to contact those scouts and gather their reports. Like the patrols, they have devices on them that will enable you to track them.
GID00004693	When you find them, tell them you're my representative and ask them if the bears are still hunting. That should get them to talk to you.
GID00004694	Return when you've gathered all of their reports.
GID00004695	While that is disheartening news, there remains hope that the other two patrols may still be found alive.
GID00004696	See me as soon as you've found them.
GID00004697	T-That is unfortunate. As long as there is a chance to find the remaining patrol, however, I must still ask you to try.
GID00004698	Return when you have found them.
GID00004699	Remain diligent, outsider. If those patrols are in trouble, every second you delay lessens their chances of rescue.
GID00004700	Sorry. I assumed the only reason you'd fight past a horde of Super mutants and pick the lock on my cell is if you heard my cry for help on the radio.
GID00004701	But maybe you're just sightseeing. So, since the door's open and all, can I go now?
GID00004702	Name's Raul. Raul Alfonso Tejada. I'm the mechanic around here.
GID00004703	You forget about me already, boss? You sure you didn't take a blow to the head or something?
GID00004704	My name is Raul Alfonso Tejada. Can I leave now, or did you want to ask me again in five minutes?
GID00004705	<Sigh.> No. No, boss, I'm, a prisoner of the crazy Super Mutant with the wig and the glasses. I was kind of hoping you were here to set me free.
GID00004706	But maybe I'm not a pretty enough damsel for that, huh?
GID00004707	Probably because it used to be Miguel's. Whoever he was. How about if you let me go, huh boss?
GID00004708	Talk to me at my shack, I've at least got tools there.
GID00004709	Oh, sure thing. I haven't even remotely grown sick of staring at this place.
GID00004710	What?! No! I mean, I haven't seen her around for a while, but I thought she was just busy working.
GID00004711	She was so beautiful... Now I'll never get to know her.
GID00004712	You think I'm handsome? Wow, I wonder if she does, too!
GID00004713	I thought you weren't interested.
GID00004714	[SUCCEEDED] Oh, I remember now! I was playing hide and seek in the big hangar! Mister Loyal made us leave though.
GID00004715	[FAILED] I don't know. I play all over. I'll never find him!
GID00004716	[SUCCEEDED] Hmm. All right. If his sentence was closing up I can see about getting him pardoned.
GID00004717	Primm is important to our trade up from California, so having someone there who owes us a favor... that couldn't hurt.
GID00004718	[FAILED] I don't think so. I'm not going to put my word on the line for some random convict.
GID00004719	Well, having a sheriff who was a convict is better than no sheriff at all... and if he has the qualifications... all right, hand it over.
GID00004720	If you had 200 caps, we could talk business - until then, we don't have anything to talk about.
GID00004721	Goodbye.
GID00004722	Goodbye.
GID00004723	It has. It was a promising trade town - before the escape at the correctional facility. Lost a good bit of money at the Vikki and Vance.
GID00004724	There is a NCR camp down on the southern border of Nevada. Camp Mojave I think, try to find someone of authority there.
GID00004725	Okay, hurry back. I don't want anyone to start shooting at me.
GID00004726	Alright, ask away.
GID00004727	I have some free time, ask away.
GID00004728	Goodbye.
GID00004729	What we need, more than anything, is bodies.
GID00004730	If we had just one more squad, we could easily install a sheriff and still handle our primary objective of protecting the interstate south of here.
GID00004731	If you'd like to see the NCR include protection of Primm in its duties, then you'll have to get some more troops up here.
GID00004732	Knight, at Mojave outpost, may be able to help.
GID00004733	Okay, well let me know what she says.
GID00004734	I'm glad I can count on you. Oh, and one other thing. The patrols each had a holotape detailing their missions that you can use to track them.
GID00004735	The shielding of the bunker prevents us from actively tracking them, but their positions should show up on your map once you get to the surface.
GID00004736	Should our worst fears become realized, please bring back all three of the holotapes from the patrols. Otherwise, bring our brothers home.
GID00004737	I've given the order that you be given access to some of the equipment our scouts and patrols have scavenged over the years.
GID00004738	You won't be allowed to purchase any prohibited equipment, but hopefully some of what's available will prove useful to you.
GID00004739	I don't think it was as hard hit as DC or Bakersfield, but it was bad enough. By the time we got there, the city was a radioactive ruin.
GID00004740	Still, the city was full of looters, already forming into the beginnings of raider tribes. Crime was bad before the War, but now it was a nightmare.
GID00004741	We were living like scavengers, scraping by on what little food we could find, always looking for medicine for my burns.
GID00004742	And then, of course, the radiation started to kick in, turning me into this handsome devil you see before you.
GID00004743	Oh, sure, boss. I was always good at fixing things. Some I fixed for the town, some I fixed for other people, some I fixed just for the hell of it.
GID00004744	It's a better way to use your hands than killing, and even then I wasn't getting any younger or faster.
GID00004745	I lived there for a long time. Kept to myself, didn't get into any fights - hell, the only reason I even kept my guns oiled was professional pride.
GID00004746	Getting there, boss. I'd been in Tuscon - the locals can call it Two-Sun all they want, but it's Tuscon, dammit - about 75 years when she showed up.
GID00004747	Prettiest thing you ever saw, boss. Maybe it was just a trick of my senile brain, but I swear she looked just like my Rafaela. Her name was Claudia.
GID00004748	She ended up taking work at one of the brothels in town. I never went to her, of course - how could I? But I looked after her in my own way.
GID00004749	This was a long time ago. Before Caesar's Legion pacified Arizona and brought the raider tribes to heel.
GID00004750	A tribe came into Tuscon one day - more a gang, really. Dirty Dave and his six brothers. They were looking for bullets, and I sold some to them.
GID00004751	I figured if I did that, they'd leave town before they tore it up too much.
GID00004752	No, boss. No they didn't.
GID00004753	As I was saying, I hoped they'd leave the town in peace. Instead, they decided to stop at Claudia's brothel to take the edge off.
GID00004754	I don't know which one of them got rowdy first, but by the time I heard the screams and got my guns, it was too late.
GID00004755	They'd shot up the brothel, killed four girls, and taken Claudia for their sport.
GID00004756	I went after Dave and his brothers. They had a head start, but they slept nights. I didn't. Took me three days to catch up to them.
GID00004757	Claudia was dead when I got there. They'd put a bullet in each of her eyes. I couldn't do anything except avenge her, just like Rafaela.
GID00004758	I charged into the middle of their camp and started firing - two of them were dead before they knew I was there. The other five, though....
GID00004759	They shot the shit out of me. I would have died, I think, if I wasn't so full of rage.
GID00004760	By being a meaner old cuss than the rest of them, boss. I wanted to keep living until they weren't, so I just kept shooting until they were all dead.
GID00004761	I was in pretty bad shape in the end, though. I don't know how long I laid there with the sun baking me and the buzzards chomping at me.
GID00004762	Eventually I got the strength to start moving. Some long time after that, I managed to drag my carcass back to town.
GID00004763	When I recovered - more or less, anyways - I left Tuscon and headed west. I ran into Tabitha at Black Mountain and, well, the rest you know.
GID00004764	I swore I was done with the gunslinging life - I was too old, too slow, and too beat up to protect anyone anymore.
GID00004765	I thought I was done forever... but after traveling with you, I realize I've always had my doubts.
GID00004766	When I recovered - more or less, anyways - I left Tuscon and headed west. I ran into Tabitha at Black Mountain and, well, the rest you know.
GID00004767	I swore I was done with the gunslinging life - I was too old, too slow, and too beat up to protect anyone anymore.
GID00004768	After seeing what you go through, I think I made the right choice. So thanks for that, boss.
GID00004769	When I recovered - more or less, anyways - I left Tuscon and headed west. I ran into Tabitha at Black Mountain and, well, the rest you know.
GID00004770	I swore I was done with the gunslinging life - I was too old, too slow, and too beat up to protect anyone anymore.
GID00004771	I thought I was done forever... but after traveling with you, I realize that was the wrong decision. So thanks for that, boss.
GID00004772	About whether I still had what it took to carry my pistols proudly, to use them to do what's right.
GID00004773	And now that I've been traveling with you for a while, you've made me realize that I can still do that.
GID00004774	Maybe I'm not as tough as I used to be, but my brains can make up for that, and my hands are still quick enough. It's time to put the guns back on.
GID00004775	About whether I'm really too old to keep living the life of a gunslinger after all. And after seeing what you go through, boss, I think I am.
GID00004776	From now on, I'll let you deal with the fighting and stick to keeping your gear working. I don't want to slow you down more than I already do.
GID00004777	You can bet on that, boss.
GID00004778	Thanks, boss. I'd hate to think I was disappointing you with my life-altering decision.
GID00004779	[SUCCEEDED] I suppose you're right, boss. These bones are too old for that kind of action.
GID00004780	[FAILED] I'm sure you've got a lot of ideas, boss, but how about if you let me make this decision?
GID00004781	Tell you what, I'll at least think about it for a while. Ask me about it again another time.
GID00004782	[SUCCEEDED] You think so? Well... you're the boss. Okay, I'll give it a try.
GID00004783	But if I get killed, and if there's an afterlife, I'll haunt your ass.
GID00004784	[SUCCEEDED] Not at all! I'm never sure how much is normally charged for this sort of thing. Here's some additional caps - that should be enough.
GID00004785	Now, how about spending some of those caps in the saloon?
GID00004786	[FAILED] I could get another working radio with the caps I already gave you. Now, how about spending some of those caps right now?
GID00004787	Well well, this is welcome news. Who is she?
GID00004788	She's with those traders? They've tried to contact us before, but I'm not interested in trading with greedy savages.
GID00004789	This presents a bit of a problem. Jack isn't allowed to leave Nellis, and I doubt she would make it through the artillery alive.
GID00004790	This presents a bit of a problem. Jack isn't allowed to leave Nellis, and I doubt she would make it through the artillery alive.
GID00004791	[SUCCEEDED] Hmm, I suppose Jack deserves a chance at love. You can tell Jack she has a free pass to enter, but he is responsible for her actions.
GID00004792	Do not make me regret this decision, outsider.
GID00004793	[FAILED] Sorry, but I can't risk exposing the tribe to more savage outsiders.
GID00004794	[SUCCEEDED] You're right. I'd be wrong to deny Jack such joy in his life.
GID00004795	He's done right by the tribe many times over. Tell Jack this girl is free to enter, but he is responsible for her actions.
GID00004796	Do not make me regret this decision, outsider.
GID00004797	Very well, I'll take your word when you say she isn't a threat to the tribe. I will allow her entry if Jack will take responsibility for her.
GID00004798	Do not make me regret this decision, outsider.
GID00004799	Sorry, but I can't risk exposing the tribe to more savage outsiders.
GID00004800	Very well.
GID00004801	I'd rather not allow more outsiders in, but I'll hear you out.
GID00004802	Thanks. Watch your back out there. Never know when those Legion bastards might show up.
GID00004803	What is it, Veronica?
GID00004804	Hardin. Er, Elder. I know why we're failing.
GID00004805	Do you?
GID00004806	As long as we hide in here, ignoring the outside, our days are numbered.
GID00004807	For once, I agree.
GID00004808	You do?
GID00004809	We can't let people go on believing the Brotherhood has lost its teeth.
GID00004810	We must strike while our enemies are distracted with each other.
GID00004811	Strike? That's how we got into this problem in the first place. We can't beat these armies.
GID00004812	Our entire two hundred years of history say that a handful of troops with the best equipment and training can stand up to any army.
GID00004813	And the loss of HELIOS One says things are different now.
GID00004814	That was a failure of strategy, not philosophy. If Father El- the Elder in charge were a Paladin and not a Scribe-
GID00004815	Our arrogance would still have been our downfall.
GID00004816	History says otherwise.
GID00004817	Maybe it's time you start looking forward.
GID00004818	Let's go. We're wasting our time.
GID00004819	Yeah, boss?
GID00004820	[FAILED] I'm sure you've got a lot of ideas, boss, but how about if you let me make this decision?
GID00004821	Tell you what, I'll at least think about it for a while. Ask me about it again another time.
GID00004822	Really? Thanks for the reminder, boss, I'd almost forgotten.
GID00004823	You're a poet of understatement, boss. But there were moments it was almost worth it. I still remember finding that novelty costume shop.
GID00004824	I was just looking for something I could slice up to wrap my burns when I saw the vaquero outfit hanging on the rack, like it hadn't been touched.
GID00004825	I took it - not like anybody else needed it, you know? - and wore it back to our camp. Rafaela laughed for the first time since the bombs had fallen.
GID00004826	It was. I started to build up a legend. Sometimes it headed off trouble, but most of the time it just started more.
GID00004827	Young punks looking to prove themselves would come looking for me, but my eyes were sharp and my guns were quick.
GID00004828	For a whle it seemed like we might even survive there, until... until Rafaela.
GID00004829	She went out to find some food one day. I was sick, so I stayed at our camp. I guess it must have been the beginnings of radiation poisoning.
GID00004830	Anyway, it was supposed to be safe, but some raiders happened to pass through where she was scavenging. I won't speak of what they did to her.
GID00004831	When I found her body, the only way to recognize her was this funny little scar on her knee from when she was a little girl.
GID00004832	Terrible doesn't begin to cover it, boss. I'd let my whole family down - first the ranch, now Rafaela. I was the last Tejada.
GID00004833	I guess maybe I went a little crazy then. I took my guns, and I went back to that market. I didn't have many bullets, but I had enough.
GID00004834	After the raiders were dead, I salvaged what I could from the store. I was tired... I just wanted to be alone forever.
GID00004835	I left Mexico City behind. I made my way out to the Gulf Coast, eventually I found an old Petro-Chico refinery nobody had claimed.
GID00004836	I stayed there for a little while, and I thought a lot about my life. I thought about the guns I'd lived by and what they'd gotten me.
GID00004837	I decided my guns hadn't gotten me anything, and it was time to give it up. I took off that old vaquero outfit, and put on a Petro-Chico jumpsuit.
GID00004838	The name tag said "Miguel," so I started using the name myself. Eventually I made it to Arizona... but that's another story, boss.
GID00004839	Yup.
GID00004840	[SUCCEEDED] Robbed some people, burned some things, killed a few guys.
GID00004841	[FAILED] Like I said, mind your own damn business.
GID00004842	Yeah, forget about it.
GID00004843	Vale.
GID00004844	Sure do. I run the courier office out of my shop. Leastaways I did before things went to hell around here.
GID00004845	Primm? Hayes' unit is stationed up there, were having problems with some of the NCRCF convicts. What can I help you with?
GID00004846	I'd like to help - but we can't spare any more units. We have to maintain a minimum headcount at the Outpost, orders from the West.
GID00004847	One of the Powder Gangers? They've been nothing but trouble for us - why would we want one of them anywhere in an official capacity?
GID00004848	[SUCCEEDED] I see the wisdom in that. I'll radio for a unit to head up to Primm and offer some additional support.
GID00004849	[FAILED] NCR is not in the habit of buying and selling towns... unless that was some sort of joke on your part.
GID00004850	Fine, I will, jackass.
GID00004851	You can have your shit back, I don't need it or want it. You go your way, I'm going mine.
GID00004852	And don't try looking for me - it was a mistake to show up in the Mojave in the first place, and I'm not about to repeat that mistake twice.
GID00004853	You son of a bitch. You know, I was just going to give you a piece of my mind and now? Now I'm going to put you down.
GID00004854	Who you are comes from the choices you make when life gets tough.
GID00004855	So if you're saying that life is dragging you down, I don't buy it. You better start changing your attitude, or I'm heading back West, you hear?
GID00004856	You're seriously going to draw on me? Fine, do it, see what happens.
GID00004857	[SUCCEEDED] Well... all right. I'll stick around for a little while longer, but if you get out of line again...
GID00004858	[FAILED] That's your excuse?
GID00004859	[SUCCEEDED] Well... all right. I'll stick around for a little while longer, but if you get out of line again...
GID00004860	[FAILED] That's your excuse?
GID00004861	[SUCCEEDED] I'll hold you to that promise, then. I'm not known for my patience, though.
GID00004862	[FAILED] Inside? Yeah, must be deep inside, all right.
GID00004863	[SUCCEEDED] All right... maybe I was a little harsh. I can be that way.
GID00004864	[FAILED] Trying's the same thing as giving up, the way you're saying it.
GID00004865	You need to be tougher. If you let the Mojave get you down, then you've given up on life.
GID00004866	So straighten out, stop being so shifty and... downright mean, and see if that doesn't change your outlook.
GID00004867	Fuck that. You can walk the road to hell on your own.
GID00004868	All right, then.
GID00004869	No. This is something for me to deal with. But I'm glad you're here.
GID00004870	NCR border guard duty mostly. It's our job to make sure the caravans can move safely along I-15 and Highway 95.
GID00004871	Not the best posting or assignment, but it beats being sent East, or patrolling the Colorado. Legion's pretty thick there.
GID00004872	Me, I'm Knight - Major Knight. I've been stuck here dealing with these caravans for ages now, but somebody's gotta do it.
GID00004873	It ain't so bad. If Caesar's Legion decides to push West through Nipton ol' Mojave Outpost here will be the front line.
GID00004874	A man who shot you.
GID00004875	Fine, then, not trying to pry. Just wondering what would make a Courier run around the desert without a contract is all. Forget I asked.
GID00004876	And you got better.
GID00004877	Two shots in the head without an Auto-Doc is a lot of patching. Hope you thanked him properly.
GID00004878	Who's this snake that put bullets in your head? Did he have cause, or...?
GID00004879	So he robbed you? Robbing a courier's low, and any family or group he's with is going to get a black eye for it.
GID00004880	Caravan code of the wastes is you don't fuck with the one who brings you your mail, and you don't fuck with your supply line.
GID00004881	Hope this shithead knows what he's in for. From both of us... what's his name?
GID00004882	Well if it wasn't before, it is now.
GID00004883	Did he bother to introduce himself, or did he not take you for somebody who'd get up again when killed?
GID00004884	Can't say I've heard the name. Or heard about any man dressed like a seat cover.
GID00004885	Bad suit, huh? Well, if assholes had taste, we'd all be feasting on shit.
GID00004886	Still... suit means money, and suits stand out, especially here in the Mojave. One of the larger towns, or Vegas, might be the place to go.
GID00004887	Don't you worry, though, we'll sort this asshole out, rattle his cage a little.
GID00004888	Does it come with its own Deathclaw? Trust me, if you can't see it, something just as nasty's waiting.
GID00004889	Whole Lucky 38... the idea that there's this casino in the middle of a town of people, and only you're ever let inside?
GID00004890	Feels like other places I've been. Something that isolated from everyday folks starts to take on a bad shine.
GID00004891	No, of course not. I... don't know what I'm going to do now with Rhonda back...
GID00004892	It is, Mistress Tabitha. How I've missed you so. This stranger here fixed me up right as rain. Is he a friend of yours?
GID00004893	It is, Mistress Tabitha. How I've missed you so. This stranger here fixed me up right as rain. Is she a friend of yours?
GID00004894	R-Rhonda? Is that you?
GID00004895	It's just... such a shock to see Rhonda up and about again. I'm not sure what to do now.
GID00004896	Mistress Tabitha, we should be heading off. Our journey has been much delayed, but we can catch up if we hurry. Come along, now.
GID00004897	Yes, Rhonda.
GID00004898	Where? Like Vegas? Chewed and spit enough friends out. East? Get put in one of Caesar's little "camps?" No thanks.
GID00004899	Head back West? I already know the Big Circle and everyone in it - 'cept now I go back there, ruined.
GID00004900	Never really realized how small the Mojave's getting nowadays, hard to find a place to go to that's worthwhile.
GID00004901	Hnh. Maybe you're right. Brimmed hats always throw me off.
GID00004902	Well, fine, whatever, they can be shaking each other's dicks, wouldn't change the Mojave now.
GID00004903	I'm fair with chucking dynamite and not bad with a pistol, if I do say so myself. Carry a knife, too, but that's more for practical reasons.
GID00004904	Prefer settling things with my fists, though. Made more friends than corpses in bar fights - plan on keeping it that way.
GID00004905	Don't think I'm some kind of Vault City pacifist, though - if things get heated, I'll start shooting, trust me.
GID00004906	Short of caps is what taught me, mostly. Ammo's expensive... so I learned to make every shot count.
GID00004907	And hear tell, my Dad was a crack shot, so I don't want to dirty the family name. Not out of pride - respect.
GID00004908	Dynamite's for when you don't have enough bullets, want to clear a pass, or scare off Geckos from a caravan.
GID00004909	Some of the twisters out of the Divide can block off a pass in no time, so you learn how to handle powder so you don't get trapped somewhere.
GID00004910	Any event, I prefer shooting if it comes down to an argument. Don't worry, I'll carry my weight if a disagreement arises.
GID00004911	"It's the company?" That has got to be the biggest load of Brahmin shit I've ever heard.
GID00004912	Still, if you got more like that...
GID00004913	Jackson might have something for you, if you haven't already spoken to that old buzzard.
GID00004914	He was looking to try and get troops to clear the north road. You can find him over in the other building - the one without a bar.
GID00004915	So you're looking for someone to help, not just tag along? Hnh.
GID00004916	Oh, that's got just the right bite of judgment to it, stings a little, too. Did you hear that from a Followers preacher?
GID00004917	I bet you could preach all day, who knows what other little bits of wisdom might spill out.
GID00004918	Didn't ask Mom to elaborate. Never heard her complain about his bedroom behavior, only complain he wasn't around to do it no more.
GID00004919	Hnh. The Outpost lost its charm about three bottles ago, and that was just this morning.
GID00004920	So fighting boredom is your argument, huh?
GID00004921	Aside from the TV-faced robots, the dust, and the old man smell in every room? Nothing, it's a paradise.
GID00004922	This place has the Old World Blues about it. Everything in here feels like it should have passed on a long time ago.
GID00004923	Hell, it's hard to believe Vegas is right outside. So, yeah, I'm looking to leave whenever you're ready.
GID00004924	Thank god, the sooner the better.
GID00004925	Not sure if I chose it or it chose me. Dad ran a bar a long time ago, and it was a labor of love, Mom said. Didn't sound like it made her happy.
GID00004926	Still, I'm guessing I got some of Dad's love of whiskey in me, because the burn suits me fine.
GID00004927	Used to call me "Whiskey Rose" back West, before I punched enough people, so now they say it, but quiet and when I'm not around.
GID00004928	Yeah, on account of my name... and the blossoms on my cheeks when I drink too much.
GID00004929	Won most of those fights, too. Can take a hell of a punch and give it right back when I've got a bottle in me.
GID00004930	It's all in how you drink it, though - there's a trick to it. When we pass the bottle, I'll show you how it's done.
GID00004931	Yeah, he's been with NCR so long all he can see is the worst outcome of everything - so he doesn't do anything.
GID00004932	All right? No, I'm not all right.
GID00004933	Drinking to forget, and it's only getting me mad instead. Whiskey always gets my temper up - now more than ever.
GID00004934	Drinking used to cause all sorts of trouble back West - before I punched enough people, that is, and they learned to lay low when the whiskey hit.
GID00004935	Lost my caravan heading north, the driver burned to ash - and they didn't even take the cargo, they just burned that, too.
GID00004936	Yeah, if you couldn't tell, I'm not from around here and I'm not NCR. I run a caravan... or did.
GID00004937	Don't worry, not looking to throw punches just yet. And something tells me hitting you would be a mistake I wouldn't want to repeat.
GID00004938	My guess is Legion, they're trying to cut NCR's supply line... and the Mojave Outpost is proof. Got us locked up tighter than a New Vegas virgin.
GID00004939	No caravans in, out, and just try arguing with Jackson about it. "Roads aren't safe," he says.
GID00004940	No shit, you washed-out old fuckup, I didn't need a Brotherhood Scribe to tell me that.
GID00004941	NCR officer, trooper, whatever - runs the place. He's over in the main building, the one without a bar.
GID00004942	Jackson won't let me head north, it's not safe... and even though my caravan's gone, my caravan papers are keeping me here.
GID00004943	So if you came here for work, my advice? Go find the Crimson Caravan branch, south of Vegas. They can help you out.
GID00004944	Drink. Got a lot of memories to drown. If I die while doing it, so be it. Got nowhere else to go.
GID00004945	Sure am. Burned for the last time, and this time, it's for good. Worse, it's not done kicking me - I'm still trapped here.
GID00004946	Yeah, well, you aren't me, so good-for-fucking-you.
GID00004947	Trouble's already come and went, so anything you bring will make my next drink go down easier.
GID00004948	No shit? Drink's on me, then.
GID00004949	Still, not like I'm going anywhere. Caravan title's still keeping me here, even though it's dead and gone.
GID00004950	You're looking at it. It's a watering hole without much to brag about.
GID00004951	It's like a Brahmin drive gone wrong - supposed to be a gate north, but you come here, you get caught in the pen. Better to head back home.
GID00004952	If you don't have a gun and a will, don't matter much what you do when you reach here, except stare at that fucking monument outside.
GID00004953	Don't even tell me you missed it coming in. It's like NCR showing its dick to all the East.
GID00004954	If the Republic put as much effort into protecting the East as they put into those two asinine giants outside, then they'd be worth that monument.
GID00004955	Statues of two men shaking hands covered in blood don't seem to be nothing to brag about.
GID00004956	I'm speaking figurative, isn't any blood on their damn hands. Course, when Caesar comes walking through here, there'll be blood for real.
GID00004957	And after the blood dries in the sun, he'll melt that piece of Jet-induced sculpture down, and reshape it into a bull.
GID00004958	Which by my reckoning is making up for a deficiency of his. But no matter what the state of his pecker, he's sure giving the West a good fucking.
GID00004959	One's a ranger, one's an NCR trooper, supposed to represent unification of West and East... or some such shit.
GID00004960	As far as those two iron lovebirds go, they've got more spine than you'll see in a year from the NCR government.
GID00004961	Whiskey and me are old friends, keeps me going when times get rough. Like now.
GID00004962	Got me into the caravan business, you know - had to start transporting water instead of liquor, though.
GID00004963	If I hadn't switched over, I'd end my trip with nothing but glass bottles rattling on the back of the Brahmin.
GID00004964	If you're looking to sign on with a caravan, no - traders are bottled up tight here.
GID00004965	Caravan work's up north, check with the Crimson Caravan, maybe. Gun Runners might have work, wouldn't know for sure, though.
GID00004966	Still, if you got a gun, guts, and feeling like going on patrol, might be some of the soldiers around here have work for you.
GID00004967	I don't know, seems to be a lot of attention on Nipton. Word is, one of the snipers in the nest on the roof spotted smoke from the East.
GID00004968	Yeah, her name's... Ghost or something... fucking scary, ooooooh. Guess it's cause you'll never see her 'til your dead.
GID00004969	NCR and their goddamn nicknames, as if Caesar himself's gonna piss and run if he hears them.
GID00004970	Anyway, go on and head up top, ask her what's going on, if you haven't already. I don't much give a shit.
GID00004971	Whatever you say, boss. I'll just stay back here and be quiet in case you have a sudden flash of brilliance you need to share.
GID00004972	Yeah. That's what I thought, too.
GID00004973	Old history, boss.
GID00004974	Yeah, it beats dying alone in the Wasteland because you were too slow.
GID00004975	That fear has always been a part of my life.
GID00004976	Maybe... but what if you miss the old days, sometimes?
GID00004977	A memory from a long time ago.
GID00004978	Sure, boss. Whenever's good for you.
GID00004979	Just a few days after Mexico City was vaporized, refugees started pouring down the road to our ranch. We helped who we could, but there were so many.
GID00004980	Eventually, my father started turning people away before we ran out of food. Things got violent. My father and I got our guns, and we drove them off.
GID00004981	About two dozen men came back in the night, after we'd gone to sleep. They set fire to the ranch house and barred the doors from the outside.
GID00004982	My whole family was trapped inside. I smelled the smoke and got myself and my little sister, Rafaela, out though a window, but everyone else....
GID00004983	My parents, my grandmother, my two brothers and two of my sisters all died.
GID00004984	Rafaela and I ran. We were pursued by some of the men who attacked our home, but I was always a good shot.
GID00004985	The ones who came after us, I killed. The rest, I left be. I had to take care of Rafaela, not throw my life away on revenge.
GID00004986	Maybe. I don't know. All I know is that for all my skill with a pistol, I couldn't help them.
GID00004987	Anyway, that was weighing on my mind. Thanks for letting me get it out in the open, boss.
GID00004988	I know that, boss. That's not what I'm getting at. I'm just getting sentimental in my old age. Anyways, forget it. Just wanted that off my chest.
GID00004989	Maybe we made a mistake. It was early on, we didn't know just how serious it was out there.
GID00004990	But to say they deserved it? What kind of devil are you, boss?
GID00004991	After Hoover Dam, the leaderless Powder Gangers at the Correctional Facility vanished into the wastes, leaving the prison empty.
GID00004992	The Correctional Facility became another abandoned ruin in the wasteland, its carcass occasionally picked over by enterprising prospectors.
GID00004993	With the Dam firmly in their grasp, the NCR turned its attention towards wresting the Correctional Facility from Powder Ganger hands.
GID00004994	The Powder Gangers are no match for the battle-hardened troops of the NCR, and summary execution awaited the Powder Gangers who managed to survive.
GID00004995	Most Powder Gangers at the Correctional Facility fled into the wasteland rather than face the advancing forces of the Legion.
GID00004996	Those brave or foolish to remain were killed or crucified by the merciless Legionaries.
GID00004997	The NCR, battered by the loss of the Dam, were unable to devote any troops to retaking the Correctional Facility from the Powder Gangers.
GID00004998	As a result, Powder Ganger raids on caravans became an unfortunate fact of life in the Mojave for years to come.
GID00004999	And I suppose you're taking credit for the deed, fiend! I will avenge her!
GID00005000	I'll just wait here for Mistress Tabitha.
GID00005001	Ethel, darling! I'll... I'll join you soon again! Someone's gonna pay first, though.
GID00005002	Sounds good to me.
GID00005003	What, you mean like spears? No, none of that. Mom was a tribal, but she didn't teach me anything like that.
GID00005004	You know, like one of the tribes from the East - we got 'em out West, too. NCR's herding 'em up, though, domesticating them.
GID00005005	Mom was from East of the Colorado, though, not sure what tribe. Was before the time Caesar rounded them up, made them Legion.
GID00005006	She walked a hell of a way until she crossed paths with my Dad and he convinced her to stop walking. And lucky for me, he was a horny old bastard.
GID00005007	Not much to tell. He ended up walking East one day when I was young and never came back. Not a family deserter like some, though.
GID00005008	Mom died waiting for him, and she had me to raise. She was sick but she held off dying until I was old enough to be getting into trouble with boys.
GID00005009	As for Dad, I figure he just got himself lost or dead. Happens... and I'm not all boo-hoo about it, so save your glass for someone who's crying.
GID00005010	Not a clue. When he left, I was too in my crib to understand why, and around the time Mom passed, I was too into my teens to listen.
GID00005011	Got his name, got this pendant, and that's about it.
GID00005012	Gift from my Dad, along with my name. Rose of Sharon Cassidy.
GID00005013	Mom said he got the name out of some Old World book about dirt pilgrims. Name sure sounds sweet, though.
GID00005014	Anyway, pendant's a little rose. Originally thought it was one of Mom's tribal necklaces, but no, came from Dad.
GID00005015	Well, keep it away from me, won't have anything to do with it.
GID00005016	My father had heart problems, and it ran down the family tree to me.
GID00005017	Not looking to have my heart skip its last beat, even if I considered putting that junk in my system, which I don't.
GID00005018	Go with you? And why the hell would I do that.
GID00005019	You got one too many by my count.
GID00005020	Meeting Corporal Sterling, well... it kind of got me thinking.
GID00005021	Here's a guy that's been beat all to hell, right? I mean, he could have retired from the service, but instead he signs back on and does what he can.
GID00005022	You think he did the right thing?
GID00005023	Okay, boss. When you feel like availing yourself of my centuries of experience, you know where I'll be.
GID00005024	Sure, boss. I know you've got a lot on your mind, what with all that wandering the empty desert wastes.
GID00005025	You think so, boss? Because I remember a time when a lot of people stuck to their duty no matter what.
GID00005026	It ended with nuclear bombs falling on my hometown.
GID00005027	Even if he can't use them any more? Isn't that like asking you to come up with one of your brilliant schemes after suffering a crippling head wound?
GID00005028	Err, another one, I mean?
GID00005029	That's what I love about you, boss; the pity you show for the less fortunate than you.
GID00005030	You're preaching to the choir here, boss. Once a man's prime is behind him, he should let it go.
GID00005031	I guess it reminds me of my own life.
GID00005032	It's a question I've asked myself often enough.
GID00005033	He reminds me of me in some ways.
GID00005034	Not really, boss, no.
GID00005035	Would it surprise you to know I used to be a gunslinging adventurer?
GID00005036	That Loyal guy. He's getting up there in years, but he still finds a way to make himself useful to his people.
GID00005037	If you ask me, that's better than withering away all alone, or holding on to some faded piece of glory from your past.
GID00005038	Sure, boss. Whenever's good for you - I've probably got three, maybe four months before I keel over.
GID00005039	What do you have in mind?
GID00005040	Hey, who doesn't enjoy a little pinch and squeal every once in a while?
GID00005041	Few children are, especially when they are born during a relatively safe time in our history.
GID00005042	Our children are protected from the outside world, but they are not ignorant of the dangers it holds.
GID00005043	Really, Outsider? I'm open to ideas.
GID00005044	I agree. That is why we do everything we can to teach the children from birth to defend themselves and serve the tribe.
GID00005045	All of us are trained in combat and farming from a very early age. When we reach adulthood, we serve in whatever capacity we are best suited.
GID00005046	Bye.
GID00005047	Thanks.
GID00005048	Thanks.
GID00005049	That's too bad. I was hoping to melt some more down for machining.
GID00005050	Great, that's all I need to get the rebreather to work right. I don't think you'd want to start breathing water halfway down.
GID00005051	If there were any survivors, they're going to be in the Town Hall. If you can get inside, let me know if you find anyone.
GID00005052	Well, if you can help, I'd appreciate it. Need to get these caravans moving.
GID00005053	Oh my fucking god... get away from me, all three... four of you, don't need your...
GID00005054	Oh god, I think I'm going to be sick, and you... you look fine.
GID00005055	Well, guess you're a little tougher than I thought... still, looks like you're feeling it, eh, slick?
GID00005056	You... you all right? You took a little spill there, one moment you're smiling, then...
GID00005057	Still, Jackson's not letting me out of his sight as long as there's still trouble up North.
GID00005058	You settle things with him, help the others around here, too, I'll sign the paper if it means getting out of here.
GID00005059	Walking the Mojave with you can't be any worse than here, that's for sure. All right, I'm in.
GID00005060	Now, onto settle accounts with Gloria Van Graff. Putting her down would suit me just fine.
GID00005061	Might be a little tougher than the Crimson Caravan - Van Graffs are like a nest of rattlers, and the guns they've got are Brotherhood-caliber.
GID00005062	Now, onto settle accounts with Alice McLafferty. Putting her down - that would suit me just fine.
GID00005063	Can't wait to see the look on her face when I show up. She'll know why.
GID00005064	Payback's a bitch, ladies, and between Gloria and Alice, that settles accounts, as far as I'm concerned.
GID00005065	Hope they're in hell right now, blinking, trying to figure out where they fucked up.
GID00005066	My point before? Is that you know the Mojave, and it's a hard place.
GID00005067	They want to buy Cassidy Caravans? Don't they know it's burned to ash?
GID00005068	No... even times being what they are, not sure I'm looking to sell, even for all the whiskey in Reno.
GID00005069	Mojave happened - hit by raiders packing some heavy firepower. Can't believe the Crimson Caravan haven't heard.
GID00005070	So if you want to buy all of Cassidy Caravans, you're looking at it - and what I got in my pockets. Still, as little as that is, not looking to sell.
GID00005071	If someone came up to you and offered you a thousand caps for your name, would you take it?
GID00005072	Actually, you know what, fuck it, I don't want to hear your answer anyway.
GID00005073	Point is, I made the caravan what it is, it's mine.
GID00005074	Alice McLafferty, eh? No, I see the zeroes... and I know she's good for them.
GID00005075	Still, it's not about the money. Dad'd spin like a twister if he ever heard I sold our name for anything.
GID00005076	[SUCCEEDED] You're obviously putting your money where your mouth is - on top of that offer letter, that is a lot of caps.
GID00005077	Still... what makes you think that's enough. What, you think I'm cheap?
GID00005078	[FAILED] "Just a name?" You obviously don't know me at all to sweet talk me like that.
GID00005079	You take your letter, pay my respects to Alice, then kindly go fuck yourself.
GID00005080	[SUCCEEDED] You challenging me? Serious now.
GID00005081	All right, you come here, armed with whiskey, we'll make a sport of it.
GID00005082	And none of that radioactive shit, I'm talking whiskey, not Dixon Whiskey - whiskey.
GID00005083	[FAILED] You are definitely barking up the wrong bar stool. Whatever you're suggesting, not interested.
GID00005084	Old name? What old name?
GID00005085	All right, it's a deal, hand over that paper. Hnh. Can't believe I'm parting with it.
GID00005086	All right... there you go, caravan's yours. Feel kind of relieved, actually. Guess I didn't realize how much I was carrying around with just the name.
GID00005087	So you're telling me, I could take this money you're offering, give them nothing, and then go on to strike up another caravan, same as before?
GID00005088	What kind of fucking negotiator are you? Hope Alice knows the kind of snake she's got working for her.
GID00005089	[SUCCEEDED] What did you just say to me? Cause you sure as hell got my attention now.
GID00005090	[FAILED] Yeah, yeah I will, and you sure as hell aren't taking it. Can't believe I was even listening to you.
GID00005091	Another?!
GID00005092	No... no, I... you got me beat. I'm done, caravan's yours. Give me that paper, I'll... phew... put my name to it.
GID00005093	You want... want to drink more?
GID00005094	<Laughs> All right, all right, you just hang on to the bar here... that's it.
GID00005095	Didn't take you for the toughest courier in the West when you walked in, but you walked all the way to the Outpost, so at least you have guts.
GID00005096	You know you put up a good fight. I'm impressed.
GID00005097	Thing is, I really just wanted an excuse to drink - should last me for a while.
GID00005098	Might just be the whiskey talking, but I think I might feel a whole lot better leaving the caravan business behind me...
GID00005099	Makes me a little teary-eyed, but now I've got a bottle to put 'em in. Hand over that paper, I'll put my name to it.
GID00005100	Awwww. Now ain't that sweet.
GID00005101	Was reminded why I left this place soon as I walked in. Let's go.
GID00005102	Deep? Ain't deep by half. Closed down the bar yesterday, going to close it again today - rinse and repeat.
GID00005103	A sober woman might take insult at that. Me, I might just bust you one.
GID00005104	If you ain't drinking, then leave. If you're making to see if I'm an easy lay, I got a caravan shotgun that'll cure that desire right quick.
GID00005105	"How about a drink?" How about a couple, is what you mean.
GID00005106	Well, let me know when it is.
GID00005107	Hi, I'm Jean-Baptiste, and you're about to stop being a pain in my ass.
GID00005108	That's just fucking great. I knew you didn't have what it takes from the start, but would Glory listen to me? No.
GID00005109	Still, my sister has plans for you, so I'll cut you a break. You bring the girl here, and I'll take care of the fun part. That's fair, eh?
GID00005110	Yeah, if you brought her back here. Is she behind you or something? 'Cause I don't see her.
GID00005111	Now stop stalling, get out there, and do your fucking job already. Sheesh.
GID00005112	You take care now.
GID00005113	Look, I know you came all this way, and that takes some drive, especially these days.
GID00005114	Just doesn't feel right, trading history for a slip of paper.
GID00005115	[SUCCEEDED] That... that's a good point, it's the caravan clearance that's got me stuck here. I'm sure this bar's getting tired of propping me up.
GID00005116	[FAILED] I got a bar, men who don't say a word, and plenty of whiskey, I'm fine.
GID00005117	Me, that's who. I'm not going to let it go just yet. There... there might be some survivors... or...
GID00005118	Who am I kidding. There's nothing left, and I wouldn't be here, drinking in some shitty bar in the ass end of nowhere if it wasn't true.
GID00005119	That's fair. But there's been that voice inside me saying the same thing, and whiskey wasn't killing it.
GID00005120	Give me that paper, I'll put my name to it. No sense trying to hold the past between your fingers when it's nothing but dirt.
GID00005121	Guess that settles that, then.
GID00005122	That's the question I been asking myself.
GID00005123	Take care now.
GID00005124	No idea. Maybe... head back West? Though the idea of heading back there with my tail between my legs isn't appealing.
GID00005125	I'll be waiting, then. And training.
GID00005126	All right then, I already got a head start, but I'll go first anyway.
GID00005127	All right then, I already got a head start, but I'll go first anyway.
GID00005128	Oh, God, I don't know if I can do this.
GID00005129	Hey, the gang's all here! Let's give the Mojave something to remember us by.
GID00005130	I never thought I'd see you again. I'm glad you're here.
GID00005131	Hey, the gang's all here!
GID00005132	Sorry about that. Just because I love them doesn't mean some of them aren't assholes.
GID00005133	Step into my office.
GID00005134	Hey, a dress! Thank you! I'm totally trying this on later.
GID00005135	Aw, you shouldn't have! It's just my taste. Thank you.
GID00005136	See? Just because it doesn't shoot lasers doesn't mean it's not worth looking into. We could do amazing things with this data.
GID00005137	Hey. I, uh, I can't go in with you. I'll wait here, okay?
GID00005138	Huh. Figured it'd have more buttons and dials and stuff, you know? Oh, well. It's still the electronic equivalent of a disease from Gomorrah.
GID00005139	<Gasps> For me? Do you mean it? No, it's too much! Well, okay. But it's too much! It's perfect. Thank you. Thank you.
GID00005140	Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God! Look what they're wearing! I've only seen dresses like those in my dreams. And even then I couldn't afford them.
GID00005141	<Gasps> For me? Do you mean it? No, no, it's too much! Well, okay. But it's too much! It's perfect. Thank you. Thank you.
GID00005142	I... wish I had something to give you. I- wait! What about punching? That's the gift that keeps on giving.
GID00005143	I could work on your punching with you, if you like. Show you how to counter like a Scribe.
GID00005144	All right, put 'em up. Let's see what you got.
GID00005145	You sure? Some other time, then.
GID00005146	Yeah. I've been taking things apart and putting them back together since before I said my first word.
GID00005147	You want to build something, talk to me, and we can do it right there on the spot. Workbenches are for novices.
GID00005148	Who knows, I might even be able to show you a Brotherhood trick or two.
GID00005149	Nowhere specific. I just know there are a lot of groups who're actually doing well for themselves out here.
GID00005150	I want to understand how and why. See them at work.
GID00005151	Don't take too long, all right?
GID00005152	Thanks. Wasn't wild about sticking around here on my own.
GID00005153	I'll send some guys to check out your story, but that's some good news for a change.
GID00005154	Word will probably spread about this, and quickly. The NCR'll know not to come around these parts if they know what's good for 'em.
GID00005155	You've helped us plenty, so I'll tell you what. Just this once, name whatever you want, and if I can make it happen, it's done.
GID00005156	Don't rush it, though. Toss it around in your head a little. You only get one favor from The King.
GID00005157	Sorry about that, friend.
GID00005158	There's a human down the path. Tabitha's orders are to kill all human intruders. Go!
GID00005159	Well, a deputy isn't much good without a sheriff. So I figured I'd come in here and protect these good people until someone finds us a new one.
GID00005160	You must be the courier folks have been talking about. Word on the radio is that someone wronged you back in Goodsprings.
GID00005161	The Mojave has a way of burning decent people up, but it sounds like you've done right by the NCR. It's appreciated. Now what can I do for you?
GID00005162	I know a bit about you, courier. Heard someone messed you up pretty bad over in Goodsprings. I heard a few other things too. Some good, but not all.
GID00005163	If you're going to be associating with rangers, you'd best stay on their friendly side. With that out of the way, what can I do for you?
GID00005164	I'm surprised to see you here. Folks with your kind of reputation, I expect to see them cooking in the sand with some .44 slugs to keep them company.
GID00005165	If the rangers haven't caught up to you yet, they will. Myself excluded, of course. The only thing I catch up on now is chair time.
GID00005166	I don't think we've had the pleasure of meeting before. What can I do for you?
GID00005167	Be seeing you. Maybe.
GID00005168	Good. That'll save us some time.
GID00005169	The training might take several hours, so keep that in mind.
GID00005170	Not sure what my parents would think of me fighting for the NCR.
GID00005171	But for New Vegas it seemed like this was the best chance at stability. I don't regret it.
GID00005172	Never sided with a group of marauders before. But I think the Brotherhood stands a better chance against them than they did against the NCR.
GID00005173	That gives me some hope.
GID00005174	For some reason, it warms my heart that we fought for the kooky old geezer. Guess he reminds me of someone.
GID00005175	Independent New Vegas. If that isn't redundant, I don't know what is.
GID00005176	But I like its chances.
GID00005177	If you take trying to keep me as far away from Hidden Valley as possible because I ask too many difficult questions as a sign of respect, oh yeah.
GID00005178	That's not to say I don't get along with them. I just think they don't know what to do with me sometimes.
GID00005179	It was the Dam, really. We'd heard rumors it was working. Figured we could claim it, put it to use.
GID00005180	And... it may also have been partly that our Elder at the time had worn out his welcome.
GID00005181	Didn't end up mattering. We got sidetracked at HELIOS One and the NCR took the Dam in the meantime. We're still after it, though. In theory.
GID00005182	Ever been nosy?
GID00005183	I was, once. We were pretty young, but I like to think it was love.
GID00005184	She left the Brotherhood. Wanted to put some distance between herself and her parents.
GID00005185	Since our membership isn't open to outsiders, some members think that obligates all of us to procreate.
GID00005186	You can guess which camp her parents belonged to.
GID00005187	No. Couldn't bring myself to leave everyone else behind. Couldn't convince her to stay, either.
GID00005188	I'd hoped love would be enough to influence her decision, but it wasn't. We were both too stubborn.
GID00005189	I don't know where she is now, but I'm sure she's moved on. I still think about her, though. Once in a while.
GID00005190	Ooo. Got any juicy gossip?
GID00005191	Sure.
GID00005192	Who knows? It might stay abandoned, get used as a base for raiders, or even become another colony for mutants.
GID00005193	The future is not written, human, and it is foolish to squint at what cannot be seen.
GID00005194	Be safe, human. And thanks again for everything.
GID00005195	What? No! I thought you were supposed to be here to help, and here you are making accusations.
GID00005196	Yeah, if he vouches for you, I guess I can trust you.
GID00005197	You were just curious. No harm in that. I'm just worried sick about my friend here.
GID00005198	Yeah, the docs say he's going to be laid up for a while, assuming he doesn't get any worse.
GID00005199	[SUCCEEDED] O-Of course not! We're here to serve the good citizens of the NCR. Please, head on through.
GID00005200	[SUCCEEDED] If you're here to see the Major, then I suppose it's all right. Head on through.
GID00005201	[FAILED] Since you put it like that, no. Not unless you know the password. Do you know the password?
GID00005202	That's... that's terrible. I hope the poor little guy gave as good as he got. He always was a fighter.
GID00005203	Why I remember one time when he... do you mind if we talk about something else?
GID00005204	I expect you to treat my Rexie with a little more care. I'm expecting him back now, you hear?
GID00005205	Now, was there something you wanted to talk about?
GID00005206	You're a man of your word, no doubt about it. I can't thank you enough.
GID00005207	If you want, hold onto Rex for a little while longer. I'm sure he'd enjoy that. Was there anything else you wanted?
GID00005208	No no, you can hold onto him for a little while longer, I think. You deserve that much at least, for what you've done.
GID00005209	But aside from the good news about my Rex, was there something you wanted?
GID00005210	Naw, I'm just happy to see my pup back on his feet and happy. I can't thank you enough for this.
GID00005211	Hopefully, he's been making himself useful as a way of paying you back. But where are my manners, did you need something?
GID00005212	What precisely about them did you wish to discuss?
GID00005213	He probably said "lieutenant", Wayne.
GID00005214	The boy means well, but he's dumb as a mutant sometimes.
GID00005215	Sure thing.
GID00005216	Unfortunately for you, I'm not authorized to trade with you. It's against regulations.
GID00005217	I guess I can spare a minute or two for you. Things are a little slow at the moment anyway.
GID00005218	Me? I've been in the military my entire life. It's a family sort of thing. My father served, my brothers serve, and I serve.
GID00005219	I've had the honor of serving all over the NCR and now I get to be out on the front lines as the NCR comes out east to help these folks here.
GID00005220	Once we get rid of the Legion, this will be a better place for everyone, and I'm proud to be a part of that.
GID00005221	I'm on duty here. I don't have time to chit-chat.
GID00005222	I guess I can trust you. What would you like to know?
GID00005223	Sure, what would you like to know?
GID00005224	I'm not required to answer questions from a civilian and I don't trust you enough.
GID00005225	Go bug someone else with your questions.
GID00005226	Well, that is great and all, but it's really against regulations.
GID00005227	I'm not here to make money, I'm here to watch the NCR supplies for the dam and that means no supplies for you.
GID00005228	I guess I can make an exception, just for you.
GID00005229	It's still against regulations, I can't help you.
GID00005230	Make it quick.
GID00005231	The NCR is out here to make the world a better place. For those out here and for all those back home. I'm glad I can be a part of that.
GID00005232	They're a bunch of evil savages if you ask me. We're out here trying to save these good people from being enslaved by those bastards.
GID00005233	I hope we kill 'em all.
GID00005234	Well, the dam here is the key to helping the NCR make the world a better place.
GID00005235	With the power from the dam we can help the people here and back home have a better quality of life.
GID00005236	We can't trust the Legion or Mr. House to do the same. The NCR is the only one looking out for the people. And we need the dam to do that.
GID00005237	And I pity the people that try to take it from us.
GID00005238	Like I'd hang around to find out!
GID00005239	Hey, I can't really move, now. But I'll follow you in spirit.
GID00005240	Gonna be hard covering you when I can't move my legs.
GID00005241	I'm not exactly in Power Armor over here, so why don't you help lighten my load a bit?
GID00005242	[Rex is overburdened and is having difficulty keeping up with you.]
GID00005243	Carrying too much shit to move.
GID00005244	Pinned down here carrying your bags.
GID00005245	I'm not standing here because I'm overburdened with emotion. Take some of this stuff off of me so I can move a little more easily.
GID00005246	Need to lighten my load.
GID00005247	What did you give me, bricks?
GID00005248	Hey, don't worry about it, boss. The decrepit old man can easily carry all your stuff for you. Really.
GID00005249	Didn't your mother ever tell you it's polite to help an old lady carry her bags?
GID00005250	I'm getting... woozy.
GID00005251	Argh. Poison.
GID00005252	Hmm. Might need some antidote here.
GID00005253	Yep. That's poison.
GID00005254	Feel... weak all of a sudden.
GID00005255	Head's spinning - must've got stung.
GID00005256	I need a snakebite kit, fast.
GID00005257	Well. This isn't good. Think I've been poisoned, boss.
GID00005258	That one... had a little kick to it. The poisonous kind of kick.
GID00005259	Boss, I got a poison situation here!
GID00005260	Grandma's feeling woozy - be a dear and fetch her a poison antidote?
GID00005261	Either grandma needs to cut back on grandpa's special moonshine, or she's been poisoned.
GID00005262	MMmmahh. <Smacks lips>
GID00005263	That helps.
GID00005264	Much better.
GID00005265	Sweet as roses.
GID00005266	Getting my second wind here.
GID00005267	Mmm, now that feels good.
GID00005268	Whew.
GID00005269	Ooh, that eases the aches. Not all of them, but some.
GID00005270	Ahh, that feels better. I might not die for a while yet.
GID00005271	Much better.
GID00005272	Oh, grandma feels much better now.
GID00005273	That's much better, isn't it, Leo?
GID00005274	Ahh....
GID00005275	I'm gonna need some new limbs.
GID00005276	I could use a Doctor's Bag if you have any handy.
GID00005277	Need a medic.
GID00005278	Can't feel all my limbs.
GID00005279	Tagged me, need a doctor bag.
GID00005280	Not firing on all pistons here.
GID00005281	A doctor's bag and some whiskey, if you don't mind.
GID00005282	Gonna lose a limb if I don't get some meds.
GID00005283	If I get gangrene before we find a doctor...
GID00005284	Grandma's limbs aren't doing too well, pumpkin.
GID00005285	Yes it hurts, Leo, but the doctors can fix me right up!
GID00005286	That's better. Maybe I should've been a surgeon.
GID00005287	I'm fine now.
GID00005288	Will the medical wonders of the post-apocalyptic world never cease?
GID00005289	Good as new.
GID00005290	Patched up. Let's get back to the fight.
GID00005291	Didn't even leave a scar.
GID00005292	All stitched up.
GID00005293	Prefer a shot of whiskey, but...
GID00005294	That makes me feel young again. No, wait, that's just the Med-X talking.
GID00005295	There. Now my limbs should stay attached a while longer.
GID00005296	That should fix the damage.
GID00005297	Grandma's feeling much better now.
GID00005298	Oh, that's much nicer.
GID00005299	Better than a long hot soak in an oatmeal bath!
GID00005300	Spare some ammo?
GID00005301	All out of ammunition.
GID00005302	If you could spare any ammunition, that would be really terrific.
GID00005303	That's the last of the ammo.
GID00005304	Empty.
GID00005305	Reloading! Wait, no, I'm out!
GID00005306	Trigger's willing, chamber's empty.
GID00005307	No more ammo.
GID00005308	Firing dry here.
GID00005309	I'm out.
GID00005310	I'm all out, boss!
GID00005311	I can throw the gun at 'em if you want, boss.
GID00005312	Could I trouble you for some bullets, boss?
GID00005313	You know those little lead things that fly really fast and hurt people? I need some.
GID00005314	Sweetie, grandma needs some more ammunition!
GID00005315	If I don't get some ammunition soon, Leo's going to start chopping!
GID00005316	Didn't grandma tell you it's good to share, sweetheart? Especially ammo?
GID00005317	Weapon's busted.
GID00005318	Can't use this anymore.
GID00005319	This weapon's done for.
GID00005320	I guess they just don't make 'em like they used to.
GID00005321	Need a new weapon.
GID00005322	This weapon's done.
GID00005323	I'm no good without my weapon.
GID00005324	I need a new rifle.
GID00005325	Gotta spare gun handy?
GID00005326	Weapon's done for.
GID00005327	Piece. Of. Shit.
GID00005328	What a piece of junk!
GID00005329	My weapon broke. Probably my fault.
GID00005330	You got a spare piece, boss, or do I have to break out the tubing?
GID00005331	Leo broke another weapon! I told you you hit too hard, Leo!
GID00005332	Grandma needs another weapon, pumpkin!
GID00005333	Grandma's weapon broke, and there are still backsides that need paddling!
GID00005334	Need a bigger caliber.
GID00005335	Can't punch through.
GID00005336	This is useless.
GID00005337	Might as well be throwing rocks.
GID00005338	Might be time for a weapon upgrade.
GID00005339	Uh... I think I need some more firepower.
GID00005340	You got a bigger gun I can borrow?
GID00005341	I'm not even making a dent with this.
GID00005342	This weapon's on its last legs.
GID00005343	Might as well be shooting blanks!
GID00005344	Maybe I should switch to a squirt gun.
GID00005345	Need something with more kick.
GID00005346	Not even slowing it down!
GID00005347	All I'm doing is pissing him off.
GID00005348	Well, this isn't doing much of anything.
GID00005349	Not sure I'm having any impact here, boss.
GID00005350	Boss, I'm having some... inadequacy issues here. Got a bigger gun I can borrow?
GID00005351	This weapon isn't working! And Leo doesn't like that very much!
GID00005352	Grandma needs a bigger paddle for this behind!
GID00005353	Chop them harder, Leo! Harder! Don't blame the weapon!
GID00005354	Got any armor with less holes in it for me?
GID00005355	I don't have much protection here. Mind helping me out?
GID00005356	What am I wearing? Cardboard?
GID00005357	This armor's gonna get me killed.
GID00005358	Look, I'm dead unless you can get me some real armor.
GID00005359	Shoulda fought naked, it'd hurt less.
GID00005360	Armor's for shit.
GID00005361	They're cutting me up!
GID00005362	Could use sheet metal, not a sheet.
GID00005363	This armor's probably fine. The holes are cosmetic.
GID00005364	This armor's beat up worse than me, boss.
GID00005365	Oof.
GID00005366	Hmm?
GID00005367	It is my medical opinion that that could have gone better.
GID00005368	Thursday! Wait... ugh. Dammit.
GID00005369	What'd I miss?
GID00005370	Huh. Alive after all.
GID00005371	<Sighs> Figures.
GID00005372	Feels like a Brahmin kicked me.
GID00005373	Guess that didn't go so well.
GID00005374	Head's ringing like an alarm clock.
GID00005375	Need a drink.
GID00005376	Better than waking up in jail, I guess.
GID00005377	Am I dead? Is this Heaven? Oh. Hi boss. Guess not.
GID00005378	Oof. Boss, take a look around and see if any of my parts are lying around, huh?
GID00005379	I've woken up worse places. Not many, though.
GID00005380	Gah! Petro-Chico Boy! Petro-Chico Boy is here for my chitlins! Oh. Just a dream. Just a dream....
GID00005381	Is grandma's nap over already?
GID00005382	Grandma's head hurts....
GID00005383	Ouch.
GID00005384	Physician, heal thyself. Guess it's a good thing they invented stims.
GID00005385	Might need to rest soon.
GID00005386	Shot of whiskey might kill the pain.
GID00005387	Wouldn't say no to a Stimpak.
GID00005388	Boss, the pain from my wounds is starting to outweigh the pain from my arthritis.
GID00005389	Little help here, boss?
GID00005390	Wouldn't say no to something to ease the pain. Granted that's usually the case, but right now especially.
GID00005391	Hey boss, is my jaw still attached? Good. Can I get some help to keep it that way?
GID00005392	Oh dear, grandma's not feeling too good!
GID00005393	One two three four five six seven eight nine ten! One two three four five six seven eight nine ten!
GID00005394	Grandma needs her medicine!
GID00005395	Grandma needs to have a little lie down!
GID00005396	<Coughing Fit>
GID00005397	Do me a favor. Make sure they bury me in a nice dress.
GID00005398	I knew I should've been an actress.
GID00005399	Ugh. Maybe I should have stayed back in NCR after all.
GID00005400	I could use a syringe of Med-X or two. Or eight.
GID00005401	So this is how it ends.
GID00005402	Maybe it's my time.
GID00005403	Heh... I knew you'd be the death of me.
GID00005404	Think I might've killed my last legionary.
GID00005405	If I die... take care of my salvage.
GID00005406	It's getting... dark.
GID00005407	I'm not doing so well here.
GID00005408	Too stupid to die... but getting there.
GID00005409	On my last legs here.
GID00005410	If I'm going to die, at least pass me some whiskey.
GID00005411	Got more pain in me than blood.
GID00005412	Ain't beat yet.
GID00005413	Don't let them bury me in Vault City.
GID00005414	Feeling a little worse for wear.
GID00005415	These bones are about to give up the ghost, boss.
GID00005416	Ahh, Rafaela... I'll see you soon.
GID00005417	Never thought I'd go out like this....
GID00005418	No! Grandma won't leave her babies!
GID00005419	Leo, I think we're in very big trouble!
GID00005420	The mission isn't a problem. The problem is with supplies. The convicts are better armed and organized than our intel initially suggested.
GID00005421	I'm trying to get some reinforcements here, maybe some guns with some firepower, but... shit... things are just going slow.
GID00005422	Most people just call it NCRCF. That's NCR Correctional Facility.
GID00005423	A little bit ago the convicts there staged a coup, killed the guards that weren't able to escape, and have been ransacking the area since then.
GID00005424	Not much. They've taken to calling themselves Powder Gangers. Mostly because they've taken to using the explosives meant to clear boulders as weapons.
GID00005425	They got organized faster than I would have thought, most of them at least.
GID00005426	Thankfully the small group in town here seem to have split off from the main force, so they aren't getting anything in the way of support.
GID00005427	Caesar has put a lot of trust in you. Be worth it.
GID00005428	That cowboy robot had us hire six couriers. Each was carrying something a little different. A pair of dice, a chess piece, that kind of stuff.
GID00005429	Last word I had from the office, it looked like payment had been received for the other five jobs. Guess it was just your chip that didn't make it.
GID00005430	First deadbeat we hired to do the job canceled. Hope a storm from the Divide skins him alive. Well, that's where you came in.
GID00005431	To start with, it was a robot that set it up! Came rolling in with a picture of a cowboy on a screen where its face should be.
GID00005432	Had me send a request to the Express office in Hub, for seven couriers to be hired. Each one to carry bric-a-brac, seemed to me!
GID00005433	Playing cards, dice, chess pieces, trinkets like that. Then, next thing I know, he turns around and says he wants six couriers, not seven!
GID00005434	Has me send on the "corrected" order for six couriers along with a bunch of letters and numbers, like some kind of code or something!
GID00005435	Don't ask me what that was about, because I never seen anything like it. Anyways, you must've been Courier 6, then? The Poker Chip?
GID00005436	Well, now that you mention it, a few nights back one of the townies was out scavenging for supplies.
GID00005437	He said he saw a fella with a daisy suit come through with some of them Great Khan misfits. They was talking about a chip.
GID00005438	Name's Raul. Raul Alfonso Tejada. I'm the mechanic around here.
GID00005439	You forget about me already, boss? You sure you didn't take a blow to the head or something?
GID00005440	My name is Raul Alfonso Tejada.
GID00005441	I'm starting to think you haven't been paying attention, boss.
GID00005442	Raul Alfonso Tejada, former gunslinger and sole survivor of Hidalgo Ranch, at your service.
GID00005443	Always happy to repeat myself for you, boss.
GID00005444	Raul Alfonso Tejada, former gunslinger, sole survivor of Hidalgo Ranch, and ghost of Mexico City at your service.
GID00005445	Always happy to repeat myself for you, boss.
GID00005446	Raul Alfonso Tejada, aka Old Miguel, former gunslinger, sole survivor of Hidalgo Ranch, and ghost of Mexico City at your service.
GID00005447	I was born just outside Mexico City. My family had a little ranch there.
GID00005448	I was born just outside Mexico City. My family had a little ranch there. After they died, I took my little sister, my Rafaela, to Mexico City.
GID00005449	We lived there a while, then I moved on and ended up here. I'd rather not talk about it any more.
GID00005450	I was born just outside Mexico City. My family had a little ranch there. After they died, I took my little sister, my Rafaela, to Mexico City.
GID00005451	She died there, so I moved on. I came across an old Petro-Chico refinery, found "Miguel's" jumpsuit, and decided to hang up the guns for good.
GID00005452	I was born just outside Mexico City. My family had a little ranch there. After they died, I took my little sister, my Rafaela, to Mexico City.
GID00005453	She died there, so I moved on. I came across an old Petro-Chico refinery, found "Miguel's" jumpsuit, and decided to hang up the guns for good.
GID00005454	I headed up into Tuscon and lived there as Old Miguel for a while. Things were okay, then they got bad, and I headed west to the Mojave.
GID00005455	And that, boss, is all she wrote.
GID00005456	Old enough to know better, boss. Old enough to know better.
GID00005457	I was born in 2047, boss. If you do the math on that, I'm sure you'll get within a decade or so.
GID00005458	You never heard of Petro-Chico, un Amigo de Poseidon Energy? Ah, of course not. They were an oil company in Mexico, back before the War.
GID00005459	I found it in a costume shop. It was sort of my calling card, you know? "Raul the Ghoul, the zombie vaquero of Mexico City."
GID00005460	Well, boss, when a giant, insane Super mutant asks you to stay put, you do what you're told. Well, maybe you don't, but I'm just a broke down old man.
GID00005461	Probably because it used to be Miguel's.
GID00005462	Boss, usually when somebody gives you a name and nothing else, it's because that's all they want to give you.
GID00005463	Ah, it's stupid, boss. I used to listen to the radio broadcasts, just to pass the time.
GID00005464	Well, one day the signal stops, so I figured I'd try to find transmitter. I'm a pretty good repairman, or I was before the eyes started to go.
GID00005465	Anyway, I found Black Mountain and offered my services, but Tabitha decided I was useful enough to keep around. Permanently.
GID00005466	I'm not much use besides being a portable encyclopedia, really. I guess you could use me as a pack brahmin, but my knees aren't so good any more.
GID00005467	I'm still half-decent with a pistol. Not fantastic, but good enough. These old bones aren't much use in hand-to-hand fighting, though.
GID00005468	I can keep your gear in good working order, too. If you notice your stuff takes a lot longer to break, well, you can thank me with a sarsaparilla.
GID00005469	Felt good to put the old vaquero outfit on again. I feel a lot sharper with a pistol now. Still wouldn't put these old bones on the front lines.
GID00005470	I can also do maintenance work on your stuff - I don't have the supplies for a real repair job, but I can keep your gear working longer.
GID00005471	That's nice of you to say, boss, but I'm an old man. Not much use to anybody any more.
GID00005472	Time was, I was a pretty good shot with a pistol. I guess I'm still half-decent. These old bones aren't much use in hand-to-hand fighting, though.
GID00005473	I can also do maintenance work on your stuff - I don't have the supplies for a real repair job, but I can keep your gear working longer.
GID00005474	I sort of figured you had your own reasons for keeping me around, boss.
GID00005475	I don't have the supplies for a real repair job, but I can do some routine maintenance to keep your gear working longer.
GID00005476	It won't exactly get better, but it'll get worse slower.
GID00005477	I'm an open book, boss. Granted, the book's in Spanish and some of the pages have fallen out, but I'm an open book.
GID00005478	Though Arcade's intentions were pure and his goals were noble, he ultimately succumbed to the harsh brutality of the Mojave like so many before him.
GID00005479	Tricked by the Courier and imprisoned by the Legion, Arcade remained Caesar's personal physician for several years.
GID00005480	Caesar grew fond of speaking with such an educated man on philosophical matters. Arcade became his unwilling intellectual sparring partner.
GID00005481	After years of such servitude, during an unguarded moment, Arcade used a surgical scalpel and his bare hands to disembowel himself.
GID00005482	Lacking any other skilled medical personnel, the Legion was unable to prevent his death. Caesar mourned his loss for months.
GID00005483	Though the Legion was victorious at Hoover Dam, the Legate did not have the same medical needs as Caesar.
GID00005484	Lanius quickly tired of Arcade's acerbic wit and had the doctor crucified.
GID00005485	During the retreat of Caesar's Legion from the Mojave Wasteland, Arcade was a sad casualty, one of many.
GID00005486	His body was heaped with those of many others in a nameless ravine on the Legion's long march home.
GID00005487	Though Arcade had not hoped for an NCR victory, he was proud of his role in the defense of Hoover Dam against the forces of Caesar's Legion.
GID00005488	Unfortunately, when word spread that Arcade was once a member of the Enclave, he was forced out of the Followers of the Apocalypse.
GID00005489	Pursued by bounty hunters, NCR rangers, and the Brotherhood of Steel, Arcade pushed deep into the eastern plains and was never heard from again.
GID00005490	Arcade had hoped that Freeside would be able to remain independent of NCR rule, but he was glad that Caesar's Legion had been stopped at Hoover Dam.
GID00005491	He tended to the sick in Freeside for a while longer, then returned to NCR territory to become a teacher with the Followers there.
GID00005492	Though Arcade was crushed by the Legion's victory at Hoover Dam, he was not among NCR's casualties.
GID00005493	During the NCR's retreat from the Mojave Wasteland, he helped defend NCR citizens and refugees on their way to Mojave Outpost.
GID00005494	Unfortunately, NCR rangers identified his father's armor as Enclave property. He was arrested, tried as a war criminal, and imprisoned indefinitely.
GID00005495	When news reached Freeside that Legion forces were approaching New Vegas, Arcade did his best to help people escape with adequate supplies.
GID00005496	A Legion explorer saw Arcade helping locals escape and pointed him out to a Centurion.
GID00005497	Arcade's group was run down somewhere near Westside. There were no survivors.
GID00005498	Arcade was outraged by Mr. House's power play following the defeat of Caesar's Legion at Hoover Dam.
GID00005499	Though he remained in Freeside for a short time after the Securitrons established widespread control, he eventually traveled back into NCR territory.
GID00005500	Disillusioned with the Followers of the Apocalypse, he settled down in the outskirts of the Boneyard, where he worked happily as a family doctor.
GID00005501	Arcade was proud to have been one of the defenders who helped repel the Legion from Hoover Dam.
GID00005502	He was prouder still to see the area freed from the shackles of the NCR and Mr. House.
GID00005503	Though independence for New Vegas was not all he hoped it could be, Arcade used his Enclave knowledge and technology to keep order wherever he could.
GID00005504	Arcade was tending to the locals of Freeside when he learned that Caesar's Legion had been defeated and NCR was being pushed out of New Vegas.
GID00005505	Though he found that independence for New Vegas was not all he hoped it would be, Arcade did his best to help the locals govern themselves.
GID00005506	Though Arcade was proud to have been one of the defenders who turned back the Legion at Hoover Dam, he was crushed by Mr. House's ascent to power.
GID00005507	Saddened by the loss of life and liberty in the area, Arcade left the Mojave Wasteland for parts unknown. He was never heard from again.
GID00005508	Though some Super Mutants and Nightkin continued to journey to the legendary Utobitha, they found little trace of its existence.
GID00005509	Some eventually found their way to Jacobstown, but many wandered off into the wastes, confused and disheartened.
GID00005510	Tabitha and Rhonda went east, through Caesar's land. Occasionally tales of their exploits found their way back west, though few believed them.
GID00005511	Eventually the stories concerning the duo were collected and published, and proved to be quite popular with children.
GID00005512	Black Mountain Radio continued to broadcast its peculiar form of propaganda. Raul Tejada faced his execution each day, though pardoned in the end.
GID00005513	Travelers venturing too near Black Mountain continue to be harassed by Tabitha's followers.
GID00005514	Tabitha, enraged by Raul's escape, took the remaining Nightkin of Black Mountain with her and vanished without a trace.
GID00005515	Travelers in the region soon learned to avoid the roads at night, as caravans were repeatedly attacked by unseen assailants.
GID00005516	Without organized leadership, the remaining Boomers slowly drifted away, leaving Nellis Air Force Base to be flooded by prospectors and scavengers.
GID00005517	All of the Boomers' accumulated knowledge quickly scattered, and their existence slowly faded from memory.
GID00005518	After the battle of Hoover Dam, the NCR mounted several campaigns against the Boomers, but all were quickly ended by the Boomers' artillery.
GID00005519	Over time, as the Boomers found a need for gun powder, they developed a relationship with the Gun Runners, trading their surplus crops for munitions.
GID00005520	Mr. House showed little interest in the Boomers and left them to themselves in Nellis.
GID00005521	The tribe remained fortified in Nellis with their backs to the world.
GID00005522	The Boomers defended themselves against many attacks from the Legion, but they eventually fell to the Legion's superior numbers.
GID00005523	The Legion enslaved the Boomers and erased any memory of their existence from the wasteland.
GID00005524	With little law left in the wasteland, the Boomers continued to defend themselves against the prospectors and scavengers invading their territory.
GID00005525	With the help of the Gun Runners, the Boomers developed a healthy trading relationship with the NCR.
GID00005526	Eventually the Boomers began wandering out into the wasteland, while still preventing outsiders from entering Nellis.
GID00005527	Mr. House showed little interest on the Boomers, who eventually began venturing out of Nellis to meet and trade with travelers.
GID00005528	Cautious after the Boomers' display of power at Hoover Dam, Caesar chose to leave the Boomers alone.
GID00005529	The Boomers remained isolated but have been seen flying over the Mojave Desert from time to time.
GID00005530	Though the Wasteland became anarchic after Hoover Dam, the Boomers' display of power dissuaded fortune seekers from attempting to penetrate Nellis.
GID00005531	Tired of waiting for the world to be done with him, Boone ventured into the wastes to make his own way out.
GID00005532	Unable to clear his mind of the past, he was at last granted the death he'd awaited, bringing final rest to a life that had ended long ago.
GID00005533	As the Battle of Hoover Dam ended, Boone confirmed what he had always suspected - that revenge would never quiet his troubled mind.
GID00005534	Side arm in hand, he journeyed back to California in search of the NCR officer who had led the attack on Bitter Springs.
GID00005535	There, with only two bullets loaded, Boone did the only thing he believed would put an end to his suffering.
GID00005536	Looking for a place where he could be of some use, Boone found himself re-enlisting with his old unit.
GID00005537	Though his regrets remained in his thoughts, they coalesced into a purpose, and Boone embraced it.
GID00005538	He spent his leave time hunting down slavers in the desert, his First Recon beret the last thing they never saw.
GID00005539	Though NCR was withdrawing from the region, Boone remained in New Vegas, finding work as a security guard and caravan scout along the highways.
GID00005540	While he might've preferred rejoining his old unit, Boone couldn't bring himself to abandon the city where he'd met his wife.
GID00005541	Boone refused to take the Legion's victory lying down.
GID00005542	Heading to the hills with his rifle, he began a deadly campaign against high-ranking Legion officers.
GID00005543	And though the price on his head rose to levels unheard of, few pursued it, fearing it would be the last thing they'd never see.
GID00005544	No longer held in check by his conscience, Boone found lucrative work as a mercenary and assassin.
GID00005545	No job was too violent, no target too innocent. As long as the caps were good, Boone would take the job.
GID00005546	Driven mad by Caesar's victory at Hoover Dam, and unable to escape his memories, Boone staged a suicide mission against the Legate.
GID00005547	Fighting as he wished he would've fought on the day of his wife's death, he brought down scores of Legionaries before being caught.
GID00005548	Before his crucifixion, he was brought before the Legate, who expressed his admiration for Boone's reckless abandon.
GID00005549	Boone spat tobacco in his eye, for all of Caesar's armies to see.
GID00005550	Buried beneath tons of rubble, the Mojave chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel was no more.
GID00005551	Those few who were outside the Hidden Valley bunker when it was destroyed settled into new lives, or headed west to find a new chapter to join.
GID00005552	During the fight for Hoover Dam, the Brotherhood took HELIOS One, inflicting heavy damage on retreating NCR forces, but it was a pyrrhic victory.
GID00005553	Once The Strip was secured, Caesar's forces overwhelmed and eventually routed the Brotherhood from HELIOS One and Hidden Valley.
GID00005554	The Brotherhood used the battle of Hoover Dam as an opportunity to retake HELIOS One, and came to control the area between it and Hidden Valley.
GID00005555	With no organized opposition, their patrols began monitoring trade along I-15 and 95, seizing any items of technology they deemed inappropriate.
GID00005556	The Brotherhood and the NCR in the Mojave Wasteland declared an official truce, despite continued hostilities between the two in the west.
GID00005557	As per their agreement, the NCR handed over all suits of salvaged power armor and in return the Brotherhood helped patrol I-15 and Highway 95.
GID00005558	Due to their temporary truce, the Brotherhood allowed the NCR to retreat from the Mojave Wasteland without incident.
GID00005559	In the relative peace that followed, Brotherhood patrols appeared along major roads, harassing travelers over any bits of technology they had.
GID00005560	Rose of Sharon Cassidy died as her caravan died - in an unmarked grave, another victim of the Mojave.
GID00005561	Despite the destruction of Cassidy Caravans, Cass lived for 30 more years.
GID00005562	She made her way back West and passed away in a small shack outside of Vault City, the rose pendant still around her neck.
GID00005563	The slaughter of the Van Graffs and the Crimson Caravan caused no end of trouble for NCR back West.
GID00005564	Already struggling, NCR's supply lines suffered further as the two caravans withdrew support until the "massacre in the East" was resolved.
GID00005565	In the years following the destruction of Cassidy Caravans, NCR used evidence of the plot to blackmail the Crimson Caravan and the Van Graffs.
GID00005566	NCR enacted strict trade laws with little resistance, strengthening their supply lines and their position in the Mojave.
GID00005567	Cass survived to see the NCR flag flying proud over Hoover Dam, and thought for a moment... this is what a hero must feel like.
GID00005568	Cass lived to see Hoover Dam in its Old World glory, humming with power the likes of which the Mojave had never seen.
GID00005569	Vegas burned brighter than ever, Securitrons filled the streets, and Cass's heart skipped... just a little.
GID00005570	Her last words were to the Dam - and to herself. "We were going full speed ahead... but facing backwards the whole time."
GID00005571	Cass lived to see the Courier bring down three armies and by her count, that was three more than she'd expected. She'd kept quiet about that, though.
GID00005572	Cass lived to see the mark of the Legion on Hoover Dam. Uncertain of what lay next for the West, she remained silent.
GID00005573	As the Legion marched West, she found it difficult to see the Dam as anything more than a gravestone for the Mojave - and everyone in it.
GID00005574	Caesar entered The Strip as though it was his Triumph. The Legion pushed the NCR out of New Vegas entirely, driving them back to the Mojave Outpost.
GID00005575	The Legion occupied all major locations, enslaving much of the population and peacefully lording over the rest.
GID00005576	Under the Legion's banner, civilization - unforgiving as it was - finally came to the Mojave wasteland.
GID00005577	The Legate is crowned as the new Caesar. He entered The Strip as though it was a military target, destroying anyone who resisted him.
GID00005578	The Legion brutally occupied all major locations, killing and enslaving a large amount of the population.
GID00005579	Under the Legion's banner, civilization - savage as it was - finally came to the Mojave wasteland.
GID00005580	And so the Courier's road came to an end... for now.
GID00005581	In the new world of the Mojave wasteland, fighting continued, blood was spilled, and many lived and died - just as they had in the Old World.
GID00005582	Because war... war never changes.
GID00005583	The Courier, fair and even-handed in his dealings throughout the Wasteland, was honored by the NCR for his support of the military at Hoover Dam.
GID00005584	He was presented with the Golden Branch, the highest civilian decoration given by the republic.
GID00005585	Though the Courier's agenda was debated by many, he was honored by NCR for his support of the military at Hoover Dam.
GID00005586	He was presented with the Golden Branch, the highest civilian decoration given by the Republic.
GID00005587	With brutal methods that few in NCR would approve of, it was the Courier who secured NCR's victory at Hoover Dam.
GID00005588	Despite his extreme actions, he was awarded with the Golden Branch, the highest civilian decoration given by the Republic.
GID00005589	Though the Courier himself was just and forthright in his dealings throughout the Wasteland, he helped the Legion achieve victory.
GID00005590	Caesar honored him with a golden coin, minted in celebration of his contributions and distributed throughout the wasteland.
GID00005591	The Courier, a mercenary at heart, helped the Legion achieve victory at Hoover Dam.
GID00005592	Caesar honored him with a golden coin, minted in celebration of his contributions and distributed throughout the wasteland.
GID00005593	The Legion marched over the Hoover Dam with the help of one who was as brutal and merciless as the worst of them: The Courier.
GID00005594	Caesar honored him with a golden coin, minted in celebration of his contributions and distributed throughout the wasteland.
GID00005595	The Courier, fair and kind-hearted to those in the Wasteland, ensured that Mr. House would keep New Vegas stable and secure for future generations.
GID00005596	Mr. House afforded him every luxury at his disposal in the Lucky 38, out of gratitude - and a quiet sense of pride for his choice in lieutenants.
GID00005597	The Courier, who had a mixed history in the Wasteland, kept the status quo at Hoover Dam.
GID00005598	Mr. House would keep New Vegas stable, if not free, for generations. Mr. House afforded the Courier every luxury at his disposal in the Lucky 38.
GID00005599	The Courier, cruel and merciless, had ensured that Mr. House would maintain complete control over New Vegas and everyone in it.
GID00005600	Mr. House afforded him every luxury at his disposal in the Lucky 38, partly out of gratitude, and party out of fear.
GID00005601	Supporting the ideals of independence, the Courier was recognized as the man responsible for a truly free New Vegas.
GID00005602	He ensured Mr. House's tyranny was broken and neither Caesar's Legion nor NCR would ever gain control over New Vegas.
GID00005603	Preferring neither the best of the NCR nor the worst of the Legion, the Courier was the man responsible for a truly independent New Vegas.
GID00005604	He had removed Mr. House from power over the Strip and broken the influence of the NCR and Caesar's Legion in the Mojave Wasteland.
GID00005605	Supporting all the chaos that comes with independence, the Courier was the man responsible for a truly free New Vegas.
GID00005606	He ensured the fall of Mr. House and the end of the Legion's and NCR's influence over New Vegas.
GID00005607	After a long and fantastic journey, ED-E finally met its end with the dangers of the Mojave.
GID00005608	It lay destroyed and gathering dust, waiting for scavengers to pick through its remains for salvage.
GID00005609	ED-E remained forgotten in the shop of Johnson Nash, until it was repaired by another courier who let it continue on its journey to Navarro.
GID00005610	ED-E was eventually discovered by the Followers of the Apocalypse who managed to recover vast databanks of scientific knowledge.
GID00005611	ED-E traveled with the Courier until one of its memory banks was triggered causing it to continue its travels on to Navarro.
GID00005612	Upon reaching Navarro ED-E vanished and was not see in the wastes again.
GID00005613	With its logs cleared and its systems upgraded ED-E remained a vigilant and constant companion to the courier.
GID00005614	The Followers of the Apocalypse used the information recovered from ED-E on Poseidon Energy, to develop new methods to harness the energy of the sun.
GID00005615	With its logs cleared and its systems upgraded ED-E remained a vigilant and constant companion to the courier.
GID00005616	The Brotherhood used the information recovered from ED-E to create a small army of Duraframe Eyebots.
GID00005617	With its logs cleared and its systems upgraded ED-E is discovered by a traveling caravan, who take him on as a protector as they wander the wastes.
GID00005618	The Followers of the Apocalypse used the information recovered from ED-E on Poseidon Energy, to develop new methods to harness the energy of the sun.
GID00005619	With its logs cleared and its systems upgraded ED-E is discovered by a traveling caravan, who take him on as a protector as they wander the wastes.
GID00005620	The Brotherhood used the information recovered from ED-E to create a small army of Duraframe Eyebots.
GID00005621	Their leaders destroyed by the Courier, the Fiends scattered throughout the wasteland.
GID00005622	Without the organization of Motor-Runner, Cook-Cook, Violet, and Driver Nephi, they were easy prey.
GID00005623	Never weakened by NCR, the Fiends staged an attack against Camp McCarran during the second Battle of Hoover Dam.
GID00005624	Though NCR repulsed the Fiends, they suffered heavy losses in the process.
GID00005625	The Fiends staged an attack against Camp McCarran during the second Battle of Hoover Dam.
GID00005626	During the NCR's retreat, the Fiends overwhelmed many of the troopers before Mr. House's Securitrons could deal with them.
GID00005627	The Fiends overran Camp McCarran during the second Battle of Hoover Dam.
GID00005628	In the anarchic months that followed, the Fiends asserted dominance over Outer Vegas.
GID00005629	Though weakened, the Fiends attacked McCarran during the second Battle of Hoover Dam.
GID00005630	NCR repulsed the attack with minimal losses and, in the following days, destroyed the remaining Fiend leaders, breaking their power forever.
GID00005631	The Fiends attacked Camp McCarran during the second Battle of Hoover Dam and suffered heavy losses.
GID00005632	Caesar, unimpressed with their performance and their dependence on chems, had them exterminated.
GID00005633	The Fiends attacked Camp McCarran during the second Battle of Hoover Dam, but the NCR repulsed the attack with minimal losses.
GID00005634	When Mr. House asserted control over Outer Vegas, his Securitrons eradicated the remaining Fiends entirely.
GID00005635	The Fiends attacked Camp McCarran during the second Battle of Hoover Dam and, despite suffering heavy losses, overran it.
GID00005636	They continued to be a nuisance throughout Outer Vegas, but never established full control over the area.
GID00005637	With no clear leader to guide efforts in Freeside, the Followers of the Apocalypse lost control of Old Mormon Fort to local thugs and junkies.
GID00005638	Eventually, using the Followers' remaining supplies to manufacture drugs, the Old Mormon Fort quickly devolved into little more than a junkie den.
GID00005639	After the NCR's victory at the dam, the Followers of the Apocalypse were pushed out of Old Mormon Fort during its occupation by NCR forces.
GID00005640	NCR further "encouraged" them to leave Outer Vegas entirely, and the Followers had no choice but to comply.
GID00005641	After the NCR's victory at the dam, in part thanks to Follower medical support, NCR allowed the Followers to care for refugees as they see fit.
GID00005642	Old Mormon Fort expanded its services and was able to aid more people, becoming a refuge for the less fortunate citizens of New Vegas.
GID00005643	After the Legion's victory, the new Caesar learned the Followers had "defamed" the original Caesar's noble origins.
GID00005644	The Followers of the Apocalypse were hunted down and exterminated, and Old Mormon Fort was turned into a pile of rubble.
GID00005645	After the Legion's victory, Caesar, out of a strange respect for his old fellows, allowed the Followers safe passage out of the wasteland.
GID00005646	Reluctantly, the Followers accepted the offer and abandoned Old Mormon Fort to the Legion.
GID00005647	After the Courier ensured New Vegas remain free, the Followers found that independent Vegas was even more unstable and violent than before.
GID00005648	Old Mormon Fort became excessively burdened by the influx of patients, struggling to provide even the most basic of services.
GID00005649	Travelers continued to stop by Goodsprings Source for water on the Long 15, but rarely would anyone venture into the ruins of Goodsprings itself.
GID00005650	Those who did were almost always tourists, come to visit the graveyard where the Courier "rose from the dead."
GID00005651	Goodsprings saw more trade along I-15 after NCR gained control of the Mojave Wasteland, but with that came a heavy burden of the Republic's taxes.
GID00005652	Some old-timers, unable to handle the cost, were forced to move on, grumbling all the while.
GID00005653	The Legion, preoccupied with its acquisition of New Vegas, scarcely took notice of the town of Goodsprings.
GID00005654	Many locals moved on, fearful of Caesar's long shadow. Only the old and the stubborn remained.
GID00005655	After Mr. House gained control of New Vegas, he sent a Securitron to Goodsprings as a token of appreciation for helping the Courier.
GID00005656	Victor was a mixed blessing, however, as he continually monitored the town for Mr. House.
GID00005657	With New Vegas' independence formally declared, Goodsprings thrived.
GID00005658	More travelers stopped by Goodsprings on their way to and from the Strip, and the locals grew prosperous from the traffic.
GID00005659	After generations of being beaten down, the Great Khans were finally broken by the Courier.
GID00005660	Those few who avoided the Courier's wrath moved north, into the wilderness of Idaho, where they tried once more to rebuild.
GID00005661	After the Second Battle of Hoover Dam, the Great Khans returned for a time to Red Rock Canyon.
GID00005662	The NCR's pressing need to expand proved greater than its promise of amnesty, and before long the government decided the Khans had to go.
GID00005663	The surviving Great Khans were relocated to an isolated, barren reservation, well north of NCR trade routes.
GID00005664	For supporting the NCR, the Great Khans were ruthlessly hunted down by the victorious Legion.
GID00005665	Caesar destroyed all evidence of their existence at Red Rock Canyon, and forbade mention of their name in any history.
GID00005666	The Great Khans' legacy was swiftly forgotten.
GID00005667	As reward for their loyal service, Caesar forcibly integrated the Great Khans into the Legion.
GID00005668	The sick and elderly were killed, the women sold as wives to ranking officers, and the tribe's identity was annihilated.
GID00005669	Though many Great Khans mourned the death of their tribe, many more were ultimately satisfied with their revenge against NCR.
GID00005670	After driving the Legion out of the Mojave Wasteland, the victorious NCR turned its attention to those who had allied themselves with Caesar.
GID00005671	The Great Khans were among the first tribes to suffer this fate, and the few who survived Hoover Dam were driven north, into the wilderness of Idaho.
GID00005672	During the Battle of Hoover Dam, the Great Khans quickly evacuated Red Rock Canyon and headed north and east into the plains of Wyoming.
GID00005673	There, they reconnected with the Followers of the Apocalypse and rebuilt their strength.
GID00005674	Bolstered by ancient knowledge of governance, economics, and transportation, they carved a mighty empire out of the ruins of the Northwest.
GID00005675	After their suicidal last stand at Hoover Dam, the Great Khans ceased to exist as a tribe.
GID00005676	The few surviving members dispersed, joining up with other tribes and gangs across the Mojave, and quickly forgot their heritage.
GID00005677	The Courier, with the aid of Yes Man, drove both the Legion and the NCR from Hoover Dam, securing New Vegas' independence from both factions.
GID00005678	With Mr. House out of the picture, the remaining Securitrons on The Strip were hard-pressed to keep order. Anarchy ruled the streets.
GID00005679	When the fires died, New Vegas remained, assuming its position as an independent power in the Mojave.
GID00005680	The Courier, with the aid of Yes Man, drove both the Legion and the NCR from Hoover Dam, securing New Vegas' independence from both factions.
GID00005681	With Mr. House out of the picture, part of the Securitron army was diverted to the Strip to keep order. Any chaos on the streets was ended, quickly.
GID00005682	Chaos became uncertainty, then acceptance, with minimal loss of life. New Vegas assumed its position as an independent power in the Mojave.
GID00005683	And so the Courier who had cheated death in the cemetery outside Goodsprings cheated death once again, and the Mojave wasteland was forever changed.
GID00005684	With Jacobstown's leadership destroyed, the remaining Super Mutants and Nightkin of the west scattered across the wasteland.
GID00005685	Jacobstown withered away, its death going unnoticed by the rest of the Mojave.
GID00005686	Thanks to the Courier and Lily, a cure for the Nightkin schizophrenia was found shortly after Doctor Henry's experiment concluded.
GID00005687	Nightkin and other Super Mutants in the wasteland flocked to Jacobstown, and the town became known as a haven where a mutant could find peace.
GID00005688	Though a cure for the Nightkin schizophrenia was eventually found, it became a case of too little, too late for Jacobstown.
GID00005689	Disgruntled by the death of their leader, Keene, most of the Nightkin scattered into the wasteland, their insanity worsening with each day.
GID00005690	Jacobstown, constantly on guard for anti-mutant reprisals, never truly prospered.
GID00005691	Though a cure for the Nightkin schizophrenia was eventually found, it became a case of too little, too late for Jacobstown.
GID00005692	Most Nightkin at Jacobstown followed their leader Keene out into the wasteland, terrorizing the Mojave for years to come.
GID00005693	Jacobstown, constantly on guard for anti-mutant reprisals, never truly prospered.
GID00005694	It took more time than anticipated for a cure for the Nightkin schizophrenia to be found, but in the end it was beneficial to Jacobstown.
GID00005695	The presence of the Nightkin leader, Keene, persuaded Nightkin from across the wasteland to make the journey to the town.
GID00005696	Jacobstown prospered, becoming known as a fair - if somewhat intimidating - place for a trader to do business.
GID00005697	With no cure for the Nightkin schizophrenia in sight, the disgruntled Nightkin left Jacobstown. Without a treatment, their insanity grew.
GID00005698	The crazed Nightkin terrorized the wasteland, and Jacobstown suffered repeated reprisals from mutant-hating humans.
GID00005699	In the end, the surviving mutants abandoned Jacobstown entirely, its existence quickly forgotten by the rest of the wasteland.
GID00005700	With the King dead and most of their gang slain by the Courier, the remaining Kings fled the area, never to be heard from again.
GID00005701	After the NCR victory at Hoover Dam, the temporary truce between them and the Kings blossomed into a full-scale relief effort for the people.
GID00005702	While the NCR made repeated entreaties that Freeside join the Republic, the Kings steadfastly maintained their independence.
GID00005703	Accusing the Kings of lying with a foreign invader for their newfound ties to the NCR, Mr. House punished them by ordering their forced removal.
GID00005704	The Kings, defiant to the end, were destroyed to the last man by House's Securitrons.
GID00005705	Following the Second Battle of Hoover Dam, Freeside came to be known as one of the more stable areas in the region.
GID00005706	Ironically, NCR refugees found Freeside safer than most of the rest of New Vegas, where resentment still lingers.
GID00005707	After their victory at Hoover Dam, the Legion quickly set about destroying all remaining resistance, including any groups with ties to the NCR.
GID00005708	Upon discovering the Kings' newfound relationship with the NCR, Legionaires flooded the streets of Freeside, and the Kings were quickly destroyed.
GID00005709	While the NCR was busy fighting the Legion at Hoover Dam, some Kings took it upon themselves to attack NCR citizens and soldiers around Freeside.
GID00005710	When the NCR moved to secure the region, they cracked down the hardest on Freeside, sending a full platoon to sweep the neighborhood.
GID00005711	Most of the Kings were killed, with the few survivors driven out into the wastes.
GID00005712	During the Second Battle of Hoover Dam, some Kings took it upon themselves to launch several attacks on NCR citizens and soldiers around Freeside.
GID00005713	Mr. House looked on these actions favorably, seeing them as proof of the Kings' loyalty to New Vegas, and decided to leave them alone.
GID00005714	In the aftermath of the Second Battle of Hoover Dam, the Kings took the opportunity to viciously force all NCR citizens out of Freeside.
GID00005715	Travelers from the Republic quickly learned to avoid Freeside if they valued their safety.
GID00005716	Impressed with the Kings' continued attacks upon NCR citizens and soldiers, the Legion offered them the option of being assimilated into the Legion.
GID00005717	The Kings refused, and briefly became slaves in the Legion, but after failed escape attempt, they were all put to death.
GID00005718	As the NCR moved to secure the region, the occupation of Freeside proved especially problematic.
GID00005719	Things remained tense due to numerous incidents, though the Kings were still in nominal control of the area.
GID00005720	Flush with his victory, Mr. House sent Securitrons into Freeside, thinking to increase his control over the area.
GID00005721	When fighting broke out, the Kings fought valiantly, but were no match for the armored killing machines, and were wiped out to the last man.
GID00005722	The Kings retained their control of Freeside, and while they continued to favor the needs of locals, they tolerated the citizens of the defeated NCR.
GID00005723	After their victory at Hoover Dam, Legion troops rolled through Freeside.
GID00005724	The Kings tried to fight back, but most were killed, and the rest fled into the wasteland.
GID00005725	Lily's long life finally came to a close in the Mojave Wasteland. As the life faded from her, her last thoughts were of her grandchildren.
GID00005726	Encouraged by the Courier to take her medication regularly, Lily's mind eventually attained a semblance of clarity.
GID00005727	Her memories dulled by the pills, she cast aside the recording of her grandchildren, no longer remembering its significance.
GID00005728	Lily continued to take her medicine at half-doses, and although she remembered her grandchildren, her mind remained muddled and confused.
GID00005729	Eventually, she parted ways with the Courier and traveled west, seeking the remnants of her past.
GID00005730	Encouraged by the Courier to stop taking her medication altogether, Lily's instabilities grew worse with each passing day.
GID00005731	Eventually she became little more than a ravening beast, the kindly old grandmother subsumed beneath the rage.
GID00005732	Slain to the last man by the Courier, the Misfits were at least spared the humiliation of dying during Caesar's attack on Camp Golf.
GID00005733	Few mourned their absence.
GID00005734	Shaped up by the Courier's advice, the Misfits distinguished themselves during the Legion's attack on Camp Golf.
GID00005735	Mags was finally promoted to Sergeant, and the rest of the Misfits received an official commendation.
GID00005736	They continued to serve with distinction for many years.
GID00005737	Though Camp Golf fell to Caesar, the Misfits distinguished themselves during the Legion's attack.
GID00005738	Mags and her soldiers were posthumously recognized for their valor by NCR.
GID00005739	The Misfits' laziness caught up with them when the Legion attacked Camp Golf.
GID00005740	Those who weren't killed in the attack attempted to flee, but were caught at Mojave Outpost, court-martialed, and hanged from the ranger monument.
GID00005741	Driven into a frenzy by their use of Psycho, the Misfits inflicted heavy casualties on the Legion during the defense of Camp Golf.
GID00005742	At first they were commended for their valor, but eventually, desperate for more of the chem, they turned on travelers in Outer Vegas.
GID00005743	For their dishonorable conduct, the NCR court-martialed and executed them by firing squad.
GID00005744	Mr. House's Securitron army took control of Hoover Dam and The Strip, pushing both the Legion and the exhausted NCR out of New Vegas.
GID00005745	Mr. House continued to run New Vegas his way, a despotic vision of Pre-War glory. The streets were orderly, efficient, cold.
GID00005746	New Vegas continued to be the sole place in the wasteland where fortunes were won and lost in the blink of an eye.
GID00005747	The New California Republic celebrated its second victory at Hoover Dam, establishing definitive control over the entire Mojave Wasteland.
GID00005748	Soon after, they negotiated terms to annex The Strip, Freeside, and many surrounding communities.
GID00005749	The Mojave wasteland, at long last, had entirely fallen under the NCR's banner.
GID00005750	Despite their vigilance against potential attacks by the Legion, the citizens of Novac were no match for the Courier.
GID00005751	The motel and Dinky the Dinosaur were left vacant, a rare stop at best for travelers along Highway 95.
GID00005752	Though Novac was a low-priority target for the Legion, many of Novac's citizens died in its defense.
GID00005753	In the weeks that followed, feral ghouls, overflowing from the REPCONN Test Site, ravaged the weakened town.
GID00005754	Though Novac was a low-priority target for the Legion, many of Novac's citizens died in its defense.
GID00005755	With no other communities coming to its defense, Novac would eventually fall to the Legion's persistent attacks.
GID00005756	Though Novac was a low-priority target for the Legion, many of Novac's citizens died in its defense.
GID00005757	In the weeks that followed, several Bright Followers returned to Novac to help restore its defenses, allowing it to remain independent of NCR.
GID00005758	During the Legion's attack on Novac, Bright Followers, returning from their long pilgrimage, assisted in its evacuation.
GID00005759	Though Novac eventually fell to the Legion, many citizens of Novac were able to escape, alive and intact.
GID00005760	While the destruction of the REPCONN rockets appeared to be a boon to the salvagers of Novac, the benefit would never be realized.
GID00005761	Radioactive fuel from the wrecked ships seeped out and contaminated the area. Salvagers were forced to move on, and the town was abandoned.
GID00005762	With Cooke dead, the Powder Gangers at Vault 19 fell apart.
GID00005763	Those who weren't destroyed by the Courier fled into the hills or attempted to work their way back through the Mojave Wasteland. Few survived.
GID00005764	Armed with a wide array of improvised explosives and stolen weapons, the Vault 19 Powder Gang tormented the Mojave Wasteland for years.
GID00005765	Citizens of the NCR were favorite targets, and they always suffered the worst fates.
GID00005766	After the Vault 19 Powder Gang surrendered to the NCR, they were re-incorporated into the correctional system.
GID00005767	The NCR did increase their sentences, as they aren't about to take off time for good behavior.
GID00005768	After the majority of the Vault 19 Powder Gangers joined the Great Khans, the weaker members scattered throughout the Mojave Wasteland.
GID00005769	Though a few managed to erase their pasts, most never survived the journey.
GID00005770	Primm, already torn apart by Powder Gangers, was dealt a killing blow by the Courier.
GID00005771	Though prospectors pick through the remains of the town from time to time, no one re-establishes it as a settlement.
GID00005772	After Hoover Dam, NCR helps rebuild Primm as a major stopping point on the Long 15.
GID00005773	Though Primm's citizens chafe under NCR's taxes, they benefit greatly from the increased protection and merchant traffic.
GID00005774	Despite NCR's pledge to support Primm, they abandon the town after their loss to Mr. House.
GID00005775	As repayment for their NCR loyalty, Mr. House sends Securitrons to Primm to "protect" it and collect heavy taxes from its citizens.
GID00005776	Despite NCR's pledge to support Primm, they abandon the town after their loss to Caesar.
GID00005777	Though Caesar keeps Primm open for business, its citizens live under the constant watch of Legion soldiers.
GID00005778	Despite NCR's pledge to support Primm, they abandon the town after their loss to the Courier.
GID00005779	Independent again, Primm operates much as it had before the Powder Gangs arrived: full of ups and downs.
GID00005780	After Hoover Dam, Sheriff Meyers runs Primm with his own style of frontier justice.
GID00005781	He deals with most folks fairly, but now and then someone winds up dead with little to no evidence against them.
GID00005782	Hot-headed to the end, Sheriff Meyers choose to oppose Caesar's takeover of Primm with a standoff.
GID00005783	Though the citizens take out a few Legionaries, the town quickly falls to Caesar, its citizens utterly wiped out.
GID00005784	Primm Slim proves to be an able-minded, if not able-bodied, sheriff for Primm.
GID00005785	Due to his slow speed, some crooks get away without a scratch, but Primm continues to prosper under his watchful robotic eye.
GID00005786	Not understanding the gravity of the Legion's imminent takeover of Primm, Sheriff Primm Slim valiantly attempts to resist Caesar's will.
GID00005787	After the death of Chief Hanlon, the power of NCR's Rangers was broken for years.
GID00005788	Their organization, so reliant on the wisdom and guidance of its elder members, became a shadow of what it once was to people across the wasteland.
GID00005789	Defying Chief Hanlon's worst fears, NCR's rangers persevered and distinguished themselves during the second Battle of Hoover Dam.
GID00005790	The rangers, along with NCR's many troopers, shared the glory of victory.
GID00005791	Hanlon wisely stayed out of the spotlight, crediting General Oliver's leadership for NCR's success.
GID00005792	After a brief fanfare, Hanlon stepped down as chief and returned to the peace and quiet of his ranch outside of Redding.
GID00005793	During the attack on Hoover Dam, Chief Hanlon and his rangers threw themselves into the path of the Legion assault, dying to the last man and woman.
GID00005794	In the aftermath that followed in the NCR, bitter citizens and opportunistic senators were quick to denounce President Kimball and General Oliver.
GID00005795	Hanlon and his fallen rangers were revered for their bravery and sacrifice.
GID00005796	Despite distinguishing themselves during the second Battle of Hoover Dam, the rangers' victory was short-lived due to the Courier's interference.
GID00005797	Chief Hanlon personally directed the evacuation of the rangers to Mojave Outpost as they fell back into NCR territory.
GID00005798	Bitter over the waste of life in the Mojave, Hanlon stepped down from his post.
GID00005799	After a campaign in which he denounced Oliver's and Kimball's hawkish, imperialist ways, Hanlon was elected as the senator of Redding.
GID00005800	Although they performed admirably during NCR's defense of Hoover Dam, the rangers fell into decline soon after.
GID00005801	With Hanlon's plot against the occupation exposed and Oliver hailed as NCR's new war hero, many rangers were greeted coldly on their return home.
GID00005802	Few openly blamed the rangers for Hanlon's treachery, but public and political support for the organization quickly dwindled.
GID00005803	With Caesar's victory came a small measure of vindication for the rangers' late Chief Hanlon.
GID00005804	Upon the military's return, debate raged within NCR's senate about who was to blame for the loss of Hoover Dam.
GID00005805	Though some in NCR regarded Hanlon as a traitor, many believed he was the only military commander who saw the futility in defending New Vegas.
GID00005806	Although they performed admirably during NCR's defense of Hoover Dam, the rangers fell into decline soon after.
GID00005807	With Hanlon's plot against the occupation exposed and Oliver denounced for losing Hoover Dam, many rangers were greeted coldly on their return home.
GID00005808	Few openly blamed the rangers for Hanlon's treachery, but public and political support for the military as a whole quickly dwindled.
GID00005809	Due to the Courier's intervention, Chief Hanlon abandoned his plan to sabotage the defense of Hoover Dam.
GID00005810	The rangers assisted the troopers admirably during the Legion's ill-fated attack.
GID00005811	Though General Oliver and Chief Hanlon were both praised for their leadership, the chief quietly stepped out of the spotlight.
GID00005812	After a brief fanfare for a life full of accomplishments, Chief Hanlon retired and returned to the peace and quiet of his ranch in Redding.
GID00005813	Due to the Courier's intervention, Chief Hanlon abandoned his plan to sabotage the defense of Hoover Dam.
GID00005814	The rangers heroically assisted NCR's troopers in their ill-fated defense against the overwhelming power of Caesar's Legion.
GID00005815	Though many NCR military officers fled the territory soon after the dam was lost, Chief Hanlon remained at Camp Golf to surrender to the Legion.
GID00005816	Out of respect for Hanlon's composure and worth as an adversary, Caesar had him beheaded.
GID00005817	Due to the Courier's intervention, Chief Hanlon abandoned his plan to sabotage the defense of Hoover Dam.
GID00005818	The rangers heroically assisted NCR's troopers in their ill-fated defense against the overwhelming power of Caesar's Legion.
GID00005819	Though many NCR military officers fled the territory soon after the dam was lost, Chief Hanlon remained at Camp Golf to surrender to the Legion.
GID00005820	Despite the late Caesar's respect for Chief Hanlon as an adversary, Legate Lanius had Hanlon crucified along with all of the other rangers.
GID00005821	Due to the Courier's intervention, Chief Hanlon abandoned his plan to sabotage the defense of Hoover Dam.
GID00005822	The rangers assisted the troopers admirably during the Legion's ill-fated attack.
GID00005823	Though the Courier snatched victory from NCR, only General Oliver was blamed for the loss of Hoover Dam.
GID00005824	Hanlon, exhausted after a lifetime of service to the NCR, stepped down from his position in the rangers and retired to his ranch in Redding.
GID00005825	After a long and eventful life, Raul's luck finally ran out during his time with the Courier.
GID00005826	Still grappling with self-doubt over his usefulness in the face of old age, Raul was never able to find peace with himself.
GID00005827	Eventually, he left the Mojave and assumed a new name, as he had done so many times before.
GID00005828	Invigorated by his travels with the Courier, Raul once more took up his guns in memory of his lost Rafaela.
GID00005829	Soon after, the Mojave was filled with tales of the ghost-vaquero who hunts down those who prey on the weak.
GID00005830	Convinced that his time as a gunslinger was past, Raul made peace with the idea of growing old.
GID00005831	After traveling with the Courier for a time, he retired and settled down in Outer Vegas, where he would spend his days fixing ancient machinery.
GID00005832	Despite surviving the destruction of the oil rig and the loss of their comrades at Navarro, the venerable Remnants were no match for the Courier.
GID00005833	They carried the secrets of their old lives to their graves.
GID00005834	After their bold arrival at Hoover Dam, the Remnants disappeared as quickly as they came.
GID00005835	Legends of their power spread throughout the southwest, a reminder of why people once feared the sight of vertibirds in the sky.
GID00005836	Merciless in their assault on the NCR, the Remnants struck fear into the hearts of even the Centurions at Hoover Dam.
GID00005837	Well aware of the full extent of their power, Caesar commanded his troops to not pursue them.
GID00005838	Merciless in their assault on the NCR, the Remnants struck fear into the hearts of even the Centurions at Hoover Dam.
GID00005839	Caesar's heirs aggressively pursued the Remnants into Arizona, losing hundreds of Legionaries in the process and gaining nothing in return.
GID00005840	He had survived police service in Colorado, the Great War, combat duty with the Legion, and being the companion of The King.
GID00005841	But, in the end, Rex finally succumbed to the horrors of the wasteland.
GID00005842	Having never received a replacement brain, Rex finally succumbed to old age, abruptly shutting down forever one quiet morning.
GID00005843	After two centuries of life and decades of service to humanity, Rex collapses and dies.
GID00005844	Revitalized by Violetta's brain, Rex eventually learned to balance the memories of his old life with Violetta's experiences among the brutal Fiends.
GID00005845	His mind had difficulty adjusting, but Rex eventually found peace with his new, more vicious self.
GID00005846	With the transplant of Lupa's brain, Rex gained all of the donor's experiences traveling with the Legion.
GID00005847	These melded well with his own memories of the Legion, and his new mind quickly adjusted to the myriad memories.
GID00005848	After Rey's brain was transplanted into Rex's cybernetic body, it took Rex some time to adjust to the old scrap yard dog's memories.
GID00005849	Eventually, Rex's mind settled peacefully, melding his own memories with that of long travels with Old Lady Gibson.
GID00005850	At odds with leadership over the Brotherhood's future, Veronica looked to the Mojave Wasteland for an answer both she and they could live with.
GID00005851	But the answer would never come, and the dangers of the world that had left the Brotherhood of Steel behind would eventually claim her life.
GID00005852	Hoping to lead the Mojave Brotherhood down a new path, Veronica sought to learn from the thriving cultures of the desert.
GID00005853	Absent a firm solution, Veronica's expression of frustration with Brotherhood leadership would lead to her banishment.
GID00005854	She ended her days a wandering tinker.
GID00005855	Despite her departure from the group, the Brotherhood's peace treaty with NCR came as some relief to Veronica.
GID00005856	Though she remained friendly with surface patrols, she was never again permitted to enter the bunker she once called home.
GID00005857	Fearing for the safety of anyone she associated with, she continued her solitary life as a scavenger.
GID00005858	But reports would emerge from Mojave scientists and social workers of old equipment miraculously repaired and research notes mysteriously completed.
GID00005859	Though she'd seen the writing on the wall, the destruction of the Mojave Brotherhood came far more suddenly than Veronica had expected.
GID00005860	The news devastated her. Despite her best efforts to leave her past behind, she found herself compelled to make one final journey to Hidden Valley.
GID00005861	There, she paid her last respects to the only family she had ever known.
GID00005862	The Brotherhood's open aggression along the New Vegas highways troubled Veronica greatly.
GID00005863	Nevertheless, it removed all doubt from her mind that in leaving them she had made the right choice.
GID00005864	Eventually she would take to the road, less in hopes of finding a new home than of leaving memories of the old one behind her.
GID00005865	The peace with NCR served to ease Veronica's worries about the Brotherhood's immediate future.
GID00005866	Still, a distance had arisen between her and her fellow members that would never be bridged.
GID00005867	She began secluding herself in crumbling libraries of the Old World, learning of promising technologies she knew the Brotherhood would never adopt.
GID00005868	The death of the Mojave Brotherhood came much too soon for Veronica, and in their absence, she felt truly lost.
GID00005869	Yet in its wake, she took small comfort in her decision to remain by their side through their few remaining days.
GID00005870	Veronica put her moral sensibilities aside and supported the Brotherhood's new campaign of aggression as best she could.
GID00005871	Yet deep down, she understood that it meant their end would surely be soon to follow.
GID00005872	If you say so. I already got paid, after all.
GID00005873	I'm glad that you understand. After you.
GID00005874	You're either brave or crazy. Either way, I don't care.
GID00005875	You'll probably be able to think of a few more before you leave, trust me.
GID00005876	If you're sure, then I guess I'll take my leave. You know where to find me.
GID00005877	Of course.
GID00005878	Now you're talking. Here's how it works, I'll keep nearby for the duration of your stay here, and no one messes with you.
GID00005879	As soon as you split Freeside, I'm off. Nothin' too complicated. That said, lead the way, chief.
GID00005880	That's a shame. Well, come back when you do.
GID00005881	Freeside's a rough and tumble place, but it also belongs to the Kings. You have one of us with you, and everyone else'll give you a wide berth.
GID00005882	Makes the stroll a bit more leisurely.
GID00005883	That's what they all say. At first.
GID00005884	Cocky, aren't you? Oh well, your call.
GID00005885	Nothing while I'm on the clock. You wanna know about us, head on over to our place. It's the one with the big sign that says "The Kings".
GID00005886	You need anything else?
GID00005887	Lead, and I shall follow.
GID00005888	Great. As long as you're in Freeside, I'll be hanging out by side. It'll be a blast.
GID00005889	But I'm only sticking around as long as you're in Freeside. You leave, and you'll find me gone as well.
GID00005890	So where to?
GID00005891	Then I guess you're on your own.
GID00005892	Freeside's a little dangerous for people traveling alone or in small groups. You go without a guard, you're rolling the dice, you know?
GID00005893	You must be new. Your tune'll change, trust me.
GID00005894	Suit yourself.
GID00005895	Whatever you say.
GID00005896	Nothing. I'm working right now. You want to know more, head over to our hangout at the center of town. It's kinda hard to miss.
GID00005897	Did you want something else?
GID00005898	You want the best, you have to be prepared to pay for it.
GID00005899	I can give you something to bite down on if you want. This'll hurt.
GID00005900	Can't help you, then. Medical supplies aren't cheap, you know.
GID00005901	If you say so.
GID00005902	This shouldn't be too much work. Try to sit still.
GID00005903	Can't help you, then. Medical supplies aren't cheap, you know.
GID00005904	Not a problem. Just some scrapes here and there.
GID00005905	Can't help you, then. Medical supplies aren't cheap, you know.
GID00005906	Ordinarily I'd take your word on that, but lately I've had several people lie and claim to be citizens just to take advantage of our program.
GID00005907	But I've come up with a fairly simple way to tell who's lying. You up to taking a little test?
GID00005908	In that case, I'm sorry. Our program is only for citizens of the NCR.
GID00005909	[SUCCEEDED] You don't look like you're from around here, so I guess I can believe that.
GID00005910	Just head to the northwest part of town, by the old train station. We start handing out supplies at six every night.
GID00005911	There'll be some guards by the door, but just remember that the password is "Hope," and they'll let you by right quick.
GID00005912	[FAILED] I'd like to believe you, but I can't take the risk under current circumstances.
GID00005913	Please, don't let me keep you if you have somewhere else to be.
GID00005914	This'll just take a few moments, and it's all stuff that any real citizen of the NCR knows.
GID00005915	Okay, first question. Who was the most popular president in NCR history, Kimball, Tibbett, Tandi, or Peterson?
GID00005916	Sorry to have bothered you, then.
GID00005917	Interesting. Okay, next question - what was the original name of the NCR capital - The Boneyard, Shady Sands, Aradesh, or Vault 13?
GID00005918	Interesting. Okay, next question - what was the original name of the NCR capital - The Boneyard, Shady Sands, Aradesh, or Vault 13?
GID00005919	Fair enough. All right, last question - What animal is on the NCR's flag - a two-headed bear, an eagle, a two-headed snake, or a two-tailed lion?
GID00005920	Fair enough. All right, last question - What animal is on the NCR's flag - a two-headed bear, an eagle, a two-headed snake, or a two-tailed lion?
GID00005921	Very good! I'm happy to say you've proven you're definitely an NCR citizen, which means you qualify for our program.
GID00005922	Just head to the northwest part of town, by the old train station. We start handing out supplies at six every night.
GID00005923	There'll be some guards by the door, but just remember that the password is "Hope," and they'll let you by right quick.
GID00005924	I'm sorry, but you didn't get all of the questions right, which proves you're not a citizen of the NCR. Sorry.
GID00005925	I'm sorry, but you didn't get all of the questions right, which proves you're not a citizen of the NCR. Sorry.
GID00005926	I probably shouldn't let you, but I suppose everyone has an bad day now and then. Did you want to take it now?
GID00005927	They should. I guess it's possible that some don't, but this stuff is pretty common knowledge.
GID00005928	Tell you what, come back later and you can take the test again, okay?
GID00005929	Okay, here we go again. Who was the most popular president in NCR history, Kimball, Tibbett, Tandi, or Peterson?
GID00005930	That's fine. I'll let you take the test again whenever you choose to come back.
GID00005931	Hey, wait up a moment. I can tell you're really upset that you didn't pass the test, so I'll let you take it again any time you want to come back.
GID00005932	It'll be my good deed for the day. Take care now.
GID00005933	Now, it's not that I don't believe you, but I'm going to have to give you a little quiz to verify your citizenship status. That okay with you?
GID00005934	Then I'm afraid I have nothing to offer you, sorry.
GID00005935	That's a good attitude! I'm sure you'll do fine. These are just a few questions that just about anyone in the NCR would know.
GID00005936	All right, here we go. First question. Who was the most popular president in NCR history - Peterson, Tibbett, Kimball, or Tandi?
GID00005937	You can always take it later. Stop back anytime.
GID00005938	Uh huh. Okay, second question - what was the original name of the NCR capital - Aradesh, Shady Sands, The Boneyard, or Vault 13?
GID00005939	Uh huh. Okay, second question - what was the original name of the NCR capital - Aradesh, Shady Sands, The Boneyard, or Vault 13?
GID00005940	Right. Fine then, last question - What animal is on the NCR's flag - a two-headed bear, an eagle, a two-headed snake, or a two-tailed lion?
GID00005941	Right. Fine then, last question - What animal is on the NCR's flag - a two-headed bear, an eagle, a two-headed snake, or a two-tailed lion?
GID00005942	Good. You passed with flying colors. I told you it'd be fine. I expect you're wanting to know about that meal then, huh?
GID00005943	We're located up by the old train station, in the northwest part of town. Just tell the guards "Hope" and they'll let you through.
GID00005944	Best of luck to you.
GID00005945	Ooh, I'm sorry. It looks like you've got some of your facts mixed up. I'm afraid I can't help you.
GID00005946	Ooh, I'm sorry. It looks like you've got some of your facts mixed up. I'm afraid I can't help you.
GID00005947	I'm not really supposed to administer the test more than once, but what the hell? You're the only new face I've seen today.
GID00005948	Did you want to take it again right away?
GID00005949	All right, here we go. First question - who was the most popular president in NCR history, Peterson, Tibbett, Kimball, or Tandi?
GID00005950	Just stop by and we'll go over it again.
GID00005951	I'm sure some don't, but the loyal ones do. And that's who we're aiming to help - the loyal ones.
GID00005952	Still, you've got a fire in you that tells me you're one of us and just screwed up, so I'll let you take the test again if you'd like.
GID00005953	[SUCCEEDED] Now I know you're from the NCR! None of the vagrants around here would even think of giving their money away.
GID00005954	We're located up by the old train station, in the northwest part of town. Just tell the guards "Hope" and they'll let you through.
GID00005955	Best of luck to you.
GID00005956	[FAILED] Look, we're trying to help people here. Put away your money.
GID00005957	No need to get angry about this. Look, I'll let you take the test again if you want. Go and clear your mind and come back, and we'll try again.
GID00005958	In that case, don't mind me. Carry on.
GID00005959	Wha-? Oh, shit. I heard of you. Look, we didn't mean nothing by this. Just following orders. You want us gone, we're gone - no problem.
GID00005960	Eesh, boss, are you trying to destroy my knees even faster than nature?
GID00005961	Oh, wearing this is not going to be good to me.
GID00005962	How'd you know I had a sweet tooth, boss?
GID00005963	Ahh, sarsaparilla. That's just what this dry old throat needs.
GID00005964	You're going to rot my teeth, boss. What's left of them, anyways.
GID00005965	What do you think of guys like Ranger Andy?
GID00005966	Sure, boss. I'm sure you've got a lot to think about.
GID00005967	Yeah, okay, boss. Take your time. Not like I'm a decrepit old man who might keel over dead any minute.
GID00005968	I mean guys who have a world of experience doing what they do, but have to give it up because they're getting old and slow, or too injured.
GID00005969	That wasn't what I meant, really.
GID00005970	Maybe... yeah. I guess you've got a point there.
GID00005971	Yeah, I suppose you're right. Guys like us can't compete any more.
GID00005972	Did I say us? I meant "him." Guess my eyesight isn't the only thing that's going.
GID00005973	Yeah, I suppose he could still teach, take a less-active role in the world. That's not so bad.
GID00005974	Maybe, but what if he really doesn't have it?
GID00005975	A little of both, I guess.

GID00005993	<pant pant pant>
GID00005994	[The paint, though weathered and fading, is still a recent addition to Rex's bodywork.]
GID00005995	<pant pant pant>
GID00005996	[Rex's new brain looks fresh and healthy.]
GID00005997	[Rex's brain looks sickly, and the gel in which it's contained doesn't look much better.]
GID00005998	[Rex's bodywork is battered, scorched, and scratched. It's remarkable that the biological part of him survived at all.]
GID00005999	I don't know. Last time anyone saw him was in the battle at HELIOS One. I wasn't there.
GID00006000	He gave orders to hold the plant until it could be reactivated. But he ran out of time. The NCR overran it. Everyone thought he was dead.
GID00006001	But I got a note from him at a comm station. That's... how he liked to talk, even to me. He wasn't good at face-to-face.
GID00006002	Yeah. I miss him.
GID00006003	Elijah could look at an old device and immediately understand what made it work. And he could see its potential. Where it fit with other technology.
GID00006004	It's not something you can teach, but he tried with me. Some of it stuck.
GID00006005	But that's what he taught me. You asked what I learned from him.
GID00006006	Okay.
GID00006007	I learned what I don't want to become.
GID00006008	In the end, there was just him and his vision. Nothing and no one else.
GID00006009	It was... strange. Even for Father Elijah. He's always been unstable, but this was... something else.
GID00006010	I don't want to say delusional, but I don't know what else to call it. The only thing familiar about it was the signature.
GID00006011	He said the Brotherhood was doomed, but that he'd return, save us. But the way he said it... I don't know...
GID00006012	Said he'd return with one of the greatest treasures of the Old World, make the Mojave like it was meant to be... wipe the slate clean.
GID00006013	It was by his request, actually. He cleared it with the other Elders. Somehow.
GID00006014	They sent him to look into the Dam. There was a time when I'd have begged to follow. Watch him at work.
GID00006015	He did. For years, he fought with the Council. Taught me to question our direction. Meanwhile he'd become more out-of-touch than all of them.
GID00006016	On our way East he demanded we stop at HELIOS One to examine it. While we were there, we received word that the NCR had taken the Dam.
GID00006017	He was furious. Called it "children playing with a bomb." But he was mad because we'd lost its power. What we'd use it for... he didn't even care.
GID00006018	Yeah, I did. I couldn't help him.
GID00006019	He just didn't listen. And the idea that people talked back to him...
GID00006020	If he could have made the Brotherhood act like machines, ordering them around with a push of a button, he would have.
GID00006021	They're cautious. When they discover something, they respect it, learn its limits, consider how to preserve it. Used to drive Father Elijah crazy.
GID00006022	He liked to learn limits, too, but only so he could push them.
GID00006023	That's not to excuse the other Elders, though. They all covet technology for its own sake. Some are just more fanatical than others.
GID00006024	You take care of our problems here and I'll give you the information that you need.
GID00006025	Them Powder Gangsters got our deputy locked up in the Bison Steve. Be nice to get him out of there... but this town's gonna need some real law.
GID00006026	One of the first things them punks did when they came in was to kill our sheriff. You find us a new one and we can talk.
GID00006027	I'll be there, but it won't mean squat if the rest of the group isn't there, too.
GID00006028	I hope you weren't thinking we were going to take the lead. That's no job for a bunch of graybeards. Or grayheads, in Whitman's case.
GID00006029	I'll be there at the reunion. Let's hope the others show up, too, or this plan isn't going to work.
GID00006030	Yeah, well, don't count on us sticking around if things get too hot. We're not a suicide squad. I'll go to this reunion.
GID00006031	You haven't decided - well, this is just getting better every second, isn't it?
GID00006032	I wouldn't mind cutting down a few platoons of NCR troopers with my old gatling laser.
GID00006033	Yeah, it does. There's not a chance you'll find me helping the NCR in any way. They've caused me too much grief.
GID00006034	Oh, I'll come, but depending on the plan, I might not be staying. Keep that in mind.
GID00006035	All right, then - I'll show up at this gathering of yours. It might be good to see the others - Johnson excluded.
GID00006036	Arcade might've mentioned there's a pass phrase needed to get into the bunker - my part is "Remember."
GID00006037	Little escapes the notice of Caesar's Legion. We know a great deal about the Vegas Strip, and the comings and goings of those who frequent it.
GID00006038	Unlike most of my brothers and sisters, Mama didn't get sick of my father and get rid of him. He died right before I was born.
GID00006039	Mama had liked him so much, she made me use his last name. Said he deserved that much at least, since he never got to meet me or nothin'.
GID00006040	Got a second to talk, boss?
GID00006041	That's a good thing to see, huh boss?
GID00006042	Questions, boss? You mean you don't know everything there is to know already?
GID00006043	Hey boss, can I ask you something?
GID00006044	Sure, boss. What do you want to know?
GID00006045	That's what I love about you, boss, your firm belief that one day you'll actually remember things people tell you. What do you want to hear about?
GID00006046	I grew up in a place called Hidalgo Ranch just outside Mexico City. It wasn't much, just a bit of farm with a house for three generations of Tejadas.
GID00006047	I wasn't the best-behaved kid. I was quick with my hands, with a pistol or a wrench, and I wasn't afraid to get into fights over it.
GID00006048	I never killed anybody, but I had my share of run-ins with the police. Mostly my family kept me in line.
GID00006049	This was before the war. We were far enough away from Mexico City when the bombs fell that we missed the worst of it - but things got bad quick.
GID00006050	After the fire, I knew my sister and I couldn't stay at Hidalgo Ranch anymore. The refugees still wanted me dead - they even put a bounty on me.
GID00006051	I remember how scared Rafaela was. I told her if she came with me, we'd see the vaqueros - she used to love the rodeo, especially the trick riders.
GID00006052	We figured maybe we could find help in Mexico City - we were young, we didn't know what had happened, really. We didn't understand about the bombs.
GID00006053	I left everything when I left Mexico: my home, my family, my name - even my face. I know it's surprising, boss, but I wasn't always this handsome.
GID00006054	As far as the world knew, I was Miguel, and I was okay with that. I headed north for a while, and ended up in Tuscon - not Two-Sun, by the way.
GID00006055	Things were good there. Well, maybe not good, but better than Mexico City, anyways. I found myself a little shack and started fixing things.
GID00006056	Just how old do you think I am, boss? Because I can pretty much guarantee I'm older than that. Let me tell you a story from before the Great War:
GID00006057	Everybody knew Robert House. He was a genius. A superstar. Founded RobCo at 22, dated Hollywood starlets, the works. They say he saved Las Vegas.
GID00006058	I was in Mexico City when the bombs dropped. Even from there, we could see House's defensive rockets shooting down the incoming missiles.
GID00006059	Everybody assumed he died in the War. Maybe he did. But his robots are still out there, roaming the Wastes. And now, a Mr. House rules New Vegas.
GID00006060	Sure, boss. I saw lots of guys like that while I was held prisoner by an insane supermutant in an isolated mountain fortress. Can you narrow it down?
GID00006061	Benny, huh? Sorry boss, doesn't ring a bell. Then again, my brain isn't as sharp as it used to be.
GID00006062	They're all right, I suppose. Had a bit of tough going there at the beginning - you know their first town was nearly wiped out by raiders?
GID00006063	Anyway, they've got their good points and their bad, just like a lot of the old governments from before the War.
GID00006064	I don't really have a problem with them. People around here tend to see them as invading marauders planning to burn and pillage the countryside.
GID00006065	But I've been to Arizona, boss. Before the Legion, it was a nasty place, so thick with raiders you couldn't trade with a town two miles up the road.
GID00006066	Caesar's laws aren't nice, and their actions aren't always pretty. But then, neither am I, but you keep me around.
GID00006067	It's big, it's bright, and it's one of the biggest cities still left from before the War. Well, mostly, anyway.
GID00006068	Used to be just a curiosity. The buildings were pre-War, but it was just as full of raiders and barbarian tribes as anyplace else.
GID00006069	Then Mr. House took over, got the power turned back on, and got the tribes reformed into something civilized. Now they run his casinos for him.
GID00006070	You're a veritable guyser of curiosity, boss.
GID00006071	Anything to hold your attention, boss.
GID00006072	Anything you say, boss.
GID00006073	Just a little bit, boss. No, I haven't seen him. Sounds like a city slicker, though. Might try looking on the Strip.
GID00006074	You know what, boss, that's my fault for using sarcasm. No, I haven't seen him. Sounds like a city slicker, though. Might try looking on the Strip.
GID00006075	Maybe not. Maybe the new guy is just a clever raider chief with a knowledge of history.
GID00006076	Maybe he just left instructions for his robots to carry out in his name.
GID00006077	Or maybe Robert House uploaded his brain pattern into a computer and rules to this day, a godless, soulless machine-god!
GID00006078	Or maybe the whole thing's a crazy coincidence. Who knows?
GID00006079	I remember there were some weird stories about him, especially near the end.
GID00006080	There was a tell-all in El Periodico de las Aburridas by a starlet House dated. She said they never, um... don't make me spell it out, boss.
GID00006081	Anyway, she said all he wanted to do was scan her brain and make her dress up in different outfits.
GID00006082	It was quite the scandal, at least in the Latin-American tabloid journalism market.
GID00006083	Since Johnson won't be needing his Power Armor, I've decided to let you have it. You'll need training in how to use it, so talk to Moreno about it.
GID00006084	I've known them far longer than you have. They'll get over it.
GID00006085	I'd like a large Atomic Shake and a double Brahmin burger. And easy on the agave sauce this time.
GID00006086	We gave you a password, Veronica. It's for your safety.
GID00006087	I know where you live Ramos. Open up.
GID00006088	<Sighs> For Pete's sake. Opening up. Welcome back, Veronica.
GID00006089	Hold on, I've got this.
GID00006090	Not much to tell. Benny had one of Mr. House's Securitrons, deactivated, and wanted it switched back on.
GID00006091	He had heard I was interested in Mr. House's technology so he hit me up... so to speak.
GID00006092	I take it you're speaking from experience.
GID00006093	You're right though. He's gone now, so I'm not going to let it bother me anymore. Thanks.
GID00006094	That's sweet of you to say, even if it isn't true.
GID00006095	Good point.
GID00006096	And maybe you should go jump off Hoover Dam, jackass.
GID00006097	Not exactly sure... radio's been on the fritz, and since I haven't heard any shooting, I don't think it's urgent. Can't hurt to go ask her.
GID00006098	I disagree. You're the one who wanted our help in the first place. You want us to succeed, you go talk to Moreno.
GID00006099	You've got only one chance at this. I know Moreno - once he's made up his mind about something, there's no changing it.
GID00006100	You guys are actually going to help the Legion? No thanks - count me out of this one.
GID00006101	Well, anyway, Judah's given Orion's armor to you now. It'll take a few hours for me to show you how to use it properly, so let's get started.
GID00006102	Yeah, he did.
GID00006103	Right. Moving on, then.
GID00006104	No, I'm done talking.
GID00006105	Let's see what you've got.
GID00006106	Sign says you go south... just look for the rollercoaster. Oh and don't go north, a caravan just got sacked up the road.
GID00006107	Just a hunter, out here killing things and hoping their hides fetch more than the bullets cost to kill 'em.
GID00006108	Watch your back out there.
GID00006109	Whatever.
GID00006110	Keep your guns loaded and ready.
GID00006111	I could use some Stimpaks... how 'bout some nice Bloatfly Steaks in trade?
GID00006112	That's a dangerous question... asked the way a bandit might ask... but since we're close to town I'll trust your good intentions.
GID00006113	It just gets worse the further north you go... Deathclaws... death in general. But it's your ass, I suppose.
GID00006114	Here you go.
GID00006115	Just let me know if you decide you want something.
GID00006116	Okay, so take the Brotherhood. Replace their knowledge of superweapons with half as much knowledge of medicine and farming.
GID00006117	Sprinkle in a little compassion for people outside their group and healthy disrespect for authority, and voila. Followers.
GID00006118	I never really considered joining before. But now that I think about it, it really sounds like it could be a good fit, doesn't it?
GID00006119	I want... a dress.
GID00006120	I would say he was my tutor, but that doesn't cover it.
GID00006121	After my parents passed, he looked after me. The whole Brotherhood brought me up, really, but he made sure of it.
GID00006122	I never had a grandfather - not that I knew, anyway - but Elijah was in some ways what I'd imagine a grandfather to be.
GID00006123	Just my parents, but they haven't been around for a long time. Dad was a Paladin, Mom was a Scribe.
GID00006124	They died in the same battle trying to hold off the NCR from... something. I don't remember what it was. Guess it seemed important at the time.
GID00006125	Yeah! A good one. Something elegant and classy, you know? But still stylish.
GID00006126	Something that's eye-catching and sexy, but also says "don't fuck with me."
GID00006127	I keep hoping I'll come across some Old World designer gown when I'm scavenging, but it never happens. Maybe I should move back to California.
GID00006128	Can I make it up?
GID00006129	Like what?
GID00006130	Hey, you try getting a date wearing Scribe robes. Might as well be wearing sweatpants.
GID00006131	I just like 'em, you know? They make you feel like a woman. Those ladies before the War, they knew what they were doing.
GID00006132	You can find him in the main embassy building inside the gate and to your left.
GID00006133	Uh... I'm afraid Ambassador Crocker is no longer here. You might want to talk to the receptionist for more information.
GID00006134	This is the NCR Embassy. Our little slice of heaven on the Strip.
GID00006135	The main building houses administration while the other building is the MP headquarters on the Strip.
GID00006136	The usual. Troopers getting drunk and causing problems. Like that's a surprise to anyone.
GID00006137	Hell, I plan on getting drunk once I'm done with my shift. Maybe even head over to Gomorrah for a good time.
GID00006138	You hear about the girls dancing in the fountain? What I wouldn't give to see that show.
GID00006139	Not much other than the Brahmin being chased down the street. That's a little unusual even for the Strip.
GID00006140	I heard some of the Troopers are sneaking up on the rooftops and lounging around and drinking beers instead of working.
GID00006141	They'll be in a world of trouble if Captain Pappas catches them.
GID00006142	Someone thought it would be fun to put graffiti up everywhere. At least I don't have to clean it up.
GID00006143	More of the same. People gambling, getting drunk, and having a good time.
GID00006144	Well, there's the Lucky 38, Ultra-Luxe, Gomorrah, and The Tops. Which one do you want to know about?
GID00006145	Well, there's Vault 21 and the NCR Embassy. Both places are located on the south side of the Strip.
GID00006146	Vault 21 is a small hotel and gift shop. It's not as nice as the casinos, but it's a whole hell of a lot cheaper.
GID00006147	The NCR Embassy is the headquarters for the NCR on the Strip. The Ambassador and his offices are there as well as the MP headquarters.
GID00006148	Well it's time to pop your Vegas cherry, friend! I'm sure you'll have a blast and be drunk and capless in no time.
GID00006149	I can give you a bit more information about the various casinos if you're not sure on where to get started.
GID00006150	Okay then. You should know the rules. Just stay out of trouble, and have fun.
GID00006151	You're not getting started off on the right foot here. The NCR still has a strong presence here and can make your stay unpleasant.
GID00006152	You better watch yourself out there. A loose cannon like yourself can sometimes run out of luck at just the wrong time.
GID00006153	Don't know much about it to tell the truth.
GID00006154	That's where Mr. House and his Securitrons are set up, but no one's been in there as long as people can remember.
GID00006155	Probably best that you just ignore it.
GID00006156	The Ultra-Luxe is the nicest casino on the Strip. Real high-end, extravagant, and expensive. Best you have a lot of caps if you want to go there.
GID00006157	Gomorrah is the favorite of the NCR troops on the Strip. If you like girls, alcohol, gambling, and drugs then Gomorrah is just the place for you.
GID00006158	The Tops is the cool place to be right now. Lots of entertainment and shows going on there as well as the gambling.
GID00006159	If you want to catch a show and have a few drinks, you should definitely hit up the Aces Theater in The Tops.
GID00006160	Ask away.
GID00006161	A crude question, crudely asked.
GID00006162	I'll be happy to satisfy your rambunctious curiosity at a more appropriate moment. But now, I'll repeat my question...
GID00006163	What do you make of what you've seen?
GID00006164	Take it.
GID00006165	Take it.
GID00006166	This is what I have right now.
GID00006167	Let me know when you've decided.
GID00006168	Here you go.
GID00006169	Here you go.
GID00006170	Here you go.
GID00006171	Stake a claim somewhere else, pretty boy.
GID00006172	Looking for target practice, you keep talking.
GID00006173	Wanted to be with someone who knew how to please a woman, that's what.
GID00006174	No, and ain't looking to be a babysitter, neither.
GID00006175	Somebody's asking for a boot in their fusebox.
GID00006176	| Wild Wasteland |Ain't nothing but a hound dog.
GID00006177	I'm not the man you need, pretty boy.
GID00006178	Show me one, and I'll do him proud.
GID00006179	Got enough on my shoulders without adding more dead weight to 'em.
GID00006180	A drink wouldn't make you any prettier, slick.
GID00006181	As long as you leave right after you put your caps down, you're on.
GID00006182	Looking for love or to put me to sleep, kid?
GID00006183	If you're looking for action, grab some grease from your hair and give your gun a few pulls.
GID00006184	Not interested in any weapon that shoots blanks.
GID00006185	Not for all the whiskey in Reno.
GID00006186	Barking up the wrong bar stool, kid.
GID00006187	If you're looking for action, jam your dick in a locker and slam it a few times.
GID00006188	An interesting story. It may even be true.
GID00006189	Under normal circumstances, your story wouldn't make any difference. You'd be dead already.
GID00006190	Lucky for you - probably - Elder McNamara wants to meet you. So follow me. Closely. Or you'll be killed.
GID00006191	The password you gave is valid, but old. The only way you could have gotten it is from one of our lost patrols.
GID00006192	I'm the one asking the questions right now, and you still haven't answered me. I suggest you start doing so.
GID00006193	That's no longer an option, on account of you having one of our passwords. Now if you'd stop stalling, I'd really like to know where you learned it.
GID00006194	I'm here to make sure the bunker stays in one piece.
GID00006195	I'm a master at repairing things, so I check in every so often to make sure all the equipment here is in top working condition.
GID00006196	If you ever have any gear you need fixed, don't hesitate to ask.
GID00006197	I like to check up on things from time to time. I can't let this place fall apart, now can I?
GID00006198	Since you're here, I can offer you some medical supplies. I can't give you everything I have but I can give you a few things.
GID00006199	Here you go.
GID00006200	Here you go.
GID00006201	Okay, I'll have them here for you if you want them.
GID00006202	I'm here to keep everything in order. As a friend of the Legion, I can offer you some supplies while you're here.
GID00006203	I'm here to dust off the cobwebs, make sure everything is working, that sort of thing.
GID00006204	Sometimes it can be a while between visits by rangers so it's good to have someone around to keep the lights on for them.
GID00006205	I also bring ammo supplies with me for any rangers who may be running low. If you need any feel free to ask.
GID00006206	Well, I shouldn't have come within a mile of here. I know that. These poor people.
GID00006207	Seems like either way, there's not much I can do to help anyone.
GID00006208	I think maybe it's safer if I don't try.
GID00006209	No... I don't, do I? If I did, none of this would've happened.
GID00006210	I should've left a long time ago. Cut my losses before it came to this.
GID00006211	I never stood a chance.
GID00006212	Isn't that what I just said? I know I'm responsible.
GID00006213	I was just trying to put it all behind me. Find someplace where what I do would actually have some influence.
GID00006214	I should've expected this, though. Different story, same ending.
GID00006215	No. Not a chance in hell. I'm not risking this happening again.
GID00006216	I'm gonna have to keep to myself. Better that way. For everyone.
GID00006217	I'll still finish what I started with you, though. If you're not afraid, that is. I'll just try not to get too caught up in it all.
GID00006218	Good, I've got more work than time to do it.
GID00006219	An alliance? That's an interesting proposition - any plan where I can throw packs of raiders at the enemy instead of my own soldiers is a good one.
GID00006220	An alliance? That's an interesting proposition - any plan where I can throw packs of raiders at the enemy instead of my own soldiers is a good one.
GID00006221	Oh shit. Oh shit shit shit.
GID00006222	We don't have time for diplomacy. This battle is coming any time now; if the leader won't be budged, he'll have to be replaced.
GID00006223	I want you to go back to Red Rock Canyon and assassinate this Papa Khan. You'll have to be stealthy - if they see you do it, they'll kill you.
GID00006224	Here, take this lockpicking gear. Your best bet is to wait until late at night find a back door, or catch him by surprise when he's alone.
GID00006225	Good luck, soldier.
GID00006226	Dismissed.
GID00006227	Then why are you wasting my time?
GID00006228	Dismissed!
GID00006229	Oh no. No, no, no, no, no, no.
GID00006230	I'm afraid I'm not that kind of doctor. I'm a research scientist.
GID00006231	You may want to try Old Mormon Fort in Freeside. They should have a doctor on duty.
GID00006232	Possibly, but I'd be the wrong person to ask. You'll need to speak to Dr. Schiller, who's on an errand at one of our other stations.
GID00006233	He should be back tomorrow.
GID00006234	No.
GID00006235	This is just a site for local Followers to pick up assignments and check in.
GID00006236	So most of the time we're just taking care of logistics and coordinating with other checkpoints over the radio.
GID00006237	No. We don't expect him back until tomorrow.
GID00006238	That doesn't matter in the slightest. You are an accessory to treason simply by association.
GID00006239	In the name of the Elder, I hereby sentence you to death.
GID00006240	She has made her intentions plain. We will not risk any further damage.
GID00006241	Did you just-? How dare you belch in the face of a Paladin of the Brotherhood of Steel?!
GID00006242	No, I don't wear it on- Enough.
GID00006243	Well, I'll answer what I can.
GID00006244	Ask away.
GID00006245	I guess I don't have anywhere better to be.
GID00006246	Don't go getting yourself shot.
GID00006247	Swooping in on a vertibird, guns blazing? Haven't done that in years, but all right, I'm in.
GID00006248	None of this means a thing if the rest of the group doesn't show up, though.
GID00006249	Oh, and you'll need my part of the pass phrase to get into the bunker - "Navarro."
GID00006250	It really must be bad out there if he's sending you to us. Is the idea that we swoop in by vertibird, guns blazing?
GID00006251	Well, assuming our equipment cache is intact, my squad would have the edge in armor and firepower.
GID00006252	There's only a handful of us, though, so the best tactic would be for us to swoop in where the target isn't expecting us. How am I doing?
GID00006253	Moreno, Johnson, Henry, and I will be the boots on the ground. Whitman will stay with the vertibird.
GID00006254	This was a minor refueling station for vertibirds. It seemed an appropriate place to stash our equipment if we ever needed.
GID00006255	I'm surprised this place hasn't fallen apart. When I put it into standby mode, I expected to return to it within a few years, not decades.
GID00006256	You still need time to think?
GID00006257	We'll be there when you need us.
GID00006258	Then that's the plan. We're going to have a problem with Moreno, though. He won't like that we're helping the NCR - you'll have to talk to him.
GID00006259	Well, now. An opportunity for payback after all these years. Johnson won't go along with it, though - he actually likes the NCR.
GID00006260	I stopped being Moreno's officer a long time ago. Everyone here respects me, but they don't need to follow my orders. Not anymore.
GID00006261	He won't turn on us, but he's a good shot and I'd hate to do this without him.
GID00006262	They won, we didn't. It's as simple as that. The rest of us moved on while Moreno... didn't.
GID00006263	Still, I'm not convinced Moreno hates the NCR as much as he thinks he does. You still might be able to talk him out of leaving.
GID00006264	I stopped being Johnson's officer a long time ago. Everyone here respects me, but they don't need to follow my orders. Not anymore.
GID00006265	He won't turn on us, but he's a good shot and I'd hate to do this without him.
GID00006266	No, I'm afraid. Johnson truly hates the Legion.
GID00006267	[SUCCEEDED] I can't believe you've actually talked me into this. Fine, I'm in, but don't expect me to hold my fire if any NCR troops get in the way.
GID00006268	[FAILED] Sorry, but there's no glory in helping out the NCR.
GID00006269	So you help them at the Dam only to screw them over big time later? All right, I'll go along with this, then. I hope I don't regret it.
GID00006270	Change of plan - you'll find that I've sealed the doors to this hangar - I don't want my friends getting involved in our little disagreement.
GID00006271	Once I'm done with you, I'll talk them out of this stupid plan. You've opened some old wounds - it's only fair I return the favor.
GID00006272	Getting my gear, what does it look like? What, you think I'm going to leave this here for someone like you? I don't think so.
GID00006273	No amount of caps will ever repay what the NCR robbed from me.
GID00006274	Good man. He's one of the Followers of the Apocalypse. He's the one who taught people around here how to start growing crops.
GID00006275	Westside wouldn't be what it is without Anderson helping us out, so I cut him a deal on his rent.
GID00006276	Anything else I can help you with?
GID00006277	[SUCCEEDED] True. All right. The first try was a little less "professional". Someone important on the Strip had access to some of House's technology.
GID00006278	Specifically, a Securitron. And more specifically, the "someone" was Benny. I know, I know... he shot you in the head and everything.
GID00006279	But this was a while ago. I knew he was sleazy, but I didn't realize he was so cold-blooded.
GID00006280	[FAILED] Just drop it, okay?
GID00006281	What do you want to know?
GID00006282	See you when I see you.
GID00006283	He sure didn't. Benny was pretty tight-lipped and cryptic about the thing, but he did let me poke around in it for a while.
GID00006284	I wound up helping Benny a lot more than he helped me. Once he had access to the Securiton's memory banks, he kicked me out of the Tops.
GID00006285	Big surprise, right? I should have seen that coming.
GID00006286	The Securitron was disabled somehow. Might have been an EMP, given some of the damage I saw.
GID00006287	Anyway, he wanted it re-enabled and connected to Mr. House's data network. The trick was getting it to be invisible on the network.
GID00006288	If Mr. House detects a "rogue" Securitron in his system, he remotely fries it. Getting around that security feature was a bit tricky.
GID00006289	Ugh. So gross. It was bad enough that I didn't get any data out of the Securitron. This is why I didn't want to talk about it.
GID00006290	It only happened once. I chalk it up to sleep deprivation and one atomic cocktail too many.
GID00006291	Yes, strange as it sounds, I figured that bad mouthing one of the Strip's most powerful people wasn't a good idea.
GID00006292	The only reason I'm telling you any of this is because he's gone now.
GID00006293	Be careful they don't charge us any tolls.
GID00006294	Don't tell them where we're from - or headed.
GID00006295	Okay, just let me know when you want to talk numbers.
GID00006296	Ah, it's nothing. You just looked like the health inspector who stopped through for the yearly inspection a couple weeks back.
GID00006297	I was hoping I wouldn't have to wait another 11 months to see his crooked ass to get my caps back. Ah well, anything I can get you?
GID00006298	Please... leave us alone.
GID00006299	Take care of yourself.
GID00006300	The Brotherhood? Well, this is unusual, I must say. But very welcome.
GID00006301	There's certainly a lot we could learn from your technological expertise.
GID00006302	Doctor Schiller usually handles placement, and he won't be back until tomorrow. If you could come back then, we can see about your assignment.
GID00006303	That's it! We got it! The virus has been purged!
GID00006304	Great! When you find it, just turn it into Torres and I'll be in the clear.
GID00006305	Oh, I sort of altered the records after we got back. That was Watkins' idea, too. That girl is nothing but trouble.
GID00006306	Still, I haven't been exiled yet, or worse, assigned to latrine-cleaning duty. But I will, if you don't help me find that gun.
GID00006307	Oh man, I am so screwed! Look, if you change your mind, I'd really appreciate it.
GID00006308	No, no idea. Sorry.
GID00006309	Okay, see you around.
GID00006310	Hey, no pressure. I'm just grateful you're willing to help me out.
GID00006311	I'm pretty sure I dropped in when we made our escape. We had been surrounded and had climbed up on this big rock to hold them off.
GID00006312	Oh, and I remember seeing a corpse near the rock, too. We never got a chance to check it out since we were too busy fighting for our lives.
GID00006313	Guess we had better luck than whoever that was, huh?
GID00006314	Good luck!
GID00006315	No, weapon check-in protocol includes verifying the serial number of the weapon, so a different gun would be noticed.
GID00006316	Plus, having a new gun suddenly show up would immediately point to you, being the only outsider around here and all.
GID00006317	No, the only way I have out of this is if you help me find that gun. You'll help me, right?
GID00006318	This is excellent news. I'll send him back to you soon.
GID00006319	Yeah, I'm in charge of keeping this data system up and running, but accessing it is a little, ah, touch and go at the moment.
GID00006320	One of our exploratory patrols - back when we had exploratory patrols - found a data disc in some ruins out in the waste.
GID00006321	Well, we finally got around to cataloging the damn thing and got shut out of our own datastore the second it loaded. Turns out it had a virus on it.
GID00006322	Oh, there are patrols. Just not exploratory ones. We've been in a state of lockdown for... well, let's just say it's been a while.
GID00006323	The only time anyone gets to go topside is guard duty. Or to gather provisions. Other than that, it's steel walls and fluorescent lights for us.
GID00006324	Nah, it's not so bad. The world outside isn't exactly a paradise, you know? Still, you can only breathe recirculated air for so long.
GID00006325	We've got more than a few people in here who are going a little stir crazy.
GID00006326	Yeah, some Pre-War jackass with too much time on his hands apparently decided to inflict his misery on those around him.
GID00006327	It's scrambling all the terminals here at the moment. Luckily, we only use this section for storing historical data.
GID00006328	I suppose it couldn't hurt to get another pair of eyes on this. Maybe you'll be able to come up with something coming at it fresh.
GID00006329	While the entire system is infected, the virus itself is spread across three terminals. The problem is that it keeps moving periodically.
GID00006330	We'll have it nailed down in a terminal or two, only to have it jump to another set of terminals before we locate the third.
GID00006331	You'll need to locate it on three different terminals in this area in one minute. Any longer and it'll jump, and you'll have to start all over.
GID00006332	Locating the virus would probably be nearly impossible, but the pompous little bastard that wrote it made things a little easier for us.
GID00006333	Normally, terminals infected by the virus just display gibberish, but we found that terminals the virus moved to had some real data passed to them.
GID00006334	We were able to decrypt the data and discovered that it was just messages from the virus's writer, taunting his victims.
GID00006335	When you find terminals with those messages, lock them down and move on. Find three of them before the virus jumps, and we'll wipe the damn thing.
GID00006336	That's... not really for me to say. It's a bit of a touchy subject. You should probably forget I mentioned it.
GID00006337	Please, don't let me stop you. I know what it's like to have a lot on your mind.
GID00006338	You and me both. The Elder wants this data store operational pronto, but it doesn't look like the damn thing will be working anytime soon.
GID00006339	I could use some assistance, sure, but I highly doubt you have the technical background to help us deal with this virus.
GID00006340	Best of luck to you. I'll tell the others to take a break so they don't get in your way. Oh, and I'll keep track of when it jumps for you.
GID00006341	To maximize your chances, wait for my signal before you begin.
GID00006342	We'll get it eventually, but it's frustrating that it's taking so long.
GID00006343	[SUCCEEDED] What? No, that... that's brilliant! It would let us seal a portion of the virus to a particular terminal, even when the other parts move.
GID00006344	[FAILED] Along with all of the crucial data contained within. That'd be like throwing the baby out with the bathwater.
GID00006345	I'm almost out of ideas, so you'd be more than welcome to.
GID00006346	Watch your six out there.
GID00006347	Hmmph.
GID00006348	Is that right? The million dollar question is who exactly are we "settling?"
GID00006349	You can thank the NCR for that one. Wait - this isn't on behalf of the NCR, is it?
GID00006350	You're doing a fine job of convincing me to go along with this. Really. I'll ask again - why us?
GID00006351	Good idea.
GID00006352	I think that'd be best. There's a Followers outpost up near one of my old scavenging grounds. Used to do some trading with a doctor there.
GID00006353	If I work out of there, I'll still be able to keep tabs on Hidden Valley if I needed to. I know that route like the back of my hand.
GID00006354	If it's all right, I'd like to head that way. Meet some people, see if I can be of any use.
GID00006355	Yeah. I think if I stayed I'd end up causing trouble. Sometimes I just can't help myself.
GID00006356	This way is better for me and for them.
GID00006357	Well, crops aren't doing so well. I'm thinking it might be something in the water.
GID00006358	The pump station is pretty run down, you could go take a look around the place, see if you find anything strange going on. What do you say?
GID00006359	See you around.
GID00006360	Thanks, that's great!
GID00006361	I should get back to work now, see you around.
GID00006362	Ten seconds!
GID00006363	Thirty seconds left!
GID00006364	The virus just jumped! Find which terminals it went to!
GID00006365	All right. I'll monitor when it jumps. When I give the signal, start checking terminals.
GID00006366	We'll continue our own efforts in the meantime.
GID00006367	Damn, it's jumped! I thought we might have had it that time.
GID00006368	Yeah, but only if you've got bodies to fill the suits. We don't take on new members. We're all descendents from the original Brotherhood.
GID00006369	Something's going to have to change, or the empty suits are gonna be all that's left of us.
GID00006370	I think you're right. We're getting desperate. Hardly enough people to sustain ourselves as a chapter. They'll see the light, sooner or later.
GID00006371	But I get the feeling if I don't take matters into my own hands, the change won't come in time to make a difference.
GID00006372	Wow, you sound like Elder McNamara. I know I should. Hell, it's what I signed up for when I chose to stay into adulthood.
GID00006373	I know there's something worth saving in there. But we're in decline. Our membership is... decimated. There's got to be something we can do.
GID00006374	I know the odds aren't good, but I've gotta try. I can't lose them.
GID00006375	I don't know. I'm still thinking about what kind of role we could take on that would give us the best chance of survival.
GID00006376	But I think things are starting to come together.
GID00006377	Sure, but how long before the NCR or Caesar's Legion track us down and take it by force anyway?
GID00006378	But if we recruited Knights from outside the group, maybe we could actually defend it.
GID00006379	Yeah. I've got the rest of my life to help them out. I can spare a little while to see things through with you.
GID00006380	Sure. I want to establish a connection with the Followers first, but as far as I know, drifting is part of the job description.
GID00006381	No, I think it is. I have to be resolved about this. If I waver, it'll just make things harder.
GID00006382	They need me and I'm not going to abandon them.
GID00006383	I think so. Two things the Brotherhood has a lot of - hardheads and lasers. Wouldn't be the first time a disagreement ended like this.
GID00006384	Plus... we killed all the witnesses.
GID00006385	No, wait... please. Mr. House has access to technology that could help save a lot of lives, lives of people who suffer a great deal.
GID00006386	Unlike Mr. House, refugees in New Vegas don't have the luxury of constant medical care. Some of them don't even have regular access to clean water.
GID00006387	I guess we can thank NCR for that. Anyway, just a bit of information about Mr. House's technology could go a long way.
GID00006388	We were connected for half a minute and received enough data to fill five holodiscs. It looked like nonsense at first, but we decoded it.
GID00006389	It was all biometric data, life signs from Mr. House. The technology he's using is so advanced that it samples data hundreds of times per second.
GID00006390	It's fascinating, but depressing. Whatever technology he has can't possibly be practical for the people out here.
GID00006391	About five years now. I have family back in Arroyo, but this is where all of the good work is being done, so to speak.
GID00006392	NCR taxes and inflation have been hard for a lot of people to deal with, and most of the money is going to the war effort.
GID00006393	There's not much funding for medical research with OSI or any other group - not unless it has a military application, anyway.
GID00006394	I'm interested in medicine, but it's not my strong suit. I try to help out with any computer issues the Followers have.
GID00006395	That's why I was helping out with the research into Mr. House's technology. Trying to, anyway.
GID00006396	After two tries, I think I've learned enough. I'm sure there's something more promising I could be helping the other Followers with.
GID00006397	Uh... oh yeah, I didn't tell you about the first time. I'd rather not talk about it, if you don't mind.
GID00006398	I already told you, I don't want to talk about it.
GID00006399	Greetings, General Oliver. The disappointment you are about to experience delights me.
GID00006400	Greetings, General.
GID00006401	Hello, General.
GID00006402	General, we like your hat.
GID00006403	General, you look well. Perhaps for not much longer.
GID00006404	Point guns at us, and we will destroy you.
GID00006405	Please do not struggle, General Oliver, you might hurt yourself. I will release you presently.
GID00006406	Please do not struggle, General Oliver, you might hurt yourself. You can relax presently.
GID00006407	Hold up there, that looks like Enclave tech. Take that over to Knight Lorenzo if you get a moment, he may be able to get some information out of it.
GID00006408	Really? What kind of logs? What kind of data does he have on it?
GID00006409	Great, I'd love to take a look at that log data.
GID00006410	Did... did you say Poseidon Energy? I've been researching some Poseidon projects here.
GID00006411	Do you think you could leave your robot with me for a few days? I have some materials that I can use to upgrade his armor while he's here.
GID00006412	Oh, well if you change your mind let me know. I have some parts here I can use to upgrade his armor if you leave it with me for a bit.
GID00006413	Yes, I know. It was detected immediately and deactivated... let's see... 39.735 seconds after you planted it.
GID00006414	You thought I wouldn't notice?
GID00006415	One of the Followers of the Apocalypse, I'm sure. They're curious about me.
GID00006416	Good luck planting a surveillance device here in the Lucky 38 without my knowing about it.
GID00006417	Run! Beasts got free!
GID00006418	Deathclaws are loose! Get out of here!
GID00006419	It can't be! How the hell...
GID00006420	Holy shit! Run for your lives!
GID00006421	You've cleaned that vermin's nest? Gotta say, we don't see that kind of attitude around here. Good work!
GID00006422	Goodbye.
GID00006423	That's unfortunate, but it's not like we're losing any existing business over it. Thanks for looking.
GID00006424	That's unfortunate, but it's not like we're losing any existing business over it. Thanks for looking.
GID00006425	That's unfortunate, but it's not like we're losing any existing business over it. Thanks for looking.
GID00006426	That's unfortunate, but it's not like we're losing any existing business over it. Thanks for looking.
GID00006427	That's unfortunate, but it's not like we're losing any existing business over it. Thanks for looking.
GID00006428	That's unfortunate, but it's not like we're losing any existing business over it. Thanks for looking.
GID00006429	That's unfortunate, but it's not like we're losing any existing business over it. Thanks for looking.
GID00006430	[SUCCEEDED] Oh all right. You did the legwork, so I suppose you deserve a tip. Here.
GID00006431	[FAILED] Here's a tip, kid. If you want to get paid, get the job done to completion.
GID00006432	Yep, thanks for the help.
GID00006433	Well, the Van Graffs for one. We had a slight difference of opinion when they first showed up.
GID00006434	Changed our minds pretty quick after a brief demonstration of how much firepower they're packing.
GID00006435	We could probably take them, but we'd lose a lotta guys doing it.
GID00006436	People can do whatever they want, they just have to keep in mind what'll happen afterward.
GID00006437	I guess you could say we don't have law so much as consequences.
GID00006438	Aside from this place, there's the Atomic Wrangler just up the street. Women, gambling, booze, you name it, they got you covered.
GID00006439	If you're more of a prude, the Followers run a mission out of the Old Mormon Fort up toward the north gate. Great place if you're hurt, I guess.
GID00006440	If you like things dangerous, just past the Wrangler is the Silver Rush, where the Van Graff family peddles their weapons.
GID00006441	Their stuff is outrageously priced, but if you want to shoot something hi-tech, they're the best game in town.
GID00006442	Look, I already told you that was bullshit. Probably just an excuse those lying soldier scum made up to not share their grub with us.
GID00006443	So don't ask me about it again, you hear me?
GID00006444	Wonderful. Then let's begin making a whole new you!
GID00006445	You wound me! You simply must let me have a go at that hair sometime! Anything you can imagine, I can style!
GID00006446	We've tried to pass our philosophy on to the people of Freeside, but not everyone is ready to be a King.
GID00006447	The kids love us, but the old-timers tend to shy away and keep to themselves. They probably couldn't pull off the look, anyway.
GID00006448	As for the others, some people just plain don't respect others, and that's a no-no. If there's one thing I won't tolerate, it's lack of respect.
GID00006449	Pace? He and I grew up together around here. We've been through a lot together, and there's no man I'd rather have at my side in a pinch.
GID00006450	Don't judge him too harshly for trying to get some caps out of you. He probably took you for a squatter, looking for a place to settle down.
GID00006451	There've been a lot of people moving into the area lately, and it's got some people riled. Can't blame 'em myself. There's only so much to go around.
GID00006452	There's me, but I don't really like talking about myself. There's Julie Farkas and the other Followers down at the ol' Mormon Fort.
GID00006453	The Garret Twins up at the Wrangler deserve mention. Wouldn't be right not mentioning the Van Graffs, I suppose.
GID00006454	And while they're not important in the overall scheme of things, there's Mick and Ralph, too. Just don't tell them I said that.
GID00006455	Who all did you want to know about?
GID00006456	Julie represents the Followers of the Apocalypse. They're a group that tries to help people out whenever they can, so we get along just fine.
GID00006457	If you ever need to get patched up, one of their docs'll have you right as rain in no time flat. They sell supplies, too. Or used to.
GID00006458	Heard they were having trouble bringing stuff in, or keeping up with the demand, or something, lately.
GID00006459	Did you want to know about anyone else?
GID00006460	Them twins run the Atomic Wrangler, the only working casino here in Freeside. It's become pretty much the place to go around these parts.
GID00006461	Give it a whirl when you've got some time. Now, was there anyone else you wanted to know about?
GID00006462	They're a family-run business from out west that deal in weapons mostly. A word of caution, though. They're not a friendly bunch. Not at all.
GID00006463	Their store is just past the Wrangler, and sells all kinds of fancy weapons that most people around here can't afford.
GID00006464	Anyone else you wanted to know about?
GID00006465	Mick and Ralph sell all sorts of things at a small store over by the east gate. They've done all right by us, and they'll do all right by you.
GID00006466	You want to know about anyone else?
GID00006467	Well, at least I can talk to you unlike that bastard Caesar and that plate-faced general. It'll do.
GID00006468	Guess sometimes you get the bull, other times you get the horns. Still, at least some lives got saved this day.
GID00006469	I'm not going to throw away the lives of my men just to make a point. And there'll be other days.
GID00006470	Lot of PreWar factories and tech lying around the Mojave, our engineers'll get it running again, no matter how much damage you've done down there.
GID00006471	Right now, they're all that's standing here - well, except for the corpses. So that's your plan, hold the Dam here all by your lonesome?
GID00006472	[SUCCEEDED] Yeah... but I wasn't expecting a fight when I came up here. And now that we're talking, I don't like the sound of things.
GID00006473	[FAILED] That so, well, if all you brought is words, then this is going to be one short conversation.
GID00006474	Even if we're running at one percent for a year, it's still worth holding this place.
GID00006475	[SUCCEEDED] Of all the goddamn luck...
GID00006476	[FAILED] Oh, "last you looked," huh? Yeah, we'll take another look... after you haul ass outta here.
GID00006477	[SUCCEEDED] Fucking PreWar RobCo pieces of shit...
GID00006478	[FAILED] Yeah, now where would we find an experienced computer specialist in the NCR? We'll find one, don't you worry.
GID00006479	[SUCCEEDED] No... I can tell it'd just be a wasted trip.
GID00006480	[FAILED] Considering how long we've been here, we know it well. We've patched this place up plenty - we'll get it running again.
GID00006481	They wouldn't.
GID00006482	[SUCCEEDED] No... no, you're here in the Legate's camp first, I think that says enough.
GID00006483	[FAILED] And maybe you fed him a line of Brahmin shit, too, enough to make his dumb ass think twice... I ain't Legion, and I need more than words.
GID00006484	The Brotherhood? On the attack? I think we would have heard something from them by now.
GID00006485	[SUCCEEDED] This has been a fuck of a day.
GID00006486	[FAILED] No, I think they blew their load here today with their fireworks... they'll prefer targets closer to home.
GID00006487	I think you're cashed out enough that my chances are pretty good. And like I said, I'm not leaving the Dam now the Legion's been broken.
GID00006488	[SUCCEEDED] Godammit.
GID00006489	[FAILED] If that's the best you can muster, then it's you who should be backing up slow, and your buddies with you.
GID00006490	And we're glad to have you - and whether you're a soldier of the Republic or not, you're it in my eyes.
GID00006491	Sometimes the Republic gets lost along the way while it's trying to follow its instincts... but when soldiers like you come along...
GID00006492	It helps get them back on track, and does it by example. And what you've done here today, that's going to keep us going for a while.
GID00006493	[SUCCEEDED] The Brotherhood? Last thing we fucking need now.
GID00006494	[FAILED] Yeah, and we'll kick their ass again like we did at HELIOS One - tell them to come, we got a whole mess of armor-piercing rounds.
GID00006495	Least we could do. And seeing those shits of Caesar kicking dirt as they ran - did my heart good, let me tell you.
GID00006496	Might see some recruitment numbers rise, build some morale out in the Mojave long enough for NCR to find its feet again.
GID00006497	All due to you - again, you have my thanks. And all the West, too, once they pass it over the radio... after signing the right release forms.
GID00006498	[SUCCEEDED] First the Legion, then the Brotherhood hitting us is about the last thing the Republic needs right now.
GID00006499	[FAILED] Yeah, and we'll kick their ass again like we did at HELIOS One - tell them to come, we got a whole mess of armor-piercing rounds.
GID00006500	[SUCCEEDED] This has been a fuck of a day.
GID00006501	[FAILED] You go on and do that. Me? I think they shot their last wad today... from now on, they'll prefer targets closer to home.
GID00006502	Look. The NCR isn't everyone here, and it definitely ain't you.
GID00006503	It's filled with people that take action and don't wait for someone to say what's right and what's wrong and make sure the proper form's filled out.
GID00006504	When there's an example of that kind of success... that can shake things up enough so the good that came with the intention shines through.
GID00006505	Figured as much. Come on, you sons of bitches, we're ready.
GID00006506	I think you're cashed out enough that my chances are pretty good. And like I said, I'm not leaving the Dam now the Legion's been broken.
GID00006507	[SUCCEEDED] True, guess I'm a little too used to seeing Securitrons in Vegas to think they'd turn and be bad news - and I know how bad they can get.
GID00006508	[FAILED] If that's your idea of diplomacy, then things are looking miles better on my side of the fence.
GID00006509	Looking to make a deal, then? All right... let's hear it.
GID00006510	You sure got its heart beating in new ways... but that just makes me want all of it, not handouts.
GID00006511	[SUCCEEDED] If you're buying our ear for the moment, Hoover Dam's more than a fistful of caps to my superiors. Vegas is interesting... the East...
GID00006512	That'll take too long to build up to generate capital - 'course, since you'd have to guard it during that time... don't know, could go either way.
GID00006513	[FAILED] What, loot we'd get anyway once we kicked your ass and more? No, I don't think so.
GID00006514	[SUCCEEDED] Hnh. Willing to tackle the caravan families? Keeping that bunch in line... well, that's no easy job.
GID00006515	In fact, that's such a shitty job, those caravan families will be the one bottlecapping you to death inch by inch - and that sounds good to me.
GID00006516	Be a nice turnabout from your friend, House, and all the bottlecapping he's been doing to NCR for years. Sounds sweet to me.
GID00006517	[FAILED] With your wheeled buddies as merchants? No, the East is going to be a hard nut to crack, and I don't think you know what you're in for.
GID00006518	[SUCCEEDED] So you're saying without you, Hoover Dam just beats slower and dies. I believe it, I saw it myself this day, you woke it up, true enough.
GID00006519	Still, even power from the Dam - that's not enough to wash the salt out of the wound here, and it only benefits NCR in the Mojave, not the West.
GID00006520	[FAILED] Well, that kind of fence-sitting is exactly what makes me think we can make use of the... improvements here. Without you.
GID00006521	[SUCCEEDED] Hmmm. Well... Vegas burns brighter than most cities West of the Divide, and that glitter has its appeal.
GID00006522	Not sure that's going to mend fences with the folks back West, though. But...
GID00006523	[FAILED] No, you tricked us once, and taking more gifts from you deeper into NCR's just asking for trouble by my book.
GID00006524	No, no, no... you've given me enough ammo for the Republic... but what one head may like, the other bear head may not.
GID00006525	Still, I'm not about to add blood to the mix since you could've done us like the Legion now if you wanted.
GID00006526	We clean up, take prisoners, watch the East for any more trouble from the Legion... though I think they're still running, according to our scouts.
GID00006527	After that, we'll see what happens when the dust settles and how the Mojave looks now without Caesar coming for its throat.
GID00006528	Something tells me we better enjoy this breather while we can... and if that means Vegas, then you and the troops have earned it.
GID00006529	Course not. You earned it - rest up, let us carry things for a while.
GID00006530	Kind of curious how this is going to pan out in the long run... but I'll guess history'll tell us in its own sweet time.
GID00006531	Can't keep the courier spirit down, eh? Fair enough. We'll clean up here.
GID00006532	You know, I've had thousands of employees in my time. Few met my expectations, fewer still surpassed them.
GID00006533	Your performance has been nothing short of spectacular. If I have need for a "specialist" of your stripe again, I'll know just where to turn.
GID00006534	Back to Vegas, shall we? I really should do something about that monorail - with all the new resources at hand...
GID00006535	I can make sure it not only runs, but runs on time. Always bothered me, the imprecision.
GID00006536	No need to worry about the General, by the way. He'll be held responsible, publicly disgraced... 36.5% probability of suicide, by my estimate...
GID00006537	Kimball won't be able to save him - he'll be too busy getting thrown out of office. But less than a 3% chance of suicide, mind you.
GID00006538	No need to worry about the General's "accident," by the way. A mercy, really, sparing him the disgrace of surviving his nation's defeat...
GID00006539	President Kimball may long to avenge his friend's death, but he won't be President long enough to do anything about it.
GID00006540	The General's "accident" was unfortunate... with Kimball dead, the angry Californian public could've used an alternate scapegoat to pillory...
GID00006541	General Oliver will try to make good on his threats, and he'll find support among citizens outraged by Kimball's assassination...
GID00006542	The odds of the Californian public supporting a full-scale re-invasion, however, are slight. My Securitrons could beat them, anyway.
GID00006543	Vegas might see a dip in revenue for a few months, half a year - but soon enough the tourists - and their money - will be pouring in.
GID00006544	In any case, Vegas might see a dip in revenue for a year or two, but eventually the tourists will come flooding back, and their money with them.
GID00006545	Vegas will be a shining jewel in the middle of the desert, an oasis of light, a beacon to show mankind the way to the stars.
GID00006546	This is just the start, you see. This is where it all begins.
GID00006547	Actually, I've got a better idea. Make the new hire tell her. You'll do that for me, won't you?
GID00006548	Hey, I've seen you before around our place. You've really fallen on hard times if you're working for these clowns.
GID00006549	Hey, you're the one who helped us out with those NCR chumps. You really get around, don't you?
GID00006550	Hey, Simon. How's it hanging? Looks like you've got a little helper today.
GID00006551	What can I say? Business has been good lately. We can afford the help.
GID00006552	Good to hear, buddy. So is the boss lady in?
GID00006553	You know she is. Why don't you go in and say hi?
GID00006554	Nah, I've got some rounds to run. But do pass along that I'm always thinking of her.
GID00006555	See? Told you so.
GID00006556	Now what in the hell do you suppose that was about?
GID00006557	Looks like that guy's headed this way. Don't screw it up.
GID00006558	Help me clean this up. No one's going to want to shop here with a corpse out front.
GID00006559	You're doing that on purpose, aren't you?
GID00006560	Stop him!
GID00006561	I could use some help out here!
GID00006562	Heads up. Looks like we've got another customer.
GID00006563	He's clean.
GID00006564	You just going to let everyone in without checking them? Bad move, rookie. That's going in my report.
GID00006565	You keep losing us business like that, and you can forget about being paid.
GID00006566	You don't listen too well, do you? We're supposed to pat everyone down. That's going in my report.
GID00006567	Wow, you're a real people person, aren't you?
GID00006568	Another one coming. You're on.
GID00006569	You know, guarding the door's not that complicated. Maybe you'd be better off in another line of work.
GID00006570	It's almost like I never said anything at all.
GID00006571	He's clean.
GID00006572	See? Not so hard is it?
GID00006573	Crap. This I do not need today. Keep your head straight, rookie. Things are about to get interesting.
GID00006574	Come on, help me clean this up.
GID00006575	Oh man, Gloria's going to be pissed when she hears about this. Still, he started it, so we probably won't go to war with the Kings.
GID00006576	Way to keep your head, rookie. There's hope for you yet.
GID00006577	What the hell are you doing?
GID00006578	We're supposed to pat everyone down. Didn't you hear that part of my instructions?
GID00006579	Were you even listening when I said what you're supposed to do?
GID00006580	It's almost like I never said anything at all.
GID00006581	You're doing it on purpose, aren't you?
GID00006582	What did I tell you about trying to make off with that gear?
GID00006583	I'm afraid I'm going to have to search you before letting you in. The only weapons allowed on the premises are the ones we're selling.
GID00006584	There, I've stowed all of your weapons. You're clear to enter. When you leave, I'll hand them all back to you.
GID00006585	Ah, General Oliver. I expected you would survive.
GID00006586	I see you've met my star employee. A real performer, obviously - and a lot more reliable than the other candidate I considered for the position.
GID00006587	I'd pay very close attention to what she has to say, as well as any official papers she hands over for your perusal.
GID00006588	I'd pay very close attention to what he has to say, as well as any official papers he hands over for your perusal.
GID00006589	Let's get on with it, shall we? Hmm?
GID00006590	Ah, the "rulers" of Freeside. The Kings are a bunch of boys who refuse to grow up, and this is their playground.
GID00006591	Their leader seems different, though. The few times I've dealt with him I've been impressed despite myself.
GID00006592	Unfortunately, he rarely acts. The Kings believe that everyone in Freeside can do whatever they want, provided they can back it up with force.
GID00006593	Which suits us just fine. When we first arrived in Freeside, the Kings protested when we kicked out the original occupant of this establishment.
GID00006594	When we reduced several of their members to glowing puddles of goo, their objections vanished. Since then, we've left each other alone.
GID00006595	I don't really have much to do with them. They seem to have an aversion to weapons technology, and those who possess a great deal of it.
GID00006596	Their loss, really.
GID00006597	Well, you probably noticed the Atomic Wrangler across the street. That's pretty much the place to go around here.
GID00006598	They make it a little loud around here at night, but the business their proximity brings more than makes up for it.
GID00006599	Other than them, you're better off skipping Freeside entirely and just heading to the Strip.
GID00006600	Suits me. What did you have in mind?
GID00006601	It's just a rumor. Even so, I trust you will refrain from bringing up this subject again.
GID00006602	You must not know a lot about my family or you wouldn't have asked that. The Van Graffs and the NCR have been enemies for decades.
GID00006603	They've tried to block our expansion for years, but we've managed to grow regardless. The problem is they have, too.
GID00006604	The NCR is huge, now. We're talking on a scale that's difficult to imagine. Time was, we could fight them and hold our own. Not so anymore.
GID00006605	My family has enough men and guns to field a small army, but the NCR can field a really, really big army. Fighting them is out of the question now.
GID00006606	I've only heard rumors, since this is the furthest east our operations go. But the rumors are pretty scary.
GID00006607	They're said to be a huge slaver nation, with all the soldiers obeying their lord with unquestioning obedience.
GID00006608	Sounds like a man I'd like to meet.
GID00006609	Very little, same as everyone else. We attempted to deal with him when we first moved into the area, but had no luck.
GID00006610	He must have his own weapons supplies to keep as many laser-armed robots operational as he does. Makes me wonder where they are...
GID00006611	They're our chief competitors in this region, and many others. That makes them our enemies.
GID00006612	While I respect their business acumen, I'm obligated to try to destroy them however I can. That's business, after all.
GID00006613	That's a good dog. Well, I'm out of here. Later, Simon.
GID00006614	I would, but I tend to distract the boss lady a little too much. She can't help herself.
GID00006615	Anyway, I've got things to do. Later, Simon.
GID00006616	Ouch, this one's got a bite, Simon! Call him off, or he'll get put down.
GID00006617	Ouch, this one's got a bite, Simon! Call her off, or she'll get put down.
GID00006618	Let's take this chump, guys!
GID00006619	I'm sure it's the highlight of your day. Anyway, I've gotta bounce. Things to do, and all that.
GID00006620	Who do you think you're talking to? Just because the King happens to like you, doesn't mean you can run your mouth any way you damn like.
GID00006621	No, nothing wrong at all. By all means, carry on.
GID00006622	You asked for it, punk!
GID00006623	Yeah, that's what I thought.
GID00006624	Yeah, right before I beat somebody down. Let's take this fool, boys.
GID00006625	Ha, you've got yourself a live one here, Simon. Anyway, I've got things to do. Later.
GID00006626	Spoken like a chump. A King doesn't have to grovel before others to get paid. Anyway, I've got better things to do than shoot the shit with you.
GID00006627	Thanks, I've come a long way.
GID00006628	That's not really necessary, is it? I already told you I got this here revolver, right?
GID00006629	What?
GID00006630	Damn, I knew this wasn't going to work!
GID00006631	You gonna ask me questions all day, or are you going to let me in?
GID00006632	Now hold on there, I'm not packing any heat. Ain't my word good enough for you?
GID00006633	Thank you kindly.
GID00006634	What? Why the hell not?
GID00006635	[SUCCEEDED] I suppose it's all right, if there's no other choice.
GID00006636	[FAILED] I just don't see why it's necessary. Now, are you going to let me in or not?
GID00006637	If that's the case, then I guess I'll go spend my money elsewhere.
GID00006638	I haven't had a drink all day! Screw this place, I'll go spend my money elsewhere!
GID00006639	Hmph. That's better.
GID00006640	Thanks a bunch.
GID00006641	Fine by me.
GID00006642	No... Should I be?
GID00006643	Because I'm not! Can't you just tell? Oh, forget it. I'll just head over to that pawn shop by the east gate.
GID00006644	This should only take a moment.
GID00006645	Then you're not going to shop here.
GID00006646	I can't believe this shit. Time to die, punk!
GID00006647	What did I tell you about breaking the rules? You're gonna learn the hard way, now.
GID00006648	You dared go against The Thorn, and now you'll pay for that!
GID00006649	You've just fucked up, big time!
GID00006650	You've broken the rules of The Thorn, you've dishonored this sacred ground! I don't tolerate such offenses.
GID00006651	I admire your bravery, but coming down here after what you've done is just foolish. So be it, Legion dog!
GID00006652	We're back with Best Friend Tabitha, who was telling us why humans should STAY THE HELL AWAY, ier, keep their distance from the State of Utobitha.
GID00006653	Thank you, Rhonda. As you know, one of the many benefits of living in Utobitha is the ready availability of pet centaurs.
GID00006654	Ooh, I love the centaurs. They're just so cute!
GID00006655	Exactly, Rhonda, who could resist those sweet little faces, and that cute way they shuffle around on all those hands they have.
GID00006656	But humans must be so caught up with their pleasant features that they forget the most important thing about centaurs.
GID00006657	And what might that be, Best Friend Tabitha?
GID00006658	Centaurs eat humans, Rhonda! You see, humans are a lot smaller, and much more tender than you or I, so centaurs naturally see them as food.
GID00006659	Ah, that *would* make it hard for them to get along, wouldn't it?
GID00006660	Indeed. Given the situation, I had to make a hard choice when I created Utobitha - do we invite weak, greedy humans who would just die anyway?
GID00006661	Or cute, loveable centaurs, who fight and die for us and ask nothing in return? After much deliberation, I went with the centaurs.
GID00006662	And there you have it, Utobitha. The next time you play with a huggable, loveable centaur, remember that Best Friend Tabitha made it all possible.
GID00006663	We're here once again with our beloved leader. Best Friend Tabitha, why don't you tell our listeners what you just told me?
GID00006664	I was just saying that I think there's a fundamental misunderstanding about the mutants here in the State of Utobitha.
GID00006665	And what would *that* be?
GID00006666	I believe that the mutants here are generally considered to dislike humans. And nothing could be further from the truth.
GID00006667	During their stay here, mutants are taught to tolerate, and even accept, the existence of inferior, frail creatures, humans included.
GID00006668	Ooh, how insightful! So then how do you think this misunderstanding came about?
GID00006669	My guess is that it has something to do with the fact that every mutant in the State of Utobitha has been give explicit orders regarding security.
GID00006670	Those orders naturally include shooting humans on sight. Or pounding them with whatever happens to be handy. Guns being in short supply, you see.
GID00006671	As I've explained, there are numerous dangers to humans here, and we have a duty to drive them away. It's for their own good, really.
GID00006672	Makes sense to me! And the silly humans think we don't care. For shame. Stick around, Utobitha, for more after this!
GID00006673	Do you remember the good old days where the Master ruled over us all?
GID00006674	When his gentle, compelling, and yet oddly insistent voice crawled through your mind and told you exactly what to do?
GID00006675	Do you miss a time when you didn't have to think for yourself, and enjoyed lazy days of following the bellowed commands of others?
GID00006676	Those days can be yours again, for Best Friend Tabitha, the esteemed leader of the State of Utobitha, is here to tell you what to do!
GID00006677	That's right! I, Tabitha, will take on the burden of your obedience!
GID00006678	Acceptance into Utobitha pending Best Friend Tabitha's approval.
GID00006679	Best Friend Tabitha reserves the right to turn down applicants for any reason, including whimsy or boredom.
GID00006680	Acceptance into Utobitha open to mutants only. Former human servants of the Master conditionally accepted for purposes of centaur feeding duties.
GID00006681	Utobitha! Come, take a load off your mind!
GID00006682	Welcome to another episode of Know - Your - Mutants!
GID00006683	Special guest star Best Friend Tabitha is with us in the studio to share her insights on this topic that affects us all.
GID00006684	Thank you, Rhonda. Today I'd like to talk about a subject near and dear to my heart, the nightkin.
GID00006685	Ooooh, you must know a lot about the nightkin, Best Friend Tabitha, seeing as how you are one!
GID00006686	That's true, Rhonda. I am in a unique position to speak to the natural superiority of my kind.
GID00006687	Our story begins, as most stories do, with the Master. Our glorious leader had created the Super Mutants, but something nagged at him.
GID00006688	"I can do better", he must have said to himself. And boy did he ever!
GID00006689	A new type of mutant was created - stronger, faster, smarter, more dangerous in every way.
GID00006690	We were to normal super mutants what they were to humans, and they were told to defer to us in all things.
GID00006691	And you're the leader of all the nightkin, correct?
GID00006692	Yes, as the highest ranking nightkin alive, my voice speaks for all nightkin everywhere, ever.
GID00006693	Which is why all super mutants should do what you say, right?
GID00006694	That's right! My position of supreme authority must never be questioned!
GID00006695	One last thing. Is there any truth to the rumor that all Nightkin are slightly crazy from their overuse of psychologically damaging pre-war tech?
GID00006696	None at all, Rhonda.
GID00006697	There you have it, Utobitha! Nightkin, your benevolent overlords, who are most certainly *not* crazy. We'll be back after this!
GID00006698	Welcome, Utobitha, to another episode of Know - Your - Mutants!
GID00006699	Today we're proud to have Best Friend Tabitha with us. Welcome to the show!
GID00006700	Good to be here, Rhonda.
GID00006701	So what type of mutant did you want to talk about this time, Best Friend Tabitha?
GID00006702	I thought I'd briefly talk about first generation Super Mutants, Rhonda.
GID00006703	Oooh, what can you tell us about them?
GID00006704	What we call the first generation of Super Mutants, Rhonda, were actually created by the Master himself.
GID00006705	Like everything the Master took a direct hand in, they were better than the ones who came later, the ones made by accident.
GID00006706	They were smarter, almost as smart as Nightkin, and were able to think and act for themselves.
GID00006707	However, the first generation seems to have some kind of suicidal urge that they can't control.
GID00006708	How terrible! What makes you say that, Best Friend Tabitha?
GID00006709	So far, all first generation Super Mutants that have come to Utobitha have left not soon after.
GID00006710	How strange! Why would anyone leave the safety and comfort that Utobitha provides?
GID00006711	Why, indeed. But now there's not a single first generation Super Mutant in Utobitha.
GID00006712	Except Neil.
GID00006713	Except Neil.
GID00006714	Well! I think we've all learned something today. Let's go to music!
GID00006715	You're listening to another edition of Know - Your - Mutants, with Best Friend Tabitha!
GID00006716	So, Best Friend Tabitha, who will we learn about today?
GID00006717	I guess it's time we talked the dumb-dumbs.
GID00006718	Oh, you mean the second generation Super Mutants who aren't so bright?
GID00006719	That's them. Dumb-dumbs... ah... that is... they...
GID00006720	They're very big. And strong.
GID00006721	Yes! They're just as big as other mutants, and as strong as they look. Beyond that, uh...
GID00006722	And there's a lot of them.
GID00006723	Oh yeah, dumb-dumbs are the most common type of mutant that most travelers will encounter, and make up more than half the mutants here in Utobitha.
GID00006724	Best Friend Tabitha, some of our listeners may wonder how you can call them dumb-dumbs on the air like this.
GID00006725	That's a good question, Rhonda. The truth is, they're so dumb they don't even know that I'm talking about them right now.
GID00006726	And that's another revealing look at mutantkind. Second generation Super Mutants. Big. Numerous. Dumb. More after this!
GID00006727	What do you think we should play next?
GID00006728	It doesn't matter, just grab something. And check on Raul while you're at it.
GID00006729	Raul! Why are you on the radio?
GID00006730	Uh, I don't know. Did you hit that switch I, ah, keep telling you not to press?
GID00006731	Sorry about that, Utobitha! Here's some music!
GID00006732	Utobitha, I'm here with Best Friend Tabitha, who has a message for all the dumb-dumbs out there.
GID00006733	It has come to my attention that some of you dumb-dumbs took me a little too seriously in the past when I warned you about the battle cattle.
GID00006734	While battle cattle are indeed a dangerous foe, they are one that should be fought ferociously.
GID00006735	Recently I've heard about several incidents where some of you have been seen running away from a fight where battle cattle were involved.
GID00006736	This is not acceptable. No self-respecting soldier of Utobitha should ever be seen running like a scared little human.
GID00006737	Bah, I don't even know why I try. It's not like the dumb-dumbs are even going to understand this.
GID00006738	You heard her, Utobitha! Beware the battle cattle, but don't *fear* the battle cattle. More after this!
GID00006739	You dared come here, after what you did?
GID00006740	What do you think you're going to do? Fight you way up to the penthouse and assassinate me?
GID00006741	You came here to finish what you think you started?
GID00006742	This is nothing compared to what's waiting for you up in the penthouse.
GID00006743	Vegas will still rise again. Your betrayal won't defeat me!
GID00006744	The Lucky 38 will be your grave. I'll finish what Benny couldn't get right!
GID00006745	Hold on, now, hold on. Just a moment...
GID00006746	Turn around and leave, and I'll... I won't attack you any further.
GID00006747	Just... stay away from the console. It doesn't do anything...
GID00006748	You've come back to kill me this time, I assume?
GID00006749	Ironic, how this turned out. The thousands of hours I spent calculating odds, running projections, planning for every contingency...
GID00006750	...only to be done in by a mail carrier with a grandiosity complex.
GID00006751	Get it over with, will you?
GID00006752	Aggressive acts on the casino premises will be met with lethal force. Vacate the premises immediately.
GID00006753	Vacate the premises immediately. The casino is off-limits for 24 hours.
GID00006754	Vacate the premises immediately. All Securitrons are at a state of high alert.
GID00006755	What of it? I enjoy them. There's something about a little diorama set inside a glass dome that I... find pleasing.
GID00006756	If you run across any out in the wastes, turn them in to Jane. She'll compensate you.
GID00006757	By my calculations, his death will affect the shape of the battle for Hoover Dam minimally, if at all.
GID00006758	The Legion's aggression will outlive Caesar. Indeed, they'll try to take the dam as a tribute to his memory.
GID00006759	Given a year, they'd have him deified - but by then the Legion will be breaking down, riven by internal conflicts, a monster consuming itself.
GID00006760	It's irrelevant. In the short term, the Legion is still monster enough that defeating it will make me look powerful indeed.
GID00006761	Hoover Dam, of course. A hydroelectric dam?
GID00006762	The NCR had it up and running at 50% capacity within a year of occupying the dam. By treaty, New Vegas receives 5% of its output - more than enough.
GID00006763	I recommend following the Securitron's instructions. Its programming is... strict, and I don't have time to change it.
GID00006764	Cannibalism was strictly forbidden in their contract. If some of them broke that stricture, they deserved whatever punishment you dealt them.
GID00006765	No, I was not aware of this.
GID00006766	Is it really so hard not to engage in cannibalism? My goodness...
GID00006767	It's a violation of their contract. I authorize you to deal with them in any way you see fit.
GID00006768	Yes, of course. But refraining from those "dietary practices" is a primary requirement of their contract.
GID00006769	They've been good to their word. Put together one hell of a resort hotel, too.
GID00006770	From what I hear, I'd want to eat at the Gourmand every night... if I were ambulatory.
GID00006771	Think you're doing well to have made it this far?
GID00006772	Your chances of breaking through my defenses, they're... minimal, at best!
GID00006773	Why are you doing this?
GID00006774	I would've made you wealthy! You could've helped change the world!
GID00006775	You're actually going to do this all over again?
GID00006776	Damn it, will you die already?
GID00006777	If personal gain... what you sought... should've done... as asked...
GID00006778	Fool... to let... personalities... derail future... of mankind? ...Stupid!
GID00006779	Those snakes? ...for them? ...you sad, misguided... whore.
GID00006780	Slavery... the future of... mankind? What... have you... done?
GID00006781	Your... vanity project... doomed to fail...
GID00006782	May there be... a hell... for you... a Tartarus... bleak, unending...
GID00006783	No! ...Don't disable... cerebral... I'd rather be... killed... just kill... me...
GID00006784	No... ruined everything... exposed... germs... a year of... life, if... at most...
GID00006785	The name's Old Ben. I've been living in Freeside since the day I was born.
GID00006786	Those bots are programmed to vaporize anyone who enters the fenced-in area without authorization from the greeter.
GID00006787	Your loss, my friend.
GID00006788	It is a dream come true. Santiago never thought he could work in such a wonderous den of vice and iniquity.
GID00006789	Goodbye.
GID00006790	I've heard stories of that old guy. I'm amazed he's still alive with how much he's been through.
GID00006791	If the stories are true, he'll be a valuable commodity here at the Wrangler. I appreciate the find.
GID00006792	Looks like that gives us a full roster of new ass to sell. Good work - enjoy the bonus.
GID00006793	I've heard stories of that old guy. I'm amazed he's still alive with how much he's been through.
GID00006794	If the stories are true, he'll be a valuable commodity here at the Wrangler. I appreciate the find.
GID00006795	Looks like that gives us a full roster of new ass to sell. Good work - enjoy the bonus.
GID00006796	I've heard stories of that old guy. I'm amazed he's still alive with how much he's been through.
GID00006797	If the stories are true, he'll be a valuable commodity here at the Wrangler. I appreciate the find.
GID00006798	I've heard stories of that old guy. I'm amazed he's still alive with how much he's been through.
GID00006799	If the stories are true, he'll be a valuable commodity here at the Wrangler. I appreciate the find.
GID00006800	The best place to start would be with Ralph at Mick & Ralph's over on the east end of Freeside. Other than that, your guess is as good as mine.
GID00006801	I've done a bit of everything around here - courier, butcher, crier, escort, gun for hire...
GID00006802	Some of which I'm not proud of, but I do my best to help around town when needed.
GID00006803	Goodbye.
GID00006804	I'm retired, but life has been a bit dull without some kind of action. What's the job?
GID00006805	Exactly one of the reasons I got out of that job. Too many shifty characters looking to have someone else move their hot items.
GID00006806	My father ran a butcher shop here in town, but business went downhill when another vendor started selling this strange meat at half of our prices.
GID00006807	You're telling me. Not long after my father's shop went under and he passed away from the loss, people around town started experiencing shakes.
GID00006808	No one gets shakes like that unless they're eating human flesh, but no one would believe me. The sick bastard gradually went insane and passed away.
GID00006809	Wasn't long before someone moved into the guy's place and found half-buried human remains in the crawlspace. I didn't bother saying told ya so.
GID00006810	After a while I made enough money to get a passport into Vegas. Back then you could get approved for entry for a fraction of what it costs now.
GID00006811	Well, I got a job working as a crier outside of The Tops advertising for the local talent performing at the casino. That didn't last long.
GID00006812	Well, being a suave young guy, I chatted up the ladies from time to time, and one of the managers' girls started to take a liking to me.
GID00006813	I never touched the woman, but the jealous prick decided it was my time to go. He framed me by saying I'd stolen from the casino.
GID00006814	Sure enough, a few grand was missing from the casino vault. I have to assume the bastard stole the funds and figured I was a convenient fall guy.
GID00006815	Yeah, but what can you do? I was stripped of my casino apartment and all of my belongings and booted back into Freeside.
GID00006816	From there I didn't have a lot of career options, as my rep was destroyed. So, the escort job sort of fell into my lap, no pun intended.
GID00006817	Yeah, shit indeed happens. I was stripped of my casino apartment and all of my belongings and booted back into Freeside.
GID00006818	From there I didn't have a lot of career options, as my rep was destroyed. So, the escort job sort of fell into my lap, no pun intended.
GID00006819	Well, I supposed you could look at it that way, but I was packing a whole different kind of heat. No, escort just sounds better than man-whore.
GID00006820	Yep. I was damn good at my job, too. But after a while I just felt like a piece of meat and had to quit.
GID00006821	Well, I didn't have any other career opportunities open to me at the time and had to make ends meet.
GID00006822	I was good at it too, but after a while I just felt like a piece of meat and had to quit.
GID00006823	When I quit the escort job, I had enough money to buy a pistol belt and some other gear.
GID00006824	Bodyguards make a good honest living, and I had the wits and physical build to handle most thugs.
GID00006825	After saving a few tourists from trouble, I got a reputation for being a stand-up guy again, and after a decade managed to save up enough to retire.
GID00006826	All right.
GID00006827	Ah, I get you. So you think because of my past escort work, I'd be interested in that kind of thing?
GID00006828	I got out of that work because it just made me feel empty inside. What makes you think I would ever go back to that degradation?
GID00006829	[SUCCEEDED] You know what? You're right. I looked at the whole thing from the wrong angle.
GID00006830	I suppose I could be a loving muse to some, while simply relieve stress and tension in others. Thanks for that insight.
GID00006831	Tell Garret I'd be happy to start at the Wrangler immediately. This should be a nice change of pace from retirement.
GID00006832	[FAILED] What do I look like? Arm candy? I don't think so, friend.
GID00006833	I never put much thought into the well-being my clients got out of my services. I suppose they only get as much as I put into it.
GID00006834	Tell Garret I'd be happy to start at the Wrangler immediately. This should be a nice change of pace from retirement.
GID00006835	I never put much thought into the well-being my clients got out of my services. I suppose they only get as much as I put into it.
GID00006836	Tell Garret I'd be happy to start at the Wrangler immediately. This should be a nice change of pace from retirement.
GID00006837	And... uh... well. These uh... these boys with you? Hello, there, smiley.
GID00006838	I would sooner spit on the grave of my dead mother than let some courier-walk-the-wasteland-fuck talk to me like that.
GID00006839	Who the hell do you think you are? Looking to cash your chips to the sound of NCR bullets, eh? I can oblige.
GID00006840	Look, I know you're riding high right now, but let me tell you - you ain't pissing on me right now, you're pissing on the Bear.
GID00006841	You been far enough West I'm guessing to know how far that claw stretches. Fuck with the Bear, and...
GID00006842	You want me to make tracks out of here, head back West, tail between our legs?
GID00006843	No, I came for a fight today, and if you're looking to make me budge, you better have a damn good left hook or I'm not going anywhere.
GID00006844	Do you know what you're doing? Making a nation - like you think you're doing, ain't like chowing down on a pile of Fancy Lad Snack Cakes.
GID00006845	Think you got the guts to carve out a frontier? Build towns, protect the roads, run supplies, train troops?
GID00006846	Hell. Can't believe we got suckered by a slip of a woman. Should've watched the flank while Caesar's best were making all that noise.
GID00006847	Hell. Can't believe we got suckered by some road jockey. Should've watched the flank while Caesar's best was making all that noise.
GID00006848	I know what those robots of yours can do on a bad day, and I'm not eager to toss lives at them just to make a point.
GID00006849	But if you're taking this place, you better hope you can hold it. I'll give my superiors my opinion, but I don't think they're going to listen.
GID00006850	So if NCR comes at you, and it will, pray you're ready. I promise you, our situations reversed, I'd see you hang.
GID00006851	Fine. Come on, men, we're moving out.
GID00006852	Vegas? What, the families? Or... House. You're talking about House.
GID00006853	What the hell are you on about? House? He's just a rumor on the Strip, never leaves his...
GID00006854	Gambling? What, you looking to start a game now that the smoke's died down-
GID00006855	You know I won't surrender the Dam, and certainly not to the ghost man of Vegas and his new right-hand-of-the-week.
GID00006856	We held this place for years, kicked one Legate out of here so hard Caesar burned him to a crisp. It's our post, we've fought for it.
GID00006857	I'll fight for it again today. If you're looking to convince me otherwise, you better have a lot more reasons than you just telling me to go.
GID00006858	Look, House... Vegas... it's pretty, got you blinded a bit maybe, but NCR's got perks, too. Think about it before you sign on with him.
GID00006859	And if you say "no," keep in mind what that means. NCR may have its problems, but when we're riled, watch out.
GID00006860	Many graves in the East are filled with those who said as much, with braver words, not backed by strength.
GID00006861	It is Caesar's will this gate to the West bear the flag of the Legion. Caesar's will shall be done.
GID00006862	I see you fight with words, like all beneath the flag of the bear. Let us hope your skill with weapons proves greater.
GID00006863	Caesar's will is made truth through me. I am a hammer against all that defy his rule.
GID00006864	If you seek to stand against me, you shall fall as the West falls.
GID00006865	Caesar's will is the will of the Legion. And the West... all beneath the flag of the Great Bear exist to test the strength of the Legion.
GID00006866	The West shall fall as the East fell, and all the tribes that stretch to the setting sun shall bear the mark of the Legion.
GID00006867	Enough words, then. Let our strength settle this.
GID00006868	We shall see how brave you are when nailed to the walls of Hoover Dam, your body facing West so you may watch your world die.
GID00006869	[SUCCEEDED] You dare speak that name? Comparing him to any man of Caesar will only earn you a slow death.
GID00006870	You think me some lesser man, some other Legate? I am the first of the Legion, and this gate to the West shall be ours this day.
GID00006871	[FAILED] Those are your final words? They are too weak to even wash the stain of your disgrace this day.
GID00006872	Yet if those are the words you wish to be remembered for, then I shall... *honor* them.
GID00006873	[SUCCEEDED] Hnh. You believe your own words, even if I do not.
GID00006874	Perhaps NCR has the strength of a cornered animal... it will not be enough to hold this place.
GID00006875	They know nothing of my tactics - or the strength of my forces. They will learn.
GID00006876	[FAILED] Then they know nothing of me or the Legion's subjugation of the East.
GID00006877	And to send you to deceive me... it is you that they have tricked, not I.
GID00006878	[SUCCEEDED] We did take the towers easier than expected. I cannot believe even the Republic would overlook such an opening in their defenses.
GID00006879	Yet we are at throat of the Great Bear. Victory is at hand.
GID00006880	[FAILED] I am not another Legate, and I am not such a fool as Graham, to be painted in pitch and set aflame.
GID00006881	If all NCR believes as you do, then this battle is already won.
GID00006882	[SUCCEEDED] You play on my instincts. Yet your intention in this... you have nothing to gain by telling me of this... "trap."
GID00006883	Unless you seek to goad me into a retreat, leaving the battlefield and leaving my honor here to be trampled underfoot by Republic cowards.
GID00006884	Of course. And I guard myself from such acts of cowardice and jealousy.
GID00006885	You claim that word of my coming has been given to the West so that I might die here... even as I take the Dam?
GID00006886	Telling me this does not benefit you at all... you gamble with your words, and your coin is lacking.
GID00006887	If what you say is true, then they shall answer for it.
GID00006888	But you suggest I turn from battle to answer these crimes, when I can prove myself greater by meeting them - then returning with the Dam as ours.
GID00006889	You almost convinced me otherwise... but justice comes to all in time, and it now comes to you.
GID00006890	You speak with conviction, and more importantly, with honor. And we secured a foothold on the Dam... easily, as you have said.
GID00006891	Graham's overconfidence forever branded him with fire, I will not follow his trail of fire into the depths of the Grand Canyon.
GID00006892	The Republic shall keep their Old World gate this day, I shall return East. When I return, I shall have all the armies of the Legion with me.
GID00006893	Then ask them. The battle draws near.
GID00006894	Perhaps it is unfortunate Vulpes was not here to hear your words... something tells me you would prove more than his match.
GID00006895	Perhaps it is fortunate Vulpes went to his death before this day... something tells me your words would have surpassed even his skills.
GID00006896	Until the day when our armies meet again, NCR - I shall wait for you on the battlefield.
GID00006897	Until the day when our armies meet again, envoy of Vegas - I shall wait for you on the battlefield.
GID00006898	Until the day when our armies meet again, courier - I shall wait for you on the battlefield.
GID00006899	[SUCCEEDED] Hnh. I have seen little of true battle this day. And you were brave to come here to face me when all of NCR would not.
GID00006900	I shall honor your last words and face you alone. No man will say I refused your challenge.
GID00006901	[SUCCEEDED] The West's treatment of bitches such as you is their weakness. But... by my honor, I shall face you alone, as you request.
GID00006902	Woman of the West... you will learn your place - in my tent, and again, when you beg for release on the edge of my blade.
GID00006903	[SUCCEEDED] I shall make a cape of your skin. And your skull - it shall sit by my side, mute, watching as my armies march West.
GID00006904	I shall honor your last words... and face you alone, as you request. No man will say I refused your challenge.
GID00006905	[SUCCEEDED] The West's treatment of bitches such as you is their weakness. But... by my honor, I shall face you alone, as you request.
GID00006906	Woman of the West... you will learn your place - in my tent, and again, when you beg for release on the edge of my blade.
GID00006907	[SUCCEEDED] I shall make a cape of your skin. And your skull - it shall sit by my side, mute, watching as my armies march West.
GID00006908	I shall honor your last words... and face you alone, as you request. No man will say I refused your challenge.
GID00006909	[FAILED] No, I shall make it a contest - whether I can kill you *before* my hounds tear you apart.
GID00006910	[SUCCEEDED] I have no *need* to hold it - anything the West sends against me shall break against the wall that is the Legion.
GID00006911	[FAILED] You seek to buy my conviction, like some merchant from the West.
GID00006912	[SUCCEEDED] You think we would march without a means of resupply? We have the Fort, we will have the Dam - other communities will fall.
GID00006913	And we shall harvest as we move West. We only need move forward.
GID00006914	[FAILED] Your reliance on comfort... it rots you from the inside. You are in need of the teachings the Legion will bring to your people.
GID00006915	[SUCCEEDED] There are many towns, many slaves... ripe for the taking as the tribes from the East were.
GID00006916	[FAILED] I shall carve your promises into your skin so that you might think on them - and let that be the lesson this day.
GID00006917	[SUCCEEDED] You rely too much on the trappings of... civilization. The people of the West were once tribes - they will relearn their ways, or...
GID00006918	[FAILED] Enough.
GID00006919	[SUCCEEDED] Vulpes... brought the touch of Caesar to such places.
GID00006920	It was necessary to weaken the West, show that the Legion could strike deep into the places where NCR thought it safe.
GID00006921	But we do not need *those* towns. Like Hoover Dam, there is the power within Vegas... we can harness it for our needs.
GID00006922	Hnh. Long ago... when taking Denver, I had to face such a challenge. Many died, over many years to claim the city as ours.
GID00006923	It was the lines of food and water that nearly broke the Legion's strength... and the lack of tribals near that cursed city.
GID00006924	What I felt in that struggle, I felt as I saw the map of the West. The West is a trap. The bear has already been caught in it, and it is dying.
GID00006925	[SUCCEEDED] Hnh. My coming would have saved you, set your people free in ways they cannot see.
GID00006926	War would have tested them. Broken the weak with its violence, yet allowing the strong to arise.
GID00006927	Violence gave you that strength, awakened you - I can see it upon your face, where two bullets left their mark.
GID00006928	[SUCCEEDED] Hnh. Then when I return, woman of the West... we shall see if your belief will withstand the blades of the Legion.
GID00006929	[SUCCEEDED] Hnh. Then when I return, man of the West... we shall see if your belief will withstand the blades of the Legion.
GID00006930	But I shall give you the time you need to prepare.
GID00006931	Retreat? Retreat.
GID00006932	I was a fool to listen to you... you know nothing of who I am.
GID00006933	[SUCCEEDED] So you seek quarter? Terms of surrender?
GID00006934	Our roads into NCR are hung with the bodies of those who attempted to negotiate with us.
GID00006935	Save your speeches, we will take Hoover Dam and move forward until our feet crush the setting sun beneath them.
GID00006936	[FAILED] It is the Legion that will surprise the West, but you will not be alive to see it.
GID00006937	[SUCCEEDED] Hoover Dam has never seen the massed strength of the East. Only Legates such as Graham... who deserved the fire Caesar blessed him with.
GID00006938	Now I am here, and make markers of your people as the Legion carves its way West.
GID00006939	[FAILED] Enough.
GID00006940	[SUCCEEDED] You speak in circles - what of the East? I am the East, and I will prove it this day.
GID00006941	[FAILED] Enough.
GID00006942	[SUCCEEDED] The victory here shall be swift. Our forces shall take the Dam, secure it, then build a road west on the bodies of the NCR.
GID00006943	The East will hold. Once across the Colorado, nothing to rival Hoover Dam remains.
GID00006944	[FAILED] Enough.
GID00006945	Vegas will fall.
GID00006946	[SUCCEEDED] Your weakness? You seek to thwart me by claiming the Legion is too strong for you?
GID00006947	[FAILED] And how battles are lost... when you bring nothing but words to a contest of strength.
GID00006948	I count on no one.
GID00006949	As was I... yet I was ordered to await you. Now that you are here, we may act.
GID00006950	A plan by Vulpes... treachery is a weapon that one should never rely on.
GID00006951	I can only hope that the Omertas died when their treachery was exposed, to have the plan succeed only would have sullied the Legion.
GID00006952	It does not matter, victory shall be ours, it shall be swift, and it will be honest, purchased with blood.
GID00006953	[SUCCEEDED] That does not mean we would not succeed.
GID00006954	[SUCCEEDED] The East was a hard-fought campaign. Even now, Caesar drew too much of the Legion's blood needed there for... this.
GID00006955	Hoover Dam is but a place. I will not have it be the gravestone of the Legion - whether quickly, or as you describe, slowly... by attrition.
GID00006956	As for wisdom... there is wisdom in your words, woman of the West.
GID00006957	As for wisdom... there is wisdom in your words, man of the West.
GID00006958	Know that I shall return East. I shall not remain there forever. On that day, the strength of the bear shall be tested.
GID00006959	If the West is one day filled with ones such as you, perhaps it shall be a worthy fight, indeed.
GID00006960	Then until our return... True to Caesar.
GID00006961	More like he's going to the Wrangler for another drink. You watch.
GID00006962	Good. Stick to the rules.
GID00006963	Hoo boy, Gloria's gonna have your ass for letting that wino in. You're not starting the day well, rookie.
GID00006964	He's clean.
GID00006965	She's clean.
GID00006966	Well, some of Mr. House's projections predict a "moderate probability of civil instability subsequent to the NCR being driven from the Vegas region."
GID00006967	One of the "mitigating contingencies" he planned was to enlist the Followers to provide increased medical aid throughout the region.
GID00006968	Just seems like it might help keep things stable when we go independent. Not that I know what I'm talking about!
GID00006969	Great! So I've been looking over Mr. House's force projections and running some calculations...
GID00006970	It turns out there are two ways we can win this thing! Hear that? We have options!
GID00006971	Great! So I've been looking over Mr. House's force projections and running some calculations...
GID00006972	It turns out there's only one way for us to win this battle and make it stick! We have to render Hoover Dam inoperable!
GID00006973	Great! I've been wanting to get a laser gun for a while now.
GID00006974	Sounds like a stupid policy to me.
GID00006975	Fine, I'm going, I'm going. And I'll take my business elsewhere!
GID00006976	Think I'll do just that.
GID00006977	New Vegas has many faces, stranger. Despite everything, it shall never be whole.
GID00006978	When the land hunts you, when fighting for survival is the norm, your neighbors become either saviors, or enemies.
GID00006979	Westside is a part of New Vegas, just as much as it's a part of the Wasteland. In the end, stranger, we need them both to continue making our fate.
GID00006980	Westside is a part of New Vegas, just as much as it's a part of the Wasteland. In the end, stranger, we need them both to continue making our fate.
GID00006981	Westside attracts all sorts of travelers, including merchants and farmers. They come here to exchange their goods, or to seek protection.
GID00006982	Our community provides enough food, clothes, weapons and medicine to encourage trade, and to arm our defenses.
GID00006983	The Thorn demonstrates, beyond anything else, that we're self-sufficient. Our desert-blood has overcome even the strongest beasts of the Wasteland.
GID00006984	The Thorn is my master, not the other way around. I live to make our kin able to transcend their limitations.
GID00006985	Our land is harsh, and hostile. Our lives are cheap, and fragile. Death is our assured fate, striking when least we expect it.
GID00006986	The Thorn awakens us to the truth. Here we escape from our bonds, and choose the moment of death against the will of destiny.
GID00006987	The land does not care about petty squabbles among lesser men. I don't care about that either.
GID00006988	In the end, the people of New Vegas will continue to live and die here. It matters not who their self-appointed "master" is.
GID00006989	Bold, as it pleases The Thorn, and me. But it does take more than that to earn my admiration.
GID00006990	You speak like a hunter, yet only actions prove one's worth. The Thorn requires a tribute of blood, and so do I.
GID00006991	You show great promise. I look forward to the time when I can call you "My Hunter," but that time has not yet arrived.
GID00006992	Your bravery surpasses that of any other, and I've come to admire your actions.
GID00006993	Before death takes us, I would know you deeper. Come with me... My Hunter.
GID00006994	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
GID00006995	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
GID00006996	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
GID00006997	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
GID00006998	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
GID00006999	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
GID00007000	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
GID00007001	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
GID00007002	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
GID00007003	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
GID00007004	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
GID00007005	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.

GID00007126	I can see your resolve, determined like the nature of a beast. So be it.
GID00007127	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
GID00007128	I've come to expect nothing less from you, brave stranger.
GID00007129	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
GID00007130	You liked it? Wow, you're the first one who ever did!
GID00007131	Psh. Whatever.
GID00007132	Hmm, indulgent, what rhymes with indulgent? Efful- no, no, that's terrible.
GID00007133	Silver... silver what? Silver eyes? No, "eyes" doesn't rhyme...
GID00007134	One, two, three... dammit, too many syllables!
GID00007135	There once was a man of stout heart... heart, heart, what rhymes with heart?
GID00007136	I wonder if anything rhymes with "Cazador?"
GID00007137	Hmm, maybe I should write something about how much the Great Khans suck.
GID00007138	How do you spell "gesticulate?"
GID00007139	If you are listening to this log from one of our Enclave Outposts in Chicago, give this unit whatever repairs it needs so it can continue to Navarro.
GID00007140	Take a look.
GID00007141	Then get out of here.
GID00007142	You did? Wow, that's great!
GID00007143	Once you get ahold of that Platinum Chip, I'll be able to help you in all sorts of ways.
GID00007144	Right, it's one of two locations on House's network with non-standard hardware.
GID00007145	My guess is that it has a reader that can decode the chip, and who knows what else? Maybe a giant robot or something!
GID00007146	That's right! Like I said, it's probably pretty important because it has non-standard hardware, just like the Lucky 38!
GID00007147	The data on that Platinum Chip is a big secret, unless you can find a dedicated reader to decode it. Isn't that frustrating?
GID00007148	Neat. Let me know what you find out!
GID00007149	I have to admire your prudent nature. Why get caught up in action, you know? And results?
GID00007150	Oh, yeah, I'm sure you're right. I mean, for one thing, it's you saying it, and you always know what you're talking about.
GID00007151	And if you had, you know, a huge killer robot at your command, yeah, that would just clutter things up.
GID00007152	And a lesser person might want that kind of overwhelming force on their side, but you know - where's the challenge in that?
GID00007153	Super! Now when Mr. House is out of the way, we can use the Chip to install me at the Lucky 38.
GID00007154	You have to get Mr. House out of the way, that's what! And then we'll install me on the Lucky 38's mainframe!
GID00007155	Watch your back out there.
GID00007156	Nope, not going to be that easy.
GID00007157	Download Complete. Begin Recording.
GID00007158	Navarro outpost scientists, I am glad that ED-E has reached you. You will find several databanks of information on this machine.
GID00007159	Please handle this information with the utmost care as it represents the sum total of the results of my research on the Duraframe Eyebots.
GID00007160	There are also several databanks with information on my research into Poseidon Energy and some projects they were working on in the Mojave area.
GID00007161	Yeah, beat it.
GID00007162	Guy's unstable, but he pays his rent and Sweetie seems to like him all right.
GID00007163	We can come to a deal. My price is firm, though - Saint James is a good customer and it better be worth it if I'm going to lose him.
GID00007164	I could never resist a woman like you. Here, take the key, but don't tell anyone where you go it.
GID00007165	Oh, don't you dare play that game with me. Fine, here's the key since it's so important to you. Just don't say where you got it.
GID00007166	Already forgotten!
GID00007167	And here's your key.
GID00007168	Too bad. No caps, no key.
GID00007169	That's all right. My friends got beat so bad they'll be recuperating for quite some time, so head over there when you can.
GID00007170	Near as I can tell, it was some sort of religious institution.
GID00007171	Oh, I know it says "school" out front, but everything in here seems to be related to the worship of some guy from back in the day.
GID00007172	People used to come here to learn about him, to dress like him, move like him. To be him. If that's not worship, I don't know what is.
GID00007173	Not a whole lot to tell. There were only a few books left in here when we found it, and those were rotted away.
GID00007174	There were some posters left that were pretty well preserved, which is how we know all this stuff was based on the same guy.
GID00007175	The thing of it is, we don't even know what his name was. All the posters just referred to him as "The King".
GID00007176	As far as we can tell, the guy that built this place was considered the coolest of the cool, and taught other people how to be more like him.
GID00007177	People would come from all around to learn how to sing, dance, dress, and even speak the way he did.
GID00007178	Sure thing. What'd you have in mind?
GID00007179	Well, that and the giant sign outside. This place could have been "The King's House of Dog Chow" and I still would have taken the name.
GID00007180	But I like to think I keep the memory alive.
GID00007181	Somethin' like that, yeah. There were some working tapes here when we first got here, so we know what he sounded like.
GID00007182	Sadly, they stopped working a few years back, so I sold them to a junk merchant who was passing through, otherwise I'd play some for you.
GID00007183	All the outfits you see my guy wearing around were originally found in here, too. Along with more hair gel than you can shake a stick at.
GID00007184	Rangers, this is the chief. I know I can ramble on sometimes, but I need you to listen close for the next minute or so. I've got some bad news.
GID00007185	I messed up. Made a mistake. I thought I could help get us out of here, but... it didn't work out.
GID00007186	Rangers get injured all the time. It's part of the job. But if you lose a few fingers, get a bad break, that's it. You step down.
GID00007187	We rely on each other too much to let our infirmities become a liability. A ranger knows when it's time. Only I didn't.
GID00007188	Somewhere along the way, something broke inside me. I couldn't find us a way out of this desert. I wrestled with it, and it took me down a dark road.
GID00007189	I wish I could explain it to you. The old chief's finally at a loss for words.
GID00007190	Send me all the Legion you can. I'll be waiting for them.
GID00007191	Hello.
GID00007192	Come over and introduce yourself.
GID00007193	Come now, don't keep me waiting.
GID00007194	I invited you here so we could talk, not so you can nose around.
GID00007195	Bye.
GID00007196	Uh... it's for the co-ops. Mr. Anderson told me to do it - he said it wasn't stealing if it's for the good of everybody.
GID00007197	He caught me and made me tell on Mr. Anderson. I don't know what happened after that, but when I asked, Mr. Anderson said not to worry.
GID00007198	But... Mr. Anderson had this look on his face. It's the look grownups get when they've done something bad.
GID00007199	[SUCCEEDED] I didn't want to get Mr. Anderson in trouble. He says the Westside needs to be able to take care of itself.
GID00007200	Corporal White caught me taking the water and made me tell on Mr. Anderson. I think something bad happened, but Mr. Anderson told me not to worry.
GID00007201	[FAILED] I said I don't know anything. Leave me alone!
GID00007202	I didn't want to get Mr. Anderson in trouble. He says the Westside needs to be able to take care of itself.
GID00007203	Corporal White caught me taking the water and made me tell on Mr. Anderson. I think something bad happened, but Mr. Anderson told me not to worry.
GID00007204	No. I gotta go.
GID00007205	Uh-huh.
GID00007206	My girl is trapped by geckos on the ridge and I can't get to her. Please, she's going to die!
GID00007207	I could pay you.
GID00007208	Fine, just leave me to my misery then.
GID00007209	Bastard. You're just like everyone else around here.
GID00007210	I hope someone helps my girl before it's too late.
GID00007211	I'll give you whatever you want, just hurry!
GID00007212	Go up the path past the broken radio tower and go to the right... they're at the top of the trail.
GID00007213	You will? Thank you for helping me. Please hurry.
GID00007214	But she'll die if you don't help!
GID00007215	You just gotta help her, man.
GID00007216	Since he's dead, I don't think he'll mind. Here.
GID00007217	I do have his spare key, but I'm not sure he'd like it if I let you in there. Saint James can be a little crazy sometimes.
GID00007218	I still don't think he'd like it if I let you in there.
GID00007219	Excellent! The Followers' mission will be better served with someone like yourself traveling around the Mojave.
GID00007220	As a representative of the Followers, I present you with your very own Lab Coat. Wear it well, and may it aid our cause.
GID00007221	Also, before I forget, here is a key to a safehouse you can use to rest if you happen to be in the area. I'll just mark it mark it on your map.
GID00007222	That is unfortunate. If you change your mind, please see me right away.
GID00007223	Our aim is to gradually shape a better brighter future for the wasteland.
GID00007224	We seek to heal the planet through efforts not unlike the medicine and education we offer here in the Old Mormon Fort.
GID00007225	All we ask is members and those seeking aid do their best to help those in need when the opportunity arises.
GID00007226	Take a look.
GID00007227	Great, did you change your mind?
GID00007228	I'm sure you have your reasons, but we are much too busy to waste our time on those selfish bastards.
GID00007229	Even if we wanted to, we don't have the resources to handle such a monumental task right now.
GID00007230	Unless you can handle our supply shortages, the best we can do is scrape by in here in Freeside.
GID00007231	Why should we support the NCR? Their continual operational incompetence gets their soldiers killed, and they hold a monopoly on water in the mojave.
GID00007232	I'm sure you have your reasons, but we are much too busy to waste our time on those selfish bastards.
GID00007233	Even if we wanted to, we don't have the resources to handle such a monumental task right now.
GID00007234	Unless you can handle our supply shortages, the best we can do is scrape by in here in Freeside.
GID00007235	Why should we support Vegas? They've locked Freeside out of the city and do nothing to help their neighboring townsfolk.
GID00007236	No, but there is still a good chance the NCR could hold them off and we're not equipped to fight a war, here.
GID00007237	Wow. Whatever you have planned must be pretty big to give them the boot, but this sounds dangerous.
GID00007238	I refuse to put my people at risk. If the NCR are pushed out, the raiders and other scum will run amok.
GID00007239	But the Followers aren't fighters. We'd get annihilated as front-line medics.
GID00007240	In that case, they'll have our support. We cannot afford to let the Legion win.
GID00007241	That is somewhat reassuring, but we still don't have the resources to care for the entire Mojave by ourselves.
GID00007242	We already experience regular supply shortages. Opening our door to the entire region... I don't see how this could ever work.
GID00007243	It is indeed our duty to teach and improve the living conditions of our fellow man, but we're talking an insane amount of logistics to make this work.
GID00007244	Surprisingly good. Our forces have managed to secure the region with little resistance, and trade should soon reach an all-time high.
GID00007245	The brass was particularly surprised by the lack of domestic threats in the area. They were prepared to spend months pacifying known troublemakers.
GID00007246	When they found those threats absent, they turned to the man in charge of the area, but Hsu being Hsu, he denied having anything to do with it.
GID00007247	So now the men have to answer to Brigadier General Moore, and both they and I have you to thank for it.
GID00007248	We made a good team. I hope we can work together again in the future.
GID00007249	I'm afraid I'm going to have to disappoint you. There's much to be done, but nothing for someone with your skills.
GID00007250	You should take some time off. You've earned it.
GID00007251	With their leader dead, the rest of their army retreated to the east. We've sent scouts to track them, but that's it.
GID00007252	We don't have the forces or supplies necessary to chase them down. More's the pity.
GID00007253	Still, I've sent a few skilled men out to make sure their journey is "eventful". It should be a long time before they even think of returning.
GID00007254	Of course, have they been dealt with?
GID00007255	Very well. Do you know what they're up to?
GID00007256	Okay. Is he still a threat?
GID00007257	Fine by me. Have you found them yet?
GID00007258	We aid some programs the Republic has sponsored involving sharecropper farms in the area, but those haven't panned out too well from what I hear.
GID00007259	There've been complaints about the amount of water we're supplying, but those are just excuses for lack of diligence, I'm sure.
GID00007260	We aid some programs the Republic has sponsored involving sharecropper farms in the area, which seem to be coming along nicely.
GID00007261	There was some sort of trouble involving the water supply recently, but it sorted itself out, as these things often do.
GID00007262	You have? Wow! That's amazing! You can murder Mr. House whenever you want!
GID00007263	Wow! Do you have any idea how special that is? Red carpet treatment!
GID00007264	Seems a little mean to use his invitation against him like that, but I'm sure it's all for the best!
GID00007265	It sounds like Mr. House is just plain mean. No wonder the good guys want to kill him and take his stuff!
GID00007266	If you've been inside the Lucky 38 before, I bet you can get in again! And that's amazing!
GID00007267	Isn't it exciting? I always wondered why I had missiles in my shoulders but couldn't launch them. Not that I'd ever want to!
GID00007268	The upgrade really boosts the hitting power of each Securitron! Now you just need a way of controlling them!
GID00007269	Really? An army of Securitrons - upgraded, no less? What a development!
GID00007270	An army like that should be enough to defend Vegas from - heck, anybody!
GID00007271	Let me know as soon as you have the Platinum Chip and Mr. House is out of the way!
GID00007272	I'll roll over to the Lucky 38 and see what I can do. If I'm right about the Platinum Chip, I should be able to install myself on House's mainframe!
GID00007273	Really? An army of Securitrons - upgraded, no less? What a development!
GID00007274	An army like that should be enough to defend Vegas from - I'm gonna say anybody!
GID00007275	I'd take it straight to Mr. House if I were you! He'll think you're helping him out! Then when he's not looking - KER-POW!
GID00007276	The big question is whether to give him the Chip before you do him in! He's the one who'll know exactly what to do with it, after all!
GID00007277	He might upgrade his defensive capabilities right away! Or even unlock new ones!
GID00007278	But then those defensive upgrades might make it harder for you to finish him off! Hard to say! It's up to you!
GID00007279	It looks like you'll have to fight your way inside the Lucky 38 and take care of Mr. house with your own two hands! Or weapons held in them!
GID00007280	You already took care of House, so when you get the Chip, all you have to do is let me know.
GID00007281	I'll roll over to the Lucky 38 and see what I can do. If I'm right about the Platinum Chip, I should be able to install myself on House's mainframe!
GID00007282	Let me know when it's done and I'll roll over to the Lucky 38. If I'm right about the Chip, I should be able to install myself on House's mainframe!
GID00007283	This is going to be great! I'm going to help you accomplish so much, whether I want to or not!
GID00007284	Of course you do! Sorry about that! And it's wonderful that you do!
GID00007285	Benny carries it with him at all times. I think he's paranoid that someone might want to take it from him.
GID00007286	No kidding! He was running fast! He better pace himself - he has to run all the way to Fortification Hill!
GID00007287	There's an underground facility there that might have the special hardware required to use the data on the Platinum Chip!
GID00007288	It's too bad Caesar's Legion built its camp right above it. Talk about inconvenient!
GID00007289	Hmm. You should probably check on that, huh?
GID00007290	I hope that didn't sound condscending. I didn't mean to be!
GID00007291	Well, that's just mean! I don't like Mr. House one bit! No wonder the good guys want to kill him and take his stuff!
GID00007292	You should accept his invitation and then murder him when he least suspects it!
GID00007293	You... blew it up? It's just funny, because that... army... seems like the secret weapon that was the whole point of... you know?
GID00007294	I really admire how you stack the odds against yourself! Yeah, make things challenging!
GID00007295	It's great. Really. Yeah. So anyway...
GID00007296	You won't find better.
GID00007297	Remember, an impressive gratuity sends a message.
GID00007298	Our drinks have many subtle flavors.
GID00007299	Eyebot Duraframe Subject E is both the prototype, and the last functional model in this test group.
GID00007300	I was prepared to make several significant upgrades to the machines.
GID00007301	However, as the project was canceled and all Duraframe assets are being diverted to Hellfire Armor, I am sending this model to the Navarro outpost.
GID00007302	<makes beeping sounds>
GID00007303	Subject E: Diagnosis complete. Begin Recording.
GID00007304	My name is Whitley. I'm a researcher at Adams Air Force base. Until recently I was in charge of the Duraframe reinforcement project for the combat model Eyebots.
GID00007305	Shoot.
GID00007306	Adios.
GID00007307	Well, now, there's an interesting idea - do a bit of good before we're all dead and forgotten. You can count me in.
GID00007308	Oh, and in case Arcade forgot to mention it, there's a five-word pass phrase needed to get into the bunker. My word is "old" - appropriate, huh?
GID00007309	Yeah, the NCR and the Legion are about due for another dustup. So, you're going to get yourself involved in that? All right, I'm in. Could be fun.
GID00007310	Hey, I was just asking. No need to get uppity about it. I'll be at the reunion, don't you worry.
GID00007311	Okay! Anything else?
GID00007312	I have my little helpers out and about, always looking for fresh things to add to the stewpot.
GID00007313	You may have seen them around somewhere yourself. Now, deny your hunger no longer!
GID00007314	For the right caps I might be able to put in a good word or let people know you're not such a bad guy. What do you have in mind?
GID00007315	All right, you let your caps do the talking. How much exactly are you looking for the locals to forget?
GID00007316	Sorry, bub, but I'm fresh out of ideas. I've done all I can to scrub up your rep around here. What's done is done.
GID00007317	All right, I can chat you up, but it is going to cost you. I'm not risking my reputation around here for nothing.
GID00007318	Sorry, chum, but I've done all I can to chat you up to the locals.
GID00007319	What do you need, then?
GID00007320	Very well, I'll let the townsfolk know you had your reasons, and convince them they were of the most benevolent means.
GID00007321	Okay, I'll reassure the townies your intentions are good, but if you keep it up, they aren't going to believe me in the future.
GID00007322	You've got yourself a deal. I'll let the townsfolk know some ill-tempered goon has been spreading nasty rumors about you.
GID00007323	All right, but this is the last time I can use this line with the townies. I can only discredit so many people.
GID00007324	This'll take some work, but I'm sure I can convince them you were off your rocker in the past and you've changed your ways.
GID00007325	However, this is a once-only affair. Screw me once, shame on you, and all that jazz.
GID00007326	People aren't going to believe me if you go on another spree and claim the Devil made you do it.
GID00007327	Great, I'll let the townsfolk know you help old ladies across the street and do your best to keep the town clean if you notice litter.
GID00007328	Okay, I'll tell the locals you've been keeping an eye on local thugs as a sort of neighborhood watch.
GID00007329	I'll see what I can do, but there isn't much more I can say about you that won't require more caps.
GID00007330	That'll do nicely. I'll spin some stories about how you stopped a mugging or two and saved a kid's pet rat from certain doom!
GID00007331	Thanks, I'll spin up some tales of you slaying some nasty critters infesting some of the local homes and donating the leftovers to charity.
GID00007332	Okay, but this is the last story I can tell without a bigger risk to my rep.
GID00007333	I'll tell them you took out a band of NCR raiders planning to rob locals as they left Freeside.
GID00007334	That'll do nicely. I'll spin some stories about how you stopped a mugging or two and saved a kid's pet rat from certain doom!
GID00007335	Thanks, I'll spin up some tales of you slaying some nasty critters infesting some of the local homes and donating the leftovers to charity.
GID00007336	Okay, but this is the last story I can tell without a bigger risk to my rep.
GID00007337	I'll tell them you took out a band of NCR raiders planning to rob locals as they left Freeside.
GID00007338	Great, this is going to require an epic tale of heroism...
GID00007339	I've got it! I'll say you slew a nest of Deathclaws living in the sewers! It was bloody work, but you waded through the pack like a man possessed!
GID00007340	Just to make this clear, I can only spin a whopper this big once. There's only so much people will believe before they see through the bullshit.
GID00007341	Suit yourself.
GID00007342	Done.
GID00007343	Done.
GID00007344	Goodbye.
GID00007345	I don't have time to discuss all the different aspects of the NCR with you, but if you want it all in a nutshell - the NCR is progress.
GID00007346	If you wander around the wasteland you'll find all sorts of tribes, villages, and such where people spend most of their time trying to survive.
GID00007347	The NCR gives its citizens a shot at something more. We have laws, currency, health care, government. All the things that were lost.
GID00007348	It's not perfect, but it's worth protecting, which is why we also have the largest military in existence.
GID00007349	I joined up at a young age. Was barely sixteen when I left home and volunteered to be in the military.
GID00007350	Got a few strange looks at first, but those stopped when I got top marks across the board during training, and became an officer at seventeen.
GID00007351	A few years went by, my squad helped take down gangs of raiders here and there, and one day an invitation to join the Rangers arrived.
GID00007352	Those were the best years of my life. Doing something that truly matters, and having the freedom to handle it as you see fit. Then I got injured.
GID00007353	Everyone was very supportive. I received a promotion to colonel and given greater responsibility, but my days as a Ranger were over.
GID00007354	It's of immense strategic value to the NCR. Hoover Dam sends enough electricity west to light every city and major settlement.
GID00007355	It's moderately defensible, with a single point of entry on the east side. To get to the power plants below, the enemy has to cross the entire top.
GID00007356	The Legion's tried to cross the water on a few occasions, but slow-moving boats make easy targets for sharpshooters.
GID00007357	They're organized, I'll give them that. The few times I've encountered them firsthand, I've been impressed with their discipline.
GID00007358	I've heard they don't allow women in their military, considering them nothing more than breeding stock.
GID00007359	Their men, however, are typically quite large, in phenomenal condition, and prefer close-quarter weapons.
GID00007360	Recent engagements have taught us to fear their shock attacks, so it's a blessing that we seem to have superior firearms.
GID00007361	I command the garrison here at the dam, yes, but Colonel Hsu over at McCarran is technically in charge of the area's forces.
GID00007362	I do, sometimes. There are days I'd give anything to out in the open air, planting explosives and laying down covering fire.
GID00007363	But here I am, stuck in the same stale office day after day, while other people get to do the actual fighting.
GID00007364	But enough reminiscing. Did you have other questions?
GID00007365	Oh, it has its perks, to be sure. I'm free to see that things on a large scale are done my way, and don't have to tolerate any disagreement.
GID00007366	Those few people in a position to countermand my orders only care about results, and in that regard I never leave them less than pleased.
GID00007367	I can only spare a few more moments. What did you wish to speak about?
GID00007368	I've never once seen a single one of them back down, or disobey an order.
GID00007369	They'll happily charge a fortified position with little more than a sharpened stick if ordered to, and do so without hesitation.
GID00007370	Yes, extremely so. They must use conditioning routines on par with the rangers, or better.
GID00007371	Their soldiers can run near half again as fast as my best men, and close distances with frightening speed. And they're as strong as they are fast.
GID00007372	Their superior physicality makes them extremely dangerous up close, so I've had the men run drills for taking on larger, stronger opponents.
GID00007373	But they've all been instructed to take them down at range, if possible. I've made it clear I don't want any heroes in my squad, just survivors.
GID00007374	Their standard kit seems to be a blade of some sort and light armor. Guns are not uncommon, but are of questionable condition.
GID00007375	While they prefer to use their blades, it's common for them to scavenge better weapons from their enemies and use those.
GID00007376	The men have been told to toss their weapons over the side of the dam if they receive a fatal wound, but I doubt many will remember.
GID00007377	As I said, our scouts were some ways west of HELIOS when they disappeared.
GID00007378	Don't fool yourself. I've dealt with enough of these gangs to know that they can't be trusted. Was there anything else?
GID00007379	Very well, but be brief.
GID00007380	To name a few things off the top of my head - expand his borders, get the NCR and Legion to wipe each other out, and seize Hoover Dam.
GID00007381	Any other questions?
GID00007382	We've had reported sightings of Mr. House's Securitrons spying on both NCR and Legion forces.
GID00007383	Also, given a recent analysis of the sightings, we now estimate that Mr. House has at least four times as many securitrons as previously assumed.
GID00007384	He wouldn't show his hand like that if he weren't prepared to move. And neither the NCR or Legion can spare the troops to investigate.
GID00007385	Which is why I'm sending you. Any other questions?
GID00007386	Perhaps, but that's not my problem. Vegas is a nice place for the men to go on vacation, but it'd be an acceptable loss next to the Dam.
GID00007387	Good, then you have your orders. See that Mr. House does not present a problem.
GID00007388	Dismissed.
GID00007389	Damn it all to hell! Let's go!
GID00007390	Our instructions were pretty clear. Now you better get your ass out of here.
GID00007391	Friend or not, no one is allowed in here. Move along!
GID00007392	All right, but make it quick.
GID00007393	It's probably more important that you get out of here alive. If you haven't noticed, there's a battle going on here.
GID00007394	Now get out of here!
GID00007395	You'll regret this!
GID00007396	It took years for Caesar to conquer Lanius' tribe, and Caesar showed mercy to the survivors, allowing them to join the Legion.
GID00007397	Had the positions been reversed, Caesar would be dead. Lanius is called the Monster of the East because he never, ever shows mercy.
GID00007398	He's a story to frighten the younger Legionaries. He's dead - no man, no matter how tough, could survive a fall into the Grand Canyon.
GID00007399	His head exploded, idiot. Of course it's your fault. Avenge Caesar!
GID00007400	A vengeful spirit, some of the more superstitious women claim. He was a great leader of the Legion before he failed Caesar.
GID00007401	The story says he was set on fire and thrown into the Grand Canyon, but his angry spirit rose from the ashes of his corpse, looking for revenge.
GID00007402	Nonsense, probably, but there's no doubt that many in the Legion believe he's still alive somehow.
GID00007403	The Legate is not a man to be crossed, especially if you're a woman. That's all I will say about it.
GID00007404	Stop right there, no one is allowed into the control room!
GID00007405	I warned you!
GID00007406	We are here as promised. Now let's kick some ass.
GID00007407	See ya soon!
GID00007408	The Boss is pretty clear on this. I can't let you in unless you're by your lonesome.
GID00007409	Oh boy.
GID00007410	Come back soon, now!
GID00007411	The old guy is now in a coma.
GID00007412	Done.
GID00007413	Folks around here call me the chief, but Hanlon's just fine. The rangers run themselves pretty well, but I try to lend a hand.
GID00007414	Mostly administrative work, helping coordinate intel on the radio. That and keeping an eye on the fires growing across the water.
GID00007415	The best of the best, worst of the worst. He came out of NCR, one of the Followers of the Apocalypse.
GID00007416	Like a lot of the Followers, he went out in the wilderness with a partner to try to help those who needed helping.
GID00007417	Not much different from how the rangers used to be, except with books and medicine instead of guns.
GID00007418	It's no secret that we've had better campaigns. Holding this whole length of river isn't easy.
GID00007419	We're stretched thin and the Long 15 just keeps getting longer. Slow to get supplies. Slower to get reinforcements.
GID00007420	NCR's senate has got funds tied up at the Boneyard and President Kimball ordered our most experienced rangers to chase ghosts down in Baja.
GID00007421	Even Caesar knows that General Oliver's coming back to Hoover. Colonel Moore's doing a fine job of running things over at the dam.
GID00007422	In her own way, of course, when she's not trying to wrangle my rangers into helping her.
GID00007423	But just keeping that dam secure and operational day to day is enough work for one person, never mind building a defense against the Legion.
GID00007424	Mojave Outpost sent word through the stations. The rangers coming up from Baja moved through Dayglow a week ago.
GID00007425	Some of the patrol rangers have reported that Oliver's power armor heavy troopers are starting to reinforce the front lines.
GID00007426	Wish they got here a bit earlier, but that's the senate for you.
GID00007427	Not too long ago, they took Nelson and Searchlight.
GID00007428	They've got some camps on the eastern shore of the Colorado, and the monstrosity on the hill across the lake - that's for Caesar.
GID00007429	Some folks don't believe he's here yet, but you can tell. He's the eye of the storm. It all roils and spins around him.
GID00007430	You don't have to see the man to see the effect he has.
GID00007431	Intel says the legate's coming. Lanius. They call him the Monster of the East. If he's half as bad as Graham was, we're in for a heck of a fight.
GID00007432	With Caesar and a new legate here, the Legion's not going to fall for the same old bag of tricks.
GID00007433	Word is that the Legion's old timers have shown up, Caesar's veterans from the Red Okie Centuria and what was the Painted Rock tribe.
GID00007434	They're the best of the best and the baddest of the bad. Short of a centurion or praetorian, they don't come any tougher.
GID00007435	You come across a pack of them, weigh your options carefully.
GID00007436	I could tell you a lot if you had the time, but at my age I'm not sure which of us would get tired first. What do you want to know?
GID00007437	I didn't realize you were in such a hurry.
GID00007438	I get so used to sitting in this chair and listening to radio reports, sometimes I forget people are getting ready for a war out there.
GID00007439	Interesting that she would wrangle someone else into sorting out the problem.
GID00007440	But I suppose you're in the right place. A lot of intel comes through here.
GID00007441	This again? All right. What do you want to know?
GID00007442	Hold on. If we're going to have this conversation, let's go somewhere more private.
GID00007443	Don't worry. Not much bite left in this old dog.
GID00007444	I don't know Technical Sergeant Reyes, but coordinating intel can be messy sometimes. Things get mixed up, people get confused.
GID00007445	Heck, I get confused and I've been doing this for a long time now. What he - or she - sees as a problem might be standard operating procedure.
GID00007446	That's not to say Reyes is wrong for being concerned, but it's easy for the sand to get in your eyes out here.
GID00007447	Well... the logical thing to do is to check with the patrol rangers and comm officers. Don't be too discouraged if some things don't match up.
GID00007448	Different people see different things, and sometimes the meaning gets twisted, lost in static from person to person.
GID00007449	It's a simple system, when it works. Patrol rangers radio intel to ranger stations.
GID00007450	Comm rangers send the intel up the station chain until it reaches Camp Golf.
GID00007451	Then I or one of the other rangers on duty organize the data, evaluate it, and send information to camps or troopers in the field.
GID00007452	Comm rangers might have an incomplete picture of the situation. There's a lot going on out there.
GID00007453	Intel needs to be coordinated through Golf so we can verify and advise appropriately.
GID00007454	Troopers have enough to deal with. We don't want them questioning their intel.
GID00007455	You have, have you? Misdirection. When you're pinned down, outnumbered, and two days from any help, it's just about the best friend you can have.
GID00007456	Misdirection's what's saved me all these years. It's what saved us at Hoover Dam. But it's been five years now and Caesar's right across that lake.
GID00007457	He's closer now than he ever was before. I was a young man once. I know what it's like to want to fight for your home, but this isn't it.
GID00007458	It's never going to end. This fight with Caesar. People back home don't know what these young men and women are in for.
GID00007459	The Legion is the worst enemy we've ever faced, but we can't stop Caesar here, not without getting a lot of good people killed.
GID00007460	More than anyone cares to count up. And even if we do stop him, I don't see how we're ever going to be able to pull out.
GID00007461	We're fighting on their behalf, but Mr. House and the families are stringing us up, inch by inch.
GID00007462	They'll drain us dry while we fight and die over this dam. We offered them sanctuary in NCR territory before, but they won't listen.
GID00007463	Troopers and rangers have been dying here for more than five years while the families sit pretty behind that... damned wall.
GID00007464	People back home don't listen. They don't care. Senators, Brahmin barons, folks who are just trying to make it from day to day.
GID00007465	It's been so many years that people forget about it. Conscription brings in fresh troops to die here every month. Like it's routine.
GID00007466	And even if we hold this dam, what then? Are we going to send the NCR's men and women to die here for another five years? Ten?
GID00007467	Patrol the whole length of the Colorado for hundreds of miles? Holding this dam. It'll be the death of us.
GID00007468	First thing that comes to mind is to turn me in. But that might not be the best play, all things considered.
GID00007469	Even if your heart's in the right place, I reckon it might do a lot more harm than good.
GID00007470	Hold on. This is ranger headquarters. There might be a dozen rangers within earshot.
GID00007471	Think twice before you decide to give the old chief a gut full of lead.
GID00007472	Creating fear and instability among the troopers without causing harm, it's the only thing I could think of to shake things up.
GID00007473	It took some people getting killed to realize I had gone too far. I had to stop.
GID00007474	Fair enough. You want to do this the right way, go get one of the rangers. Don't worry. I'm not gonna run out on you.
GID00007475	Oliver can't stand that rangers got credit for victory at Hoover. Whatever I recommend, he does the opposite. I said I wanted them on the ridge.
GID00007476	He put them right on the western part of the dam itself. We don't have enough firepower to hold that spot.
GID00007477	If the troopers fall back, and they will, the rangers will advance to cover Oliver's retreat. We lose the dam, Oliver and the senate are ruined.
GID00007478	Rangers are volunteers. Every man and woman who signs up is willing to die for the NCR, myself included.
GID00007479	A lot of this is my fault. It's only right that I stand with them.
GID00007480	Maybe fifty rangers will die on that dam. We lose over a thousand troopers every year. Being here is crazy. Getting out's the only sane thing to do.
GID00007481	It's a gamble either way. Even with Caesar gone, we still might not outlast the Legion. I suppose that's a risk I'll have to take.
GID00007482	For our sake, I hope you're right. I guess I should thank you for bringing me to my senses. So... thanks.
GID00007483	Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to walk out that door and pretend we never had this talk.
GID00007484	The Legion is more than just Caesar! It's got the momentum of thousands of men behind it.
GID00007485	They're not just going to roll off into Arizona if we give them a good shove.
GID00007486	I don't know if you're working for Caesar or if desperation's made me a heck of a lot more persuasive. Either way, this is the right thing to do.
GID00007487	Now, I trust we're done discussing this. I'm going to step through that door and pretend like we never had this talk.
GID00007488	Well, you got that right.
GID00007489	Legion fires. They burn high wherever the Legion goes.
GID00007490	Caesar's a hard man to figure out, but he always wants you to know when more troops are at your front door.
GID00007491	Out to the Grand Canyon. He met a missionary from Utah, a man by the name of Joshua Graham. Graham helped translate for the Followers and the tribes.
GID00007492	All three of them got nabbed by the Blackfoots down there, back when they were still at war with every other tribe in the southwest.
GID00007493	Somewhere along the way, he realized he needed to educate the Blackfoots or they were going to get wiped out with the rest of the tribe.
GID00007494	Showed them how to use guns, how to make explosives. Once he taught the Blackfoots a thing or two, they needed him.
GID00007495	And he no longer needed the Followers, NCR, or anyone else. He decided he could remake the tribes of the southwest, whether they wanted it or not.
GID00007496	He became Caesar and Joshua Graham became his legate, his right hand. And that's where Graham stayed until Hoover Dam.
GID00007497	Losing the dam was the worst defeat the Legion ever suffered. Graham had been with Caesar since the beginning, but he had to set an example.
GID00007498	The praetorians covered Graham in pitch, lit him on fire, and down into the Grand Canyon he went.
GID00007499	Yes and no. The Blackfoots don't exist anymore, just like any other tribe that gets swallowed by the Legion.
GID00007500	Caesar takes the tribal out of the tribe. Scrapes and burns off tattoos, breaks up families, forces mixed breeding so all the old loyalties die away.
GID00007501	The only tribe in the Legion is the Legion. Caesar is their chief, father, and god all rolled into one.
GID00007502	It's not that clear cut. You have to understand, Graham was the toughest son of a gun anyone around these parts had ever seen.
GID00007503	Before Hoover, we had five kill reports on Graham from rangers and 1st Recon sharpshooters who tried to take him out.
GID00007504	Some folks think he's still alive, call him the Burned Man.
GID00007505	Senate elections are coming up. Local representatives don't want to push any more funding to the Mojave campaign because it's unpopular.
GID00007506	Most of the folks around the Boneyard haven't been to New Vegas and probably never will.
GID00007507	All they know is that their money gets sucked away to this desert and their brothers, sisters, sons, and daughters die here.
GID00007508	It's complicated. Goes way back. I told President Kimball that we need more rangers here.
GID00007509	He accepted that, but took the most experienced ones and sent them south. Patrol rangers are good men and women, but we're about to fight a war.
GID00007510	You've seen it yourself. Some of them don't even have proper service rifles or armor.
GID00007511	Our heavy infantry, power armor units, they're back in NCR territory protecting the interests of Brahmin barons against small-time raiders.
GID00007512	Brahmin barons only have one vote at the ballot box, but they have a lot of money to throw around.
GID00007513	Oh, well... now, you'll have to excuse me. The general and I don't always see eye to eye on things.
GID00007514	Maybe it's best that I just say that he is a trooper, through and through. The man will not give up an inch for anything, least of all to the Legion.
GID00007515	The colonel is an effective commander - one of the best - but she sharpened her claws on the Vipers and the old Jackals.
GID00007516	Did four tours against the Brotherhood, too. She used to be ranger until an injury took her out of action. Happens to a lot of us, unfortunately.
GID00007517	She's better at making graves than making friends. Bring in Moore and the earth will be razed. Fields will be salted.
GID00007518	No, and thanks to General Oliver for that. Colonel Hsu is at McCarran. Most of the New Vegas troopers are under his command.
GID00007519	He's more sympathetic to the locals than Moore, but he's got the Fiends to deal with.
GID00007520	No, and thanks to General Oliver for that. Colonel Hsu is at McCarran. Most of the New Vegas troopers are under his command.
GID00007521	He's more sympathetic to the locals than Moore. Now that the Fiends aren't giving him grief, we should see more troopers assigned to the front lines.
GID00007522	Good work on that, by the way. Hope you got good bounties out of it.
GID00007523	The Baja rangers can do more advance night scouting and sharpshooting to assist the troopers.
GID00007524	Ranger combat helmets are old Pre-War gear. They have built in low-light optics. Makes a big difference.
GID00007525	They have the best equipment the NCR can get its hands on, power armor salvaged from our war with the Brotherhood.
GID00007526	Techs strip out the joint servos so you don't need special training to wear it.
GID00007527	It feels like you're carrying a Brahmin on your back, but it can take a heck of a lot of punishment.
GID00007528	Nelson was barely set up. We had a big stretch of unprotected land between Forlorn Hope and Searchlight, and Nelson was the solution.
GID00007529	A decanus named Dead Sea took the place and caused a lot of damage.
GID00007530	Searchlight was worse. One of Caesar's frumentarii must have found something in there, flooded the whole camp with radiation.
GID00007531	By the way, I appreciate what you did for the troopers down there.
GID00007532	Nelson might not be the most strategically important place, but taking Dead Sea out means a lot to them.
GID00007533	I can't say I think the legionaries at Cottonwood deserved the same fate, but what's done is done.
GID00007534	Thanks to you, that's one less pack of slavers for people to worry about.
GID00007535	Oh, the usual reasons. People say he's enormous, carries a big sword, chops peoples' heads off. That's not what makes him a good commander, though.
GID00007536	Folks say he came from a heck of a tough tribe, took Caesar a long time to conquer. It was thanks to Lanius.
GID00007537	But once Caesar broke him, he was born again. He'll go anywhere and do anything to win. Legion says he can smell weakness.
GID00007538	Once he finds out where an army's vulnerable, he'll go to it like a dog for the throat.
GID00007539	He was a missionary from Utah who hooked up with Caesar at the Grand Canyon, became his translator.
GID00007540	Graham helped Caesar with the Blackfoots after they got captured together. Up until Hoover Dam, he was Caesar's legate.
GID00007541	You wouldn't think a man of god could turn so brutal. Cruel to his opponents. Did the sort of things that make you sick to talk about.
GID00007542	He wasn't a brilliant strategist. Wasn't tactically flexible, either. There was something about him, though. Menace, indestructibility.
GID00007543	It made everyone afraid of him. Heck, the praetorians burned Graham four years ago and some of the tribes are still afraid of him.
GID00007544	They say the Burned Man still walks the land, blackens the earth wherever he sets foot.
GID00007545	Take a regular legionary and age him ten years. Whatever they lose to age they make up for with experience. Life expectancy isn't long in the Legion.
GID00007546	You live ten years in Caesar's army, you're a force to be reckoned with.
GID00007547	There's no real equivalent to them in the NCR. Centurions are battle-born, elite officers who earned their rank with blood and sweat.
GID00007548	They wear special outfits, too, pieced together from the armor of all their defeated enemies. Good commanders, tough opponents.
GID00007549	Caesar's elite guard. They travel with him wherever he goes. A bit of insurance in case any of his guests get funny ideas.
GID00007550	They aren't the toughest legionaries, but they're the most devoted to Caesar. They believe in everything the Legion stands for.
GID00007551	Suppose it depends on what you think is "good." Most folks want to hear about Hoover Dam and Boulder City, but it's a long story.
GID00007552	If you want some tall tales about hunting down slavers or busting up gangs, talk to one of the younger rangers.
GID00007553	Oh, well. I guess it must be coming up on... forty years or so. Back before Elise was chief, anyway. It was a heck of a lot harder then.
GID00007554	Weren't as many of us to go around. But I think it was a lot easier to tell the good guys from the bad.
GID00007555	Well, there's what we're supposed to be doing and what we're actually doing.
GID00007556	There's a big gap between those two things, about as wide as that lake out there.
GID00007557	There's a lot of answers to that question, but it started with the Ranger Unification Treaty. We weren't always the only show in town.
GID00007558	Nevada had its own posse, the Desert Rangers. They fought Caesar even farther east, out in Arizona. Didn't go well for them.
GID00007559	Years back, we met with the Desert Rangers at Mojave Outpost and agreed to help them against Caesar if they would join the NCR.
GID00007560	"To protect against all forms of tyranny." As simple as that. Thirty, forty years ago, the wasteland was full of despots.
GID00007561	Slavers. Raiders. Tough-talking hoodlums with gangs who liked to kick around towns. Back then the NCR military was still young.
GID00007562	Couldn't cover much ground. It took groups like ours to tip the balance back to the good guys.
GID00007563	Sitting on the shore of Lake Mead, looking east. Listening to a radio. Trying to not get too many people killed.
GID00007564	I'm too old to be slapping leather, but I had hoped for something else. More than this, anyway.
GID00007565	[SUCCEEDED] It's kind of a long one, but all right. About twenty, twenty-five years ago, a group of NCR settlers pushed way south into Baja.
GID00007566	I guess it doesn't seem so far now if you look at a map, but back then, they were out a ways.
GID00007567	They built this little shanty town around a well in the middle of nowhere. Called it Rattletail.
GID00007568	[FAILED] I do, but I'm tired of telling them. Time changes how you look at things.
GID00007569	In big battles, Caesar deploys his legionaries in waves. Recruits up front, prime soldiers behind the recruits, old guard bringing up the rear.
GID00007570	Opponents wear themselves out dealing with the first two waves, if they survive that long. When the veterans step up, there's not much fight left.
GID00007571	Caesar can adapt, though, and when required, he can run any mix of legionaries as skirmishers and still retain order in the ranks.
GID00007572	Word got back to one of our stations that raiders had been attacking the place. I went out with six rangers.
GID00007573	We must have been on the trail for a week before we got to Rattletail. We lost one woman to Night Stalkers and another almost died of dehydration.
GID00007574	When we reach the place, it's six shacks set up around an old well.
GID00007575	There's over two dozen bodies lying in the dunes way outside of town and five men with .308 rifles crouched behind sand bags.
GID00007576	And these bodies, these people out in the sand, they aren't raiders. Aren't even heavily armed.
GID00007577	They're just people who were trying to get to the only well in fifty miles. I didn't have to talk to the men to see that they did not care one bit.
GID00007578	They had planted an NCR flag over the well and they would not budge until every last one of them was laid out, dead and cold.
GID00007579	So I walked up and told them there was a group of raiders coming, one hundred strong. I made up some cockamamie name for them and everything.
GID00007580	The men looked at each other, looked at us, and asked me what we were going to do about it.
GID00007581	I told him we would take them back into NCR territory because we had already lost ten rangers on the way out. Ten rangers, five men with .308 rifles.
GID00007582	Well, that was enough for them. They packed up what they could and we took them back north. Last I heard, they settled somewhere in Anza-Borrego.
GID00007583	Raised Bighorners. Had some tough times, but it worked out okay for them. So there you go. That's my one bit of good.
GID00007584	Joshua Graham, Caesar's old legate, he's wasn't so flexible.
GID00007585	When the Legion attacked Hoover Dam, General Oliver ordered his troopers back to the middle ground just after first contact.
GID00007586	Graham pushed all of the legionaries onto the dam, filling the east side with recruits up front and veterans in the back, by the book.
GID00007587	But once they were in, they were stuck there. Oliver's troopers were entrenched and wouldn't give a foot.
GID00007588	That's when we ordered the rangers and 1st recon sharpshooters to start picking off veteran legion officers from a high ridge west of the dam.
GID00007589	That only lasted about a minute before Graham ordered the back ranks to push through to the front and rush the ridge.
GID00007590	Caused total chaos among the younger legionaries, and Oliver's troopers fell back to the side walkways and stayed out of the veterans' way.
GID00007591	By the time the veterans got to the ridge, we were already in Boulder City.
GID00007592	They followed us down there, but we were out before they realized what was happening.
GID00007593	We had packed the old city with C4 and dynamite. Crude, but it did the job. Those who didn't die in the blast were in no position to mount a defense.
GID00007594	The ones left on the dam didn't know what to do. The troopers routed them. Graham pulled the remaining legionaries back, but the battle was over.
GID00007595	He went south, back to the Grand Canyon, back to Caesar. And that was the last we saw or heard from Joshua Graham.
GID00007596	Consider it the first of many bestowments.
GID00007597	What's wrong with you? This man shot you, stole from you, left you in the desert to die.
GID00007598	You need to work on your bloodthirst. We won't speak again until Benny is dead.
GID00007599	Walk away if you want, but if you do, he's going up on a cross. You're still making a choice.
GID00007600	Answer the question.
GID00007601	That's nothing new. Am I supposed to be impressed?
GID00007602	Run!
GID00007603	Get him!
GID00007604	Get her!
GID00007605	[SUCCEEDED] All right. Pickings were getting slim around here anyway.
GID00007606	[FAILED] Nope, not interested. No caps in letting people walk, you know.
GID00007607	Letting you just walk away isn't how it works, I'm afraid.
GID00007608	Yeah, get out of here.
GID00007609	Good. Chavez and his boys were last seen south of here. If you're lucky and he's careless, he might still be there.
GID00007610	Fuck you for wasting my time, then.
GID00007611	Chavez is the ringleader. Without him, his crew will fall apart, and I don't give a shit about those guys.
GID00007612	All right, then. Guess I'll just make a quiet exit - no need for a goodbye party or anything.
GID00007613	Understood.
GID00007614	When I need to, yes.
GID00007615	That's right. Fuck off.
GID00007616	Avenge Caesar!
GID00007617	You are free to leave.
GID00007618	Vale.
GID00007619	You are free to leave.
GID00007620	Then I'd have to help you! I mean, it seems pretty obvious Benny wouldn't have wanted me to, but hey, not my fault I can't say no!
GID00007621	Then I'd have to help you! I mean, it seems pretty obvious Benny wouldn't want me to, but hey, not my fault I can't say no!
GID00007622	Again, goal number one is to eliminate Mr. House and install my neuro-computational matrix on the Lucky 38's mainframe!
GID00007623	Given how you're a new arrival, I also recommend that you get to know some of the region's tribes, so you can decide how you feel about them!
GID00007624	By the time you've finished up all of that, the Legion should be close to attacking Hoover Dam and we'll execute the last phase of the plan!
GID00007625	It makes me feel really dumb to admit this, but I don't actually know! I've never been inside the Lucky 38. No one has!
GID00007626	Mr. House is in there, though! It's the central node of his entire network!
GID00007627	You already took care of Mr. House? Wow, you work fast!
GID00007628	I mean, Benny was always scheming about how he was going to get into the Lucky 38, but you already took care of that. Wow!
GID00007629	The other thing you're going to need is the Platinum Chip. You know, the one Benny killed a courier for, over near Goodsprings?
GID00007630	The Platinum Chip is the key to overriding and exploiting Mr. House's defenses!
GID00007631	Did I just say "exploiting?" That's not a very nice word!
GID00007632	I'll be waiting right here!
GID00007633	Sorry if that was getting boring!
GID00007634	If you're tired of a topic, I'm tired of it, too!
GID00007635	Whatever you say!
GID00007636	You bet!
GID00007637	What should we talk about next?
GID00007638	Okay! Who needs artillery support? Not the good guys, that's for sure!
GID00007639	There's a bunch! Some of them you've already met - like the Chairmen, for instance!
GID00007640	I think you should be sure to visit the other families on the Strip, the Omertas and the White Glove Society, so you know what makes them tick!
GID00007641	And there are some important groups farther from the Strip, too, like the Boomers, the Great Khans, and the Brotherhood of Steel!
GID00007642	Oh no, I didn't mean that! Who needs their support? The Securitrons will be all the support you need!
GID00007643	What I meant is, you should get to know these tribes and decide which ones you like and which you don't!
GID00007644	You know - shape the future of Vegas! Choose your neighbors! If you like a tribe, leave it alone!
GID00007645	Or if a tribe is nasty, or going to be a problem - go ahead and exterminate it! It's whatever you want to do!
GID00007646	Of course! Ask away!
GID00007647	Please go on!
GID00007648	That's one down, four to go.
GID00007649	That's two down, three to go.
GID00007650	That's three down, two to go.
GID00007651	That's four down, just one to go.
GID00007652	That accounts for all the tribes you needed to get to know!
GID00007653	Anything else I can help with?
GID00007654	Really? Talk about diplomatic skills! I mean, just not getting blown up was a success!
GID00007655	Now they'll only blow up the right sorts of people! That's what matters!
GID00007656	Problem solved! Quick and to the point! I like the way you work!
GID00007657	Then consider them ignored! If they end up firing their howitzers at us, we'll ignore that, too! Until it goes away!
GID00007658	The Khans are just... they're a dirty people. They live in tents like animals! And they're very rude!
GID00007659	They've been kicked around a lot, but no one's finished them off! Not yet, anyway!
GID00007660	They were one of the tribes the Three Families pushed out of Vegas! A whole bunch got killed!
GID00007661	So they settled at Bitter Springs, but they kept being so obnoxious, the NCR had to kill a whole bunch more of them!
GID00007662	So then they settle at Red Rock Canyon! There's just no getting rid of them!
GID00007663	You set the pace.
GID00007664	They must be a really nasty people! I haven't heard a single good thing about them!
GID00007665	They fire artillery on anyone who comes near their settlement at Nellis Air Force Base. Talk about rude!
GID00007666	If they can be convinced to fire those big cannons at the Legion or NCR, though, well - that'd be neat, wouldn't it?
GID00007667	Take all the time you need!
GID00007668	From what I understand, they're perfectly delightful! They're cultured, clean, and super-polite!
GID00007669	Benny didn't like them, though! He said they were "creepy."
GID00007670	Don't hurry on my account! I'm the one with the flexible schedule.
GID00007671	Some of Mr. House's data said that he'd lost a bunch of Securitron scouts near Hidden Valley!
GID00007672	Telemetry showed that they'd been attacked with energy weapons! House was pretty sure it was the Brotherhood!
GID00007673	There must be a bunch of them holed up there! Not a good place for a robot to visit!
GID00007674	They go around in big suits of power armor, and they have lots of energy weapons! But there's a downside!
GID00007675	They just have a thing about technology! They think it should all be theirs! If someone else has it, they get mad!
GID00007676	All I'm saying is, not much of a chance they'll accept a Vegas that polices itself with robots!
GID00007677	No rush! Take your time!
GID00007678	Hmm. I remember that Benny used to pay a receptionist at Gomorrah for information - maybe she knows something!
GID00007679	Just that Benny didn't like them! He talked on and on about how they couldn't be trusted! And this is coming from Benny!
GID00007680	He hated their casino, said it was tacky! And he thought they were up to something, because he said they always are!
GID00007681	Whenever you get around to it will be just fine!
GID00007682	If you say so! Consider them filed away under "not to be discussed again!"
GID00007683	Yay, that's great news! You finished what Mr. House and the NCR started! That's got to feel good!
GID00007684	Really? Okay! That sounds fun!
GID00007685	That's not aiding an enemy! Not when you do it!
GID00007686	Maybe they'll be devoured by giant scorpions! All sorts of things could happen to them out there!
GID00007687	Oooh, sounds dramatic! I like it! Wind them up and let them go!
GID00007688	No more Khans! That's great! They're just bad people...
GID00007689	Okay! Consider them forgotten! Along with the projections that predict they'll be our biggest enemy! Forgotten!
GID00007690	Really? That's... well, that's a surprise! They'll really want to blow me up!
GID00007691	But maybe dumb machines like me ought to get blown up and scrapped for salvage. Who knows? Not me!
GID00007692	You got it! I won't say another word about them!
GID00007693	Wow! That is amazing! You are just - a hero! I am serious!
GID00007694	You'd think it'd be bad for the Strip but... but I guess it must be good!
GID00007695	Yeah - take the Strip down a notch or two, right? That'll show it! Okay!
GID00007696	Say no more, say no more... if you say they're good, they're good!
GID00007697	A cannibalism problem? Really? I'm so glad you weren't eaten!
GID00007698	That's great news! I wish I could visit their casino! They have a refined sense of taste!
GID00007699	You did? That's... that's an unusual approach!
GID00007700	But I know it makes sense somehow if you're the one doing it! The problem is me!
GID00007701	You really know how to make a robot happy! Seriously, you just made my day.
GID00007702	I'll make my way there.
GID00007703	Back to the tomb, I suppose. If you need me, et cetera.
GID00007704	Nice! Can I order room service?
GID00007705	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00007706	Hey, as long as you're not asking me to go back to Black Mountain, I'm a happy old man.
GID00007707	<bark!>
GID00007708	All right... don't be long. Robots there give me the creeps.
GID00007709	All right. Guess Vegas it is.
GID00007710	Back to the gilded cage.
GID00007711	Nice children shouldn't stay in places like that, dearie! That's the sort of place Leo likes! But if you insist....
GID00007712	If this statement is being broadcast, I am deceased. Please approach a Securitron and take one of the printed obituaries.
GID00007713	I, Robert Edwin House, am deceased. Please approach a Securitron and take one of the printed obituaries.
GID00007714	Blow on the dice, baby. We're gonna need luck to get outta here alive.
GID00007715	Step closer to the demonstration area, if you would...
GID00007716	I expect you're well familiar with my Securitrons by now.
GID00007717	The titanium alloy housing that protects its electronic core deflects small arms and shrapnel easily enough...
GID00007718	Its X-25 gatling laser, produced to spec by Glastinghouse, Inc., is deadly against soft targets at medium range...
GID00007719	And for close-range suppression or crowd control, the Securitron is armed with a 9mm submachinegun.
GID00007720	All of this, you probably already knew...
GID00007721	What you did not know is that these are the Securitrons' secondary weapons.
GID00007722	All this time, my Securitrons have had to get by running the Mark I operating system, which lacked software drivers for their primary weapons!
GID00007723	Today, with the delivery of the Platinum Chip, all that changes. Behold, for the first time, Securitrons running the Mark II OS!
GID00007724	The M-235 Missile Launcher gives the Securitron the ability to engage ground and air targets at significantly longer ranges...
GID00007725	And a rapid-fire G-28 grenade launching system ensures the Securitron is deadly in close-range engagements.
GID00007726	The software upgrade also includes drivers for the Securitrons' highly sophisticated onboard auto-repair systems.
GID00007727	All together, the Mark II software upgrade confers a 235% increase in combat effectiveness per unit.
GID00007728	The city of New Vegas finally has soldiers worthy of protecting it!
GID00007729	Return to the penthouse now. We have much to discuss...
GID00007730	What about Boulder City?
GID00007731	Nice!
GID00007732	Okay.
GID00007733	Goodbye, thank you.
GID00007734	Fuck, I was getting tired of this place anyways. I can find girls to play with somewhere else.
GID00007735	I'm not sure I have anything I want to hear from you, but you can have your moment.
GID00007736	Then get the fuck out of my face.
GID00007737	Really? That two-faced son of a bitch. I'm glad now that we kept him mostly out of the loop. Look, we could use your help with some things.
GID00007738	Especially with Cachino gone, we could use another pair of competent hands, and I think you can provide that.
GID00007739	Precisely. You'll have no trouble joining the battle on their side, and they'll be too distracted to notice why you're really there.
GID00007740	An opinion you expressed with supreme subtlety and finesse. Moving on...
GID00007741	There's a job that needs doing here, and I'm assigning it to you.
GID00007742	Marvellous work ethic, bravo.
GID00007743	I much prefer working with robots...
GID00007744	You'll have to be more specific.
GID00007745	And how do you know this?
GID00007746	I see. So where does that put us?
GID00007747	[SUCCEEDED] In that case, I commend you for your initiative. What do you recommend for next steps?
GID00007748	[FAILED]And you assisted them? That's what you mean to say, isn't it?
GID00007749	Can't put the genie back in the bottle, is that it? Maybe you should've thought of that before you conspired to destroy my property.
GID00007750	That said, I'd know nothing of the Omertas' plot if you'd kept it secret. Perhaps I owe you my gratitude, after all...
GID00007751	The information you've provided will suffice. When the battle for Hoover Dam comes, I'll make sure my Securitrons are waiting for the Omertas.
GID00007752	I suppose you're right... When the Legion assaults Hoover Dam, my Securitrons will be waiting for the Omertas. They won't accomplish much.
GID00007753	Exactly how many civilians did you want to die in that crossfire?
GID00007754	Still, you raise a fair point. My Securitrons can handle this. When the Legion attacks Hoover Dam, I'll be waiting for the Omertas.
GID00007755	You're absolutely right. You must've had run-ins with them. As have I...
GID00007756	From time to time, the NCR has assaulted Brotherhood bunkers. In four of the six incidents I know of, the bunkers self-destructed.
GID00007757	I surmise it's standard practice for the Brotherhood to install a self-destruct system. It's consistent with their uncompromising nature.
GID00007758	You might use that against them. Or kill them another way, it's up to you. Return when it's done.
GID00007759	I can't use you. Had you shown moderation in your dealings with the NCR, we'd be in a different position.
GID00007760	Oh no, not so quick. I still have work for you.
GID00007761	Don't attack unless there are clear signs that Kimball's visit is imminent. Cause enough chaos to cancel the visit, no more. Then return to me.
GID00007762	Not so eager to take on a suicide mission, is that it? If you'd shown moderation in your dealings with the NCR, we wouldn't be in this position.
GID00007763	Whatever those reasons may be, you've jeopardized the success of this entire concern.
GID00007764	[SUCCEEDED] They knew you were coming? They were better prepared than I anticipated, then. I won't underestimate them again.
GID00007765	Before that happens, I'd ask you to complete one final task. It may seem trivial, but that's far from the case.
GID00007766	[FAILED] Whatever your reasons, you've jeopardized the success of this entire concern!
GID00007767	You could've succeeded!
GID00007768	With this accomplished, all preparations will have been made. The battle for Hoover Dam will be upon us before long.
GID00007769	The strain of defending Las Vegas from annhilation exceeded my power systems' capacity. My primary reactor shut down.
GID00007770	For years, I played a miser with my emergency power supply. I began to run out of reserves around the time I woke the first batch of Securitrons.
GID00007771	Negotiating an allotment of power from Hoover Dam was crucial. That's what's powered the Strip for the past seven years.
GID00007772	Come back when your work at the substation is done.
GID00007773	I needed the operating software on the Platinum Chip to bring it back online.
GID00007774	And to start the reactor itself requires a tremendous jolt of current. Very attention-getting.
GID00007775	The NCR has its hands full now, of course. I doubt they'll raise much of a fuss.
GID00007776	This is not a good time to be dependent on energy from Hoover Dam. When the Legion attacks, the NCR may cut power altogether.
GID00007777	And I'll be needing a good deal more power than the NCR has allotted to the Strip.
GID00007778	Broadcasting encrypted VMQ-boosted command signals to hundreds of Securitrons eats up more power than you might expect.
GID00007779	Indeed they do - an army that'll be too distracted with killing Legionaries to notice the real reason you're there.
GID00007780	Your objective is to reach a control room halfway across the dam and install an override module similar to the one you used at the Substation.
GID00007781	The override will enable to control the entire dam's power output.
GID00007782	You may remember how the bunker at the Fort was rather dimly lit? Well, just like the Lucky 38, it needs a big jolt of electricity to power up.
GID00007783	You've already uploaded the new operating system to the Securitrons. All they need is power and they'll be in fighting trim.
GID00007784	As I've said, your objective is to install an override module in the control room halfway across the dam. Are you ready perform this task?
GID00007785	Indeed you will. Just bear in mind that's not the reason you're there.
GID00007786	No cause for alarm - you'll have an escort of Securitrons to help you fight your way onto the dam.
GID00007787	Yeah, that's right - good to say bye to you.
GID00007788	Heck, I can smell trouble a mile away.
GID00007789	Sure you can, friend, but everyone needs a hand from time to time. Maybe you'll return the favor one day.
GID00007790	I wouldn't put it exactly like that, friend.
GID00007791	See ya round, buckaroo.
GID00007792	Well, happy trails, then!
GID00007793	'Til our trails cross again, pardner.
GID00007794	Heh, I like you, friend. Have I mentioned that?
GID00007795	Most of the limestone comes from Quarry Junction out west. The supply had stopped for awhile because of a Deathclaw problem.
GID00007796	I heard some badass wastelander killed the Deathclaws, and deliveries of limestone have been coming in again.
GID00007797	I don't think they've gotten the trains up and running yet, but most of the concrete plant workers have come back to town now. Good for business.
GID00007798	Most of the limestone comes from Quarry Junction out west, but I hear some Deathclaws overran the quarry.
GID00007799	With no work to be had, all the workers around here have wandered off. I'm the only one left in town.
GID00007800	It's tough on both sides of the fence, really. I think women have it worse. They're like money, given as rewards. Breeding stock.
GID00007801	Honestly, as long as men meet obligations and the child count, "friendships" are a sight more equal than the level of most Legion husbands and wives.
GID00007802	Yeah, I lived through it. I like it here better.
GID00007803	A pittance, sugar - and I'll leave you without a care in the world.
GID00007804	Sorry, ma'am, but ain't enough caps in all of New Vegas to make me do that. Nuh-uh.
GID00007805	Same price as before, sugar, and the same fun, too.
GID00007806	I told you, I ain't ever doing that again - ever. It was like being a slave all over again.
GID00007807	Oh, we will, sugar. We will.
GID00007808	I'll do my best to live up to my last performance.
GID00007809	You can play hard-to-get. I understand. I know the game.
GID00007810	Oh honey, I know you're interested. I just don't go that way is all.
GID00007811	No freebies, Sugar. Not even for you.
GID00007812	See you.
GID00007813	Me and my partner Saint James work salvage around Westside, that's all.
GID00007814	Because it's his name. He may be high-strung, but he's all right. Hauls his half of scrap, which is all I need.
GID00007815	Don't believe everything you hear. Me and Saint James earn our caps working salvage.
GID00007816	It's hard work, so when I'm not working I like to relax. Which means it's time for you to fuck off.
GID00007817	Like I told you, we work salvage. We aren't coyotes. And like I told you, fuck off.
GID00007818	Yep, for a few years now. Guess I should be calling it Casa Marco or something, but I haven't changed the signs.
GID00007819	Folks who can't pay their way onto the Strip need a place to stay, too. And when Pretty Sarah set her whores up here, the Casa went full-service.
GID00007820	Roughneck prospector is all I hear, good at what he does. Been renting a room here for a year or so - nothing special.
GID00007821	Him? Caesar's Legion taught him everything he knows. I bet there's a pound of sand ground into his palms and knees!
GID00007822	Knowing Jimmy, I'm sure he took good care of them. I'm surprised he ran away!
GID00007823	Oh, I know everything - how she smells, how she tastes, how it feels to slip her on and wiggle.
GID00007824	Damn fine woman, but damn expensive, too. Just ask Saint James - he spends near every cap he gets on Sweetie's sweets.
GID00007825	Catch you later, then.
GID00007826	Ain't so pretty, is she? Not since she had a run-in with those Fiends over near McCarran.
GID00007827	This Fiend named Cook-Cook on account of the flamethrower he wears? He had his way with Sarah, every way it can be done.
GID00007828	Then he starts frying her up for kicks. Guess it was how he signed his work.
GID00007829	Like who?
GID00007830	All right, then.
GID00007831	That's right. Strange at first, having a woman for a pimp, but she's tough enough to handle any trouble so far.
GID00007832	She's a good earner. Of course, she don't care who she sleeps with or what they do to her.
GID00007833	You know where to find me, honey.
GID00007834	Good luck.
GID00007835	You won't notice anything once the lights are out, hon. The places that count are still firm enough...
GID00007836	Well, don't just stand there. I ain't getting any younger.
GID00007837	Well, I'm not a goddamn charity, so come back when you do.
GID00007838	I'll be right here if you change your mind, honey. Just let me know.
GID00007839	I suppose he's okay, for one of those. I suppose Pretty Sarah's got to cover every sort of customer.
GID00007840	Those boys been living here a while now. They sell salvage and do all right. I never been with either of them.
GID00007841	That Saint James is all over Sweetie every time he rustles up the caps to afford her. She says he's peculiar but who isn't?
GID00007842	You know where to find me.
GID00007843	What do you even mean? He's Dermot.
GID00007844	Dermot knows how to work salvage than any man I ever met. Doesn't go asking questions all day, neither.
GID00007845	That's private. I don't go asking about how you like to get laid, and I don't wanna know. Enough of that.
GID00007846	Get ready, honey. I'm going to make it good for you.
GID00007847	Let me help you slip into something a little more comfortable.
GID00007848	I am going to make your toes curl, baby.
GID00007849	So get on the bed already. I got something to show you.
GID00007850	You know you'll be back.
GID00007851	Then I guess you won't be getting on me, either. Improve your prospects and come back, sugar. I'll be waiting.
GID00007852	Keep telling yourself that, sugar. You'll be back.
GID00007853	A client's got a right to privacy. So it'll cost 200 caps for me to tell you all about it.
GID00007854	Like I said - 200 caps to hear all about it.
GID00007855	[SUCCEEDED] Funny how I make caps every time I open my mouth.
GID00007856	Saint James has problems, that's for sure. Never wants me to say a thing, or for me to move around, either.
GID00007857	Lately he brings a teddy bear with him and props it on the bed like it's watching us. It's creepy as hell.
GID00007858	Not the worst I ever been with, but more a pervert than most.
GID00007859	[FAILED] I'll leave it. You can leave, too.
GID00007860	Saint James has problems, that's for sure. Never wants me to say a thing, or for me to move around, either.
GID00007861	Lately he brings a teddy bear with him and props it on the bed like it's watching us. It's creepy as hell.
GID00007862	Not the worst I ever been with, but more a pervert than most.
GID00007863	Then I guess there's no need for us to keep talking, honey. Sorry.
GID00007864	Fine by me. You the one missing out on exciting details.
GID00007865	Sure do. Saint James is my number one customer. He's a prospector who pays Marco to stay here at the Casa week to week.
GID00007866	I don't know why his friend Dermot chose to stay here - he's never been with me or nobody else. But Saint James likes having me close at hand.
GID00007867	It ain't much to look at, but this dump has something that even the Strip doesn't, and that's absolute freedom.
GID00007868	You go other places, and there's always someone screaming at you to act a certain way, or to not do certain things.
GID00007869	Freeside's not like that. Everyone here is free to do whatever they want, and I for one wouldn't want it any other way.
GID00007870	Not much to tell. We're a bunch of guys that just want to do our own thing, and anyone who's got a problem with that can shove it.
GID00007871	I didn't join the Kings. I helped start the Kings. This whole operation you see here was put together by the King and yours truly.
GID00007872	You're looking to get past those tin cans at the gate, right? They let people by all the time, if they've got the caps.
GID00007873	But if you're not rich, and I can tell you ain't, the King might be able to help you out, provided he likes you.
GID00007874	Sure.
GID00007875	What about it? Someone takes your stuff, you're free to take it back. If you can't, maybe you shouldn't have come to Freeside in the first place.
GID00007876	We do what we want, just like everybody else. We just have more guys, so other people tend to do what we want, too.
GID00007877	If somebody does something we don't like, we let them know about it. If they're strong enough not to care about us liking it, good for them.
GID00007878	Pfff, that's old news. I had some fun with that girl that runs their operation, and then I got tired of her. So I moved on.
GID00007879	She don't like that, see? Normally, I bet she'd just have a guy killed for doing that, but as you can see, I'm still around.
GID00007880	Most people think it's cause she doesn't want to start an all-out war with us, but that ain't it at all. She's still got it bad for me.
GID00007881	Dangerous... I like that. Maybe it's time people starting being afraid of me rather than the other way around.
GID00007882	Oh yeah, I wanted to tell you that I got some new info for you. Each tip's gonna cost 100 caps now though.
GID00007883	Cause I got plans. Big plans. So what do you say? Want a tip?
GID00007884	Unfortunately, it comes with the territory around here. But being afraid sucks, no doubt about it.
GID00007885	Oh, hey, I almost forgot to tell you I heard a few things you might be interested in.
GID00007886	I'm kind of sorry about this, but I'm going to have to up my price to 100 caps per tip from now on.
GID00007887	It's getting tougher to discover new things that might interest a traveler such as yourself. I'm sure you understand. So, you interested or what?
GID00007888	Yeah... yeah, that's a good idea. They'll learn that shouldn't have messed with me. Just wait till they get what's coming to them!
GID00007889	You really think so, pal? I'll start looking into it. I bet I can help a lot of people around here.
GID00007890	You're probably right. This place has been going downhill for a long time. Maybe I could start over somewhere else.
GID00007891	Just think of it. A new life...
GID00007892	Oh yeah, I heard some new things that you might find interesting. I'm going to have to start charging 100 caps per tip, though.
GID00007893	After all, I have to save up for my ticket out of here, right? So how about it? Want a tip?
GID00007894	What? N-No, I knew you were just kidding. Ha ha. You're a funny one, all right.
GID00007895	That's true, you seem to always be on the move and it seems to be working out for you pretty well.
GID00007896	I've already got a decent amount saved up. If I keep it up, there's no reason I shouldn't be able to go start over somewhere else soon.
GID00007897	That's a hell of a thing to say. Build up a man's hopes, then dash them in front of him.
GID00007898	And who says I couldn't survive just as well as you out there? People are always underestimating me, damn.
GID00007899	This place is a shithole, but yeah, it's home. I've lived here all my life. I'd be leaving a piece of myself behind if I left.
GID00007900	There'd be things I'd miss - the fun of watching the Kings kick the crap out of a thief, or the look of joy on a child's face after catching a rat.
GID00007901	Ah, now you've got me all nostalgic-like. Maybe I'd be better off trying to find a way to make this place better than giving up and leaving.
GID00007902	You're a real piece of work, you know that?
GID00007903	It's cool. I'm just a little touchy about people making fun of me, especially smoothskins. But you're not all bad. Take the Followers, for example.
GID00007904	Why, just the other week, one of them offered me a job. Can you imagine? Me, with a real job?
GID00007905	Can you imagine? Me? With a real job?
GID00007906	Yeah, I bet you have. Not important enough for you to remember, huh?
GID00007907	You said it. With these threads, people are finally going to start noticing me.
GID00007908	Fuck you, human. We don't all share your wonderful complexion. Some of us have to make do, you know?
GID00007909	Anyway, I was just going to tell you that I've come across some new tidbits you might find interesting.
GID00007910	And since you're just about my favorite person in the world, each one is only going to cost you 100 caps. Interested?
GID00007911	Yeesh, you're just all business, aren't you? Well, I like how I look, and that's what's important. Though it'd be nice if other people did too.
GID00007912	I don't want to mention it out in plain sight like this. You never know who might be listening. Follow me.
GID00007913	Well, don't wait too long. What I've got is something you'd need to act on, quick.
GID00007914	Wow, I didn't think it would be this easy. I should have done this years ago. Guess I'll be going then.
GID00007915	Oh, here's a final tip - don't ever follow anyone into a dark alley in Freeside. Later, chump.
GID00007916	Man, I'm tired of scrounging for caps from ungrateful idiots like you. It's past time I moved on to bigger and better things.
GID00007917	Now are you going to hand over your caps, or am I going to shoot you and take them anyway?
GID00007918	Then you give me no choice.
GID00007919	You're welcome to try.
GID00007920	Yeah. The man I'm more interested in is Corporal White.
GID00007921	White had a lot of promise. Wanted to be a ranger as bad as anyone I've seen. But he also had some extracurricular activities going. Now he's gone.
GID00007922	Sure, if you want to investigate. It's not like there's anything to steal up there. Just a bunch of old communications equipment.
GID00007923	If you can find out any more, I'd be interested to hear it.
GID00007924	There's something about this I really don't like, and if I weren't tied up here I'd be staking it out personally.
GID00007925	Better believe it. Everybody, everybody in Caesar's Legion from Caesar on down will kill themselves before they can be captured.
GID00007926	They're so twitchy they'd probably do it if you reached out to hug them.
GID00007927	But here's this guy who's an elite commander in their army and he just gives himself up, even as his men are slitting their own throats around him.
GID00007928	Well, I don't know about you, but to me that sounds like a man who's willing to cooperate. Except he hasn't.
GID00007929	Only times he speaks up are to insult you. He's a real prick, by the way. And I'm supposed to get information out of this guy.
GID00007930	I think if you rough him up enough and really put some fear into him, he'll sing like a choir boy.
GID00007931	So let's do this. When you're ready, I'll go in and give you a little intro. Then I leave the room and you make him regret the day he was born.
GID00007932	We go back and forth a couple of times until either he talks or he can't move his jaw anymore. Either way we've had our entertainment for the day.
GID00007933	Time was essential for my mission, but we waited three days for him to dispatch us. Another of his headaches. Does that sound like a man in command?
GID00007934	He has an operative planted in this very base, but does he use his agent to rescue me? No.
GID00007935	He's content to have the agent spend his nights radioing troop positions back to our base camp. He knows I'm here, and he's left me to rot.
GID00007936	I haven't breathed a word about the officer we planted here - he continues to radio intelligence to Caesar's camp nearly every night.
GID00007937	I've proven my loyalty. All you're doing is killing a loyal soldier. If that's Caesar's policy, then I say his empire will crumble.
GID00007938	What? No! Listen, Caesar's secrets are safe with me. I stayed alive because Caesar would've wanted it. I'm useless to him dead.
GID00007939	Then he's a fool!
GID00007940	I knew you'd be reasonable. Now... how did you find me? Did the officer send you?
GID00007941	No! Stay away from me!
GID00007942	D-d-damn right.
GID00007943	Carry on.
GID00007944	We're at your service, if you need us. Until Driver Nephi is dead. Major's orders.
GID00007945	Oh my God, are you okay? You've gotta get to a medic. Doc Kemp can patch you up back at base.
GID00007946	How could you just sacrifice your body like that? You never even met him. If the NCR doesn't have a medal for this, they should make one up.
GID00007947	I don't believe it. Who the hell are you, man? How did you just walk right up and pull him out of there?
GID00007948	I don't believe it. Who the hell are you, lady? How did you just walk right up and pull him out of there?
GID00007949	Bullshit. What anybody else would've done is get their asses killed. You're leading some kind of charmed life.
GID00007950	We'll make sure Ranger Morales' body gets sent back home. You don't have to, you know, pick him up on your shoulder and haul him to California.
GID00007951	Even though I believe you would if you had to. You should go tell Private Morales the news. I know she'll be relieved.
GID00007952	That must be some kind of code of honor you hold yourself to. You're like a woman possessed.
GID00007953	That must be some kind of code of honor you hold yourself to. You're like a man possessed.
GID00007954	Yeah, well, it looks like it might be too late for the Fiends. But we got the message loud and clear.
GID00007955	The Gun Runners are almost straight north of here. A little east. Isaac has a house in their compound.
GID00007956	Yeah. It means you don't get shot.
GID00007957	The Crimson Caravan is up north past the Gun Runners. During the day Blake is usually in their main office.
GID00007958	Pawn shop in Westside called Miguel's. It's in outer Vegas, northwest of the Strip.
GID00007959	You mean other than some stranger with no military ID interrogating me inside our base?
GID00007960	Did Boyd put you up to this? I am so sick of this harassment. You tell her to stop wasting my time with this bullshit.
GID00007961	No. I haven't seen anything suspicious. It's been business as usual.
GID00007962	See you.
GID00007963	Most people already know we run this territory, and are usually in a hurry to get out. Not this guy. It's like he wants us to come get him.
GID00007964	Not "ha ha" funny, you moron. Funny as in suspicious. He's not trying to run away like most people.
GID00007965	I know the NCR has troops near Primm, so talk to the locals and find out if any of those troops are going to be coming our way.
GID00007966	Why do you care? Answer: you shouldn't. I don't feel like trading life stories.
GID00007967	It was all Cooke's idea. He and his boys managed to swipe some dynamite and hide it away in their cells.
GID00007968	The rest of us just tagged along. Cooke's crew headed north while the rest of us stuck around for payback.
GID00007969	The NCR called it a "work-release" prison. We lucky prisoners got the privilege of fixing up the rail lines and blasting rock for new lines.
GID00007970	They got sloppy, though. Some of us managed to hide away some dynamite, and look who's in charge now.
GID00007971	He and his crew went north. I heard talk about some sort of "big plan" to get back at the NCR, but haven't seen them since.
GID00007972	One mean son of a bitch. Really, truly hates the NCR for some reason, and he got a lot of the other guys around to his way of thinking.
GID00007973	Later.
GID00007974	I was an NCR medic for six months, so I'm not exactly a "doctor." Still, it's more medical training that any of the other guys here.
GID00007975	It also gives me an excuse to stay out of any raiding parties. The gang can't lose its only doctor now, can it?
GID00007976	Medical supplies go for a decent amount of caps in the right markets. I figured the quartermaster wouldn't notice any missing. I was wrong.
GID00007977	Let's see... I've been a farmhand, a bouncer, a bandit, and an NCR trooper. I don't recommend any of them.
GID00007978	The location to the highway makes it a good spot to shake down any travelers passing through. That's why Eddie and the rest are still around.
GID00007979	Me, I like having big walls between myself and the wasteland.
GID00007980	One night, there was a big explosion from the other cell block. I had no idea what was going on, so I took cover in my bunk.
GID00007981	When it was all over, the guards were dead and we were free. Most of the other prisoners scattered, but a few of us stuck around, obviously.
GID00007982	I was a sheriff, believe it or not, for a small town far to the west of here.
GID00007983	The short version is that sometimes justice is a little slow, and I helped speed it up one too many times.
GID00007984	I'm not sorry for anything I did, but I will do the time. Fair enough trade, if you ask me.
GID00007985	I understand that Cooke was behind it all. I kept my head down the whole time. Didn't want any part of it.
GID00007986	I stuck around, figuring the NCR would show up and put things back the way they were. No sense in making myself look guilty, right?
GID00007987	Watch yourself out there.
GID00007988	Some kind of anti-NCR rebel. Some people just don't like being pushed around and told what to do.
GID00007989	He went north with some of the other guys. Didn't say where, didn't say why. All I know is he's got some kind of score to settle with the NCR.
GID00007990	I'm not quite sure the kind of greeting NCR troopers will give an escaped con like myself. Figure it's better to stay put for now.
GID00007991	Right now, Eddie and his boys run the place. They've got the guns and the dynamite, so they call the shots.
GID00007992	Do you mean that he's a goner? I can have my Vault back?
GID00007993	That's just super! I thought we'd never see a different New Vegas, one that belongs to the people.
GID00007994	Let's proceed.
GID00007995	Inform me when you are ready to go.
GID00007996	All right, forget about blaming Crenshaw. Just bomb the monorail.
GID00007997	Without a fall guy, it's dangerous for us to be seen together. We shouldn't speak again.
GID00007998	If you believe in the Legion's cause, your mission is a reward in and of itself. Good luck.
GID00007999	You want my advice, start by talking to people with a lot of eyes in the field. People like Lieutenant Boyd, or Sergeant Contreras, maybe.
GID00008000	Careful with Contreras, though. He's not above suspicion himself.
GID00008001	Keep me apprised of any leads you get. This guy's gotten a lot of my men killed. I'm just itching to return the favor.
GID00008002	Put the bomb in one of the vents inside the train on the back wall, towards the joint that connects the cars. Arm it, and get out of there.
GID00008003	I've also left some bomb ingredients in with the explosives. You are to take those to the footlocker of a Private Crenshaw.
GID00008004	Crenshaw's a problem child. Lots of run-ins with his superiors. It'll be easy for them to believe he's working for the Legion.
GID00008005	Report him to Colonel Hsu. Do all that and we should be free and clear.
GID00008006	Oh, and Crenshaw should be dead before you report him. Don't leave any chance for him to deny the bombings. Let's say he pulled a gun on you.
GID00008007	I've got him on guard duty patrolling the tarmac just inside the south gate. And I reassigned the other guard, so he should be alone.
GID00008008	His footlocker is in the barracks in the main concourse.
GID00008009	Okay.
GID00008010	Ah, that. I'm surprised he didn't send you to Colonel Moore. That'd be her jurisdiction.
GID00008011	I've already received a communique from Colonel Moore saying that she's sent a squad down to Freeside.
GID00008012	If you'd come to me first, I might have been able to do something. But at this point, my hands are tied. Sorry.
GID00008013	Because he's looking to avoid a bloodbath. I get it. He knows me.
GID00008014	All right. Moore's not gonna like it. But that's for Crocker to worry about.
GID00008015	Go to the leader of the Kings and tell him that I'll make sure Freeside gets more water, power, and food as long as the violence there stops.
GID00008016	Well, I do get to make the calls on the distribution of supplies there.
GID00008017	Crocker was probably counting on me being able to offer the Kings a carrot. And that's what I'm inclined to do.
GID00008018	Moore's got her hands full right now, and she's not a subtle person in the best of times. Her solution would be quick and dirty.
GID00008019	I agree with Crocker that a more peaceful solution is preferable, especially for the long term.
GID00008020	Yeah. On top of everything else, I can't send a patrol on a bathroom break without it being ambushed by someone who heard they were coming.
GID00008021	So somebody's getting the word out.
GID00008022	Now we're trying to secure the Strip and the Dam at the same time, and it's costing us.
GID00008023	And in the meantime General Oliver won't approve any offensive maneuvers because he doesn't want to risk losing our positions.
GID00008024	So we're in a holding pattern here. And Caesar's on the other side of the river, planning.
GID00008025	It's our main base. We took it because it lets us keep an eye on the Strip. And it had already been fortified before the Great War.
GID00008026	From here we handle most of the logistics for our operations in Nevada. Troop allocation, supply distribution, intel.
GID00008027	Usually General Oliver runs the show here, but he's on his way to the Dam now, so I've taken on a lot of his duties here.
GID00008028	Unfortunately, no. In fact, the word from the Ranger stations has been especially concerning lately.
GID00008029	It sounds like they've run into overwhelming resistance, and supplies just aren't reaching them.
GID00008030	It's been so bad I asked Sergeant Reyes at Camp Forlorn Hope to look into it and see how it is that things could be so fouled up there.
GID00008031	Everything was going according to President Kimball's plan at first. We met minor resistance from local troublemakers.
GID00008032	But our two main objectives are still contested. Mr. House controls the Strip and he won't so much as meet with our ambassador.
GID00008033	And we're holding Hoover Dam, but Caesar's Legion is positioning itself to overrun it. If it falls, so will New Vegas. We'd be forced to withdraw.
GID00008034	Holy Christ. Get- get away from me!
GID00008035	Hell, it's all dangerous. Know why? Because you can't trust anything that stands on two legs.
GID00008036	If you're looking for the real trouble, head straight into the mountains. Men don't walk up there, for good reasons, kid.
GID00008037	If you're looking for the real trouble, head straight into the mountains. Men don't walk up there, for good reasons, kid.
GID00008038	This is bullshit! Why are we even talking about dealing with these guys?
GID00008039	Pace, this isn't really a good time to have this discussion...
GID00008040	Wrong. This is exactly the right time. I'm about to prevent you from making a huge mistake.
GID00008041	Pace, don't do this. I won't stand with you if you do.
GID00008042	Then I'll stand on my own, just like I always have. Just like a King should.
GID00008043	Okay, I need some answers, now. These guys just barged in here and said they were under orders to keep me here until you arrived.
GID00008044	I'm about five seconds away from telling my men to take them down, so speak fast.
GID00008045	Maybe you can tell me what the hell is going on here. These stony face bastards haven't said a word other than to say they're here under orders.
GID00008046	Guess he wants to do this the hard way, boys. Take him down.
GID00008047	An ultimatum? Do you even know who you're talking to? We're the Kings, and no King will ever accept an ultimatum.
GID00008048	Go back to your general or commodore or whatever-the-fuck and tell them to shove their ultimatum where the sun don't shine.
GID00008049	You know, it's that "or else" part that gets stuck in my craw. It just sounds a little too much like you're trying to tell us what to do.
GID00008050	And nobody tells the Kings what to do. So why don't you and all of your little friends get the hell out of here. Or else.
GID00008051	Well, Freeside citizens are also being attacked and I'd like you all to stop it, but I'm guessing that's not going to happen, is it?
GID00008052	This little show of force accomplishes nothing. So take your toy soldiers and go home. Show's over.
GID00008053	That sounds fair. And all I have to do is try to tone down the attacks on the Squatters, you say?
GID00008054	And I suppose they want me to help see that happen? That seems pretty reasonable.
GID00008055	Sounds like a challenge. Boys, let's do this!
GID00008056	It's a beastly place. Poverty is rampant, and all that goes with it - drugs, alcohol abuse, the usual.
GID00008057	Violence is something of a way of life there, but there's been a disturbing rise in the number of attacks on our people lately.
GID00008058	More worrying is the fact that our sources suggest the violence is being perpetrated by the gang that runs the place, the Kings.
GID00008059	I need someone to look into this that won't attract attention. Would you be interested?
GID00008060	Aw, sugar, why'd you have to go make Mr. House mad? Now we've got to get all messy shooting you to little bits.
GID00008061	Why, sugar, he's the maximum utmost! If it weren't for Mr. House, we wouldn't have this fabulous wonderland of New Vegas, would we?
GID00008062	This is the Lucky 38 Resort and Casino - or, it used to be. Mr. House has kept the place locked up tight for ages now, nobody comes in or out.
GID00008063	Why I'm a RobCo PDQ-88b Mk I Securitron, you silly goose! We're the finest in personal or civil robotic security on the market!
GID00008064	How sweet of you to notice, sugar! I've been upgraded to the Mark II software, and it's peachy having these high-explosive weapons fully accessible!
GID00008065	Not many people know this, but Mr. House is one of the world's biggest collectors of antique snow globes!
GID00008066	If you happen to find any out in the Wasteland, you can bring them to me and I'll add them to his collection! You'll get a reward, of course.
GID00008067	In fact, one of Mr. House's favorites went missing when we moved the collection. If you have a look around the Lucky 38, you might even find it!
GID00008068	You do? Why, that's just wonderful! I'll take it and put it with the rest of the collection.
GID00008069	You do? Why, that's just wonderful! I'll take them and put them with the rest of the collection.
GID00008070	Oh, there's lots of things to tell, I'm sure. There's the Three Families, the casinos, the other attractions - what would you like to know?
GID00008071	You make an excellent point. I never liked that Cachino fuck anyway. Here you go.
GID00008072	With those skinny little arms? Not before the bouncer put two in the back of your head. Now stop being stupid.
GID00008073	You make an excellent point. I never liked that Cachino fuck anyway. Here you go.
GID00008074	With those skinny little arms? Not before the bouncer put two in the back of your head. Now stop being stupid.
GID00008075	Well, of course I am, silly! Mr. House is just the smartest, most wonderful man there ever was!
GID00008076	Why, did you know he single-handedly reclaimed New Vegas from all those nasty tribes that used to live here?
GID00008077	Well, he single-handedly sent in his Securitrons to do it, but that counts in my book.
GID00008078	Sugar, I may be a robot on the outside, but on the inside, my neuro-computational matrix is an exact copy of Mr. House's favorite girl.
GID00008079	Anything you like, sugar.
GID00008080	Mr. House has a lot of needs, sugar. I take care of all of them, and a lady doesn't kiss and tell.
GID00008081	Then maybe you shouldn't pry into a lady's particulars, hmm?
GID00008082	They're just new money, sugar. They might pretend they're sophisticated, but between you and me, they're not far off from tribals.
GID00008083	The Omertas especially are just awful brutes. The Chairmen and the White Glove Society at least pretend to have some culture.
GID00008084	Well, of course there used to be a lot more of them, but these days there are three open to the public: The Tops, the Ultra-Luxe, and Gomorrah.
GID00008085	And the Lucky 38 of course, but we're not open to the public. You're a special case, sugar.
GID00008086	Well, let's see: the NCR has an embassy here, but why you'd want to go talk to a bunch of boring old politicians I surely don't know.
GID00008087	Oh, and the Vault 21 Hotel and Gift Shop has an adorable collection of old Vault-Tec memorabilia.
GID00008088	And I suppose if you like neon signs, you might check out Michael Angelo's sign shop.
GID00008089	Hey, listen, I'd love to sell you some more info, but you've tapped everything I've heard lately.
GID00008090	Come back in a few days. I'll put my ear to the ground and hopefully have heard a few more things by then.
GID00008091	What do ya say, want another tip?
GID00008092	I got more where that came from. Want another?
GID00008093	That one was pretty good, right? How about another?
GID00008094	I've heard here and there that the word "Hope" has recently become quite popular with the Squatters.
GID00008095	But that's all I've heard. If I knew more, I'd try to bilk you out of more caps. You interested in one of my other tips?
GID00008096	Exactly what I was thinking. It's nice to have a little style, you know?
GID00008097	But you're probably here for more of my special commodity, and luckily for you, I haven't been idle since last we spoke.
GID00008098	However, all that hard work on my part means that the price has gone up. 100 a tip, now. You game?
GID00008099	Oh yeah, what would you have gotten?
GID00008100	Yeah, it does look pretty sweet, doesn't i- hey, screw you! Who asked you anyway? The crap I put up with...
GID00008101	Yeah... that's a good idea... no sense making money and waiting for someone to just come and take it, right?
GID00008102	Hmmm... you're a long-term thinker, man. I like that. You might be on to something there.
GID00008103	...Really? Wow, it never occurred to me to actually give the money away. Do people really do things like that?
GID00008104	Of course, after all you did for me, here are some chips for you. Play, have some fun.
GID00008105	You play some games, have some fun. You did right by us.
GID00008106	Real subtle. Here you go. Play some games. Have some fun.
GID00008107	I'm not afraid of a gunfight, but I'd rather get back to Red Rock without a few extra holes in me if I can help it.
GID00008108	You and me at Gomorrah, rolled up in those silk sheets. I got leave coming up in a bit, so let me know if you'll be around.
GID00008109	Yup.
GID00008110	All right, you can go on in. Can't guarantee your safety, though. Just saying.
GID00008111	Quit wasting my time.
GID00008112	Wow, you sound awesome.
GID00008113	That is a neat idea. I'll be the spotter. I'll find someone to play the target.
GID00008114	Ooo, you know a lot about dinosaurs.
GID00008115	You bet I will, I'm almost old enough to fly in the VR sims. That'll be awesome!
GID00008116	Very well traveller. You may pass.
GID00008117	You better believe it. I'll knock your block off!
GID00008118	Yes! It has been a long time since La Fantoma had a good sidekick!
GID00008119	I've been around dogs all my life. They're my life, always were - all the way back when I was a tribal, one of the Hangdogs, outside Denver.
GID00008120	Dogs roamed that city. Our tribe made peace with them. Thought they were our spirit animals - helped us hunt, provided for us in some lean times.
GID00008121	Then the Legion came. Good thing, too. Stronger now, don't need those beliefs anymore.
GID00008122	When the Legion showed up, we fought, most tribes did. Hangdogs hung out longer than most... broke us by throwing our dogs on the fire.
GID00008123	So we gave up, our elders couldn't bear the idea of our spirit animals burning in the afterlife.
GID00008124	Still, Caesar was impressed enough to conscript us, use our skills with dogs to join the Legion as houndmasters.
GID00008125	Be seeing you around.
GID00008126	Vale.
GID00008127	Antony said he was punishing me for trying to hide it from the Legion.
GID00008128	Vale.
GID00008129	Seek Caesar by way of Cottonwood Cove, south of Nelson. The Cursor Lucullus will be waiting.
GID00008130	We are soldiers of a different stripe, capable in battle, but skilled as infiltrators and agents as well.
GID00008131	You're kicking me into gear, huh? I think I'll drive my chassis over to your pad. Wait for me down there, and don't forget the oil.
GID00008132	Carlitos, huh? Yeah, I do. Try the diner, but don't start any trouble, you hear?
GID00008133	Mitch!? You know "mole-butt?"
GID00008134	I hadn't thought about that name in a long time. I was just a child, and he had a big mole in his rear bumper.
GID00008135	You understand, kids and all that. Everyone knows about each other in a Vault, there's no other way. I hope mol... I mean Mitch, is doing well!
GID00008136	Vault 21's previous manager is no longer capable of servicing your needs. Hotel arrangement functions are now purview of Mr. House.
GID00008137	Observe the rules, citizen.
GID00008138	Proceed to your accomodations. Please, enjoy your stay at Vault 21.
GID00008139	Vault 21 hopes to service your needs in the future. Goodbye.
GID00008140	You mean, Mitch? It's been ages since I've heard the name. My sister and I used to call him "Mole-butt." Don't ask.
GID00008141	That was a long time ago, before we exchanged the warmth of our home for the thin air of the Wasteland.
GID00008142	I'm not one for running a business. Never really had a head for numbers or smooth-talk. My talents are a little more... direct.
GID00008143	Mama always said that was my gift. When we were kids, the others used to fight over and steal one another's toys. I always broke mine.
GID00008144	And if any of the others messed with me, I broke theirs too. Sometimes I'd break them even if they were nice to me, just to show them what's what.
GID00008145	One day mama took me aside and said, "Boy, you're never going to go very far, but you're going to make a whole lotta people come up short."
GID00008146	Make it quick. I got shit to do.
GID00008147	Glory? Glory's fucking crazy.
GID00008148	Some of my siblings are real pieces of work, but I'd bet on Glory if she were facing down a deathclaw with a plastic spoon.
GID00008149	She's got the smarts to do whatever she wants, but she and momma are always butting heads, so she gets all the shit jobs.
GID00008150	Where else?
GID00008151	Nah, I'm gonna chill with my girl.
GID00008152	Can't. The King's got me busy on something.
GID00008153	Thanks for getting me outta that cage! Now for once will you just lay down and stay down?
GID00008154	No one rules Vegas except me, got it? You're a lowdown gofer! You deliver mail!
GID00008155	How ya like being Mister Good-Two-Shoes, hey? How's it feeling?
GID00008156	How ya like being Miss Good-Two-Shoes, hey? How's it feeling?
GID00008157	Sweet to offer, baby, but if you cut these ropes every Legionary in this camp's gonna come running. With machetes.
GID00008158	Now on the other hand, if I had a Stealth Boy and a Bobby Pin, I could see myself out. Know what I mean?
GID00008159	I know I been bad, but it's cruel to jerk me around like this...
GID00008160	Like I said, baby, all Benny needs is a Stealth Boy and a Bobby Pin.
GID00008161	Baby... your generosity and spirit of forgiveness? Off the charts.
GID00008162	This little care package is everything I need. I'll take it from here.
GID00008163	Baby, if you show me the door to scramsville, that's where I'll go - out of your hair, never to return.
GID00008164	I been a fink to you, caused more than my share of grief by a hard mile. Let me go, you won't see me again.
GID00008165	No one likes a tease, baby.
GID00008166	Then stop bringing it up!
GID00008167	Check's in the mail, hey? Don't get my hopes up.
GID00008168	Yeah? What about it?
GID00008169	Yeah, we talked about it, but that went a big fat nowhere.
GID00008170	It's too late for that, baby. This decision you gotta make is going down now. So what's it gonna be?
GID00008171	What am I gonna say? "No thanks?"
GID00008172	If you can get these ropes off, I'll do my best to take down my share of the guards.
GID00008173	Ring-a-ding-ding, baby. I've got your back.
GID00008174	You fink! Murdering me like this, down on my knees?
GID00008175	That's it, baby! Time to vacate these premises!
GID00008176	Baby, you can't just leave me tied up! Those Legion boys'll hoist me up on a cross for the mess you made - if I'm lucky!
GID00008177	Baby, that can go any direction you want. We can take Vegas together, or I can head for the nearest sunset. Your call.
GID00008178	Thanks for nothing, you fink!
GID00008179	What ya talking about? I been ready!
GID00008180	That's it, baby! Show these punks what you got!
GID00008181	Groovy, baby! Plant these losers in the ground!
GID00008182	That's it - sock it to the Legion, baby!
GID00008183	Keep it up! Show these finks what's what!
GID00008184	They got nothing on you, baby! Keep it up!
GID00008185	Yeah! Give these Praetorian bums the big send-off, baby!
GID00008186	I sure do, but loose lips sink ships.
GID00008187	[SUCCEEDED] Alright, you look pretty trustworthy.
GID00008188	[FAILED] Sorry, but the Omertas don't look very kindly upon gossiping.
GID00008189	I... well, since you ask so nicely, and I'm not sure I could resist those pretty eyes. What do you want to know?
GID00008190	I've heard some pretty shady rumors about the Ultra Luxe.
GID00008191	I'm not sure what the deal is, but although they try to put on airs, that place is just plain creepy. Maybe it's the masks.
GID00008192	Not much of a rumor, but I hear the Tops is always looking for new talent. Lord knows they've needed it for a long time.
GID00008193	I'm not sure what's going on at Lucky 38. That place is weird. Nobody ever goes in. Nobody ever comes out.
GID00008194	I hear you've actually been inside Lucky 38? You're the first person who's been in there in as long as anybody can remember.
GID00008195	It's hard to believe that not too long ago most of the families on the Strip were little more than warring tribes.
GID00008196	The Omertas even had a big war with the Khans, once upon a time.
GID00008197	Sorry, that's all the news worth talking about. All I have at least.
GID00008198	Gossip is one thing, dirt on the Family is something else totally.
GID00008199	I knew someone would call in that mark soon. What do you want to know?
GID00008200	That was one of my sisters, but my family always repays our debts. What do you want to know?
GID00008201	Depends on who you're looking for.
GID00008202	Cachino is usually on this floor in Brimstone, having drinks. If he isn't there then he's probably in his room upstairs.
GID00008203	Troike spends all his days down in Zoara on the lower level.
GID00008204	Troike is dead, but I'm sure you know that.
GID00008205	Yeah. I know him. You'll probably find him in his room upstairs. He usually just sends down for girls or food.
GID00008206	I knew someone named Clanden. Good fucking riddance.
GID00008207	Big Sal and Nero split their time in Zoara overlooking the main casino floor from the balcony. No one but Family is allowed up there, though.
GID00008208	All I can tell you is to find Cachino. He's the lowest level Lieutenant you're going to be able to talk to.
GID00008209	Some of the girls say he's been involved in some shady business the Family wouldn't really like. Ask him about it.
GID00008210	Sorry, they don't tell me their plans and I don't want to know. I'm just happy they don't make me fuck anybody anymore.
GID00008211	Fire away.
GID00008212	Enjoy yourself.
GID00008213	Be careful.
GID00008214	And here I thought us Great Khans were tough to kill. So, what happens now?
GID00008215	Yeah... about that...
GID00008216	Yeah? On what?
GID00008217	He's one of the Chairmen, big shots who run The Tops casino in New Vegas. A friend from the city contacted me with info on a big job.
GID00008218	I should've known that the caps were too good to be true, but there was still no way I could pass up the chance.
GID00008219	Fine.
GID00008220	And face NCR "justice?" No thanks. I'd rather not spend the next ten years doing hard labor.
GID00008221	Just a big, fancy poker chip as far as I know. Don't know why anyone would make one out of platinum, though.
GID00008222	We'd try to bribe our way out, but seeing as how Benny didn't pay us yet, that won't happen.
GID00008223	He's a snake, that's why. He owed us the rest of the pay for the job, so maybe he didn't want to pay up.
GID00008224	[SUCCEEDED] I can't believe I'm doing this, but all right, the hostages can go. The NCR had better keep their end of the deal, though.
GID00008225	Here - a souvenir for you. It's Benny's lighter. Shove it up his ass when you catch up with him.
GID00008226	[FAILED] Right, and they'd probably give us all medals, too. Maybe I should kill a hostage because you wasted my time with this shit.
GID00008227	All right, quit fucking around. You survived and you tracked us down. What now?
GID00008228	You mean... just let them go? How would I explain this to my superiors?
GID00008229	I've been thinking about it since you brought it up earlier. 500 caps would go a long way for some soldier's families.
GID00008230	500 caps would go a long way for some soldier's families.
GID00008231	Right.
GID00008232	This doesn't feel quite right, but it resolves things and gets my troopers back in one piece.
GID00008233	All right.
GID00008234	[SUCCEEDED] That makes sense, and it's still more than these troopers see in a month.
GID00008235	[FAILED] You're asking me to accept a bribe. I'd like to make sure the risk to my career - and freedom - benefits the families of my troops.
GID00008236	This doesn't feel quite right, but it resolves things and gets my troopers back in one piece.
GID00008237	500 caps was the amount requested.
GID00008238	We agreed on 400 caps.
GID00008239	You're right. The Great Khans are free to go.
GID00008240	I don't like it, but orders are orders.
GID00008241	Ah, excellent. I received word you may be coming. We helped the receptionist over at Gomorrah with some thugs that were taking advantage of her.
GID00008242	She owes us a favor. Go talk to her, she'll be able to point you in the right direction.
GID00008243	Later.
GID00008244	Ranger Station Alpha. Ranger Lineholm is in command here.
GID00008245	I'm not really much of a historian. The short version is that the Rangers are the elite of the NCR military. Best fighters in the wasteland.
GID00008246	For about ten years now. Toughest training I've ever done, and was the proudest day of my life when I got my Ranger badge.
GID00008247	Did you know that the first battle at Hoover Dam was won because of the Rangers? Legion had the numbers, but we had the skill.
GID00008248	Sure.
GID00008249	Couple dozen, I'd say, most of them posted at stations like this one. We either man the station or patrol the immediate area.
GID00008250	The Rangers mostly draw from the basic NCR army. A trooper who shows exceptional skill at fighting and scouting can be nominated for the training.
GID00008251	Goodbye.
GID00008252	Forgive my challenge. I'll take you to my Decanus at once.
GID00008253	Ah - you must be the courier who's been of service to us lately. I'll take you to my Decanus at once.
GID00008254	<Brothers! Attack!>
GID00008255	Brothers! Attack!
GID00008256	Brothers, help!
GID00008257	The Legion will decide that, Profligate, not you. Will you go before my Decanus for judgement, or be killed where you stand?
GID00008258	Follow me. Make any trouble, and you'll wind up on a cross - if you're lucky.
GID00008259	My commander, you ignorant degenerate! Now, will you go before Dead Sea?
GID00008260	Brothers, help!
GID00008261	Let's be straight, baby: there's lucky and there's *too* lucky. You keep up like this and you're gonna break the bank.
GID00008262	Now, we're happy to have you come on in and spend some dough at the bar, take in a show, whatever - but you're cut off from the games.
GID00008263	Smart move, kid. We're happy to have you come on in and spend some dough at the bar, take in a show, whatever - but you're cut off from the games.
GID00008264	Fine, then, you want to play rough? We'll play rough!
GID00008265	Jesus Christ!
GID00008266	You're free to enjoy the shows and the bar, but no more games for you at The Tops. Thanks for playing.
GID00008267	You've taken us for a ride, and we want you out.
GID00008268	All right, come back any time.
GID00008269	Have you ever heard the story of the bomber that crashed into the lake before the War? Supposedly it's mostly intact, even after all that time.
GID00008270	I'm in charge of the radio - hence the title "Comm Officer." I'd much rather be out on patrol, since nothing much happens around here.
GID00008271	Mission accomplished, asshole. I never would've suspected a thing if you hadn't told me - but now I'll have to have you killed.
GID00008272	And you fell for that? Really? Because I'm going to have you killed now.
GID00008273	You do know why I wanted to meet you, right?
GID00008274	A man nearly kills you, so you track him across the breadth of the Mojave?
GID00008275	You arrive on the Strip and waltz into the Lucky 38 like someone left you a key under the doormat?
GID00008276	You assassinate the head of the Chairmen in his own casino - and get away with it?
GID00008277	You visit the Tops, and next thing you know, the head of the Chairmen is fleeing the Strip like a whimpering little pup?
GID00008278	Then something happens to Mr. House's robots - some kind of military upgrade?
GID00008279	But the topper, the coup de grace? Mr. House dies - while you're visiting him at the Lucky 38.
GID00008280	When you set your mind to something, you get results. I like that.
GID00008281	...Relax. I'm fucking with you.
GID00008282	We'll deal with Benny when the time comes. In the meantime...
GID00008283	We'll talk about the Platinum Chip when the time comes. In the meantime...
GID00008284	Maybe I should have you struck blind so my face is the last sight you ever behold. Look...
GID00008285	Praetorians, to arms!
GID00008286	Praetorians, to me!
GID00008287	Vulpes Inculta, the best of my frumentarii, is dead.
GID00008288	All the bribes I sent to the Omertas ended up buying me nothing.
GID00008289	The Great Khans aren't exactly clamoring to fight for my Legion now.
GID00008290	The garrison I established at Nelson has been wiped out.
GID00008291	Years of meticulous scheming to place a mole at Camp McCarran - wasted.
GID00008292	The Kings of Freeside are cooperating with the NCR now, which frees up soldiers to defend the dam.
GID00008293	You even disrupted a promising weapons deal with the Van Graffs.
GID00008294	Is it any wonder my Legion has so little love for you?
GID00008295	So tell me this, because I really want to know. I am feared - with good reason.
GID00008296	But you - of all people - dare to come here and stand before me, the mighty Caesar. What were you thinking?
GID00008297	You spread word of the massacre of Nipton, just like Vulpes asked you.
GID00008298	Beams of light shot down from the sky over HELIOS One, killing who knows how many Profligate troops.
GID00008299	Silus, the Centurion who let himself get captured, died at McCarran before he could reveal sensitive information.
GID00008300	You freed the Centurion Silus from McCarran so that he might be punished for his cowardice.
GID00008301	The monorail that the Profligates rode from McCarran to the Strip has been destroyed.
GID00008302	You turned Camp Forlorn Hope into a mass grave.
GID00008303	Chief Hanlon, a nemesis of my Legion, died the humiliating death he deserved.
GID00008304	In Boulder City, you let the renegade Khans go free, but left NCR troopers gurgling on the ground, drowning in their own blood.
GID00008305	A number of NCR Ranger stations have been wiped off the face of the Mojave, thanks to you.
GID00008306	The Profligates still hate me more than they hate you, I think, but I've been at this longer than you have.
GID00008307	I get it. We share a common enemy. And now you come before the mighty Caesar to what - offer your services?
GID00008308	I have eyes and ears everywhere. It behooves me not to invade the west blind and deaf.
GID00008309	It hasn't been hard to track your progress. It's not as though you've been keeping a low profile.
GID00008310	Benny's theory, if I understood it through all the screaming, was that Mr. House stashed some kind of ultimate weapon down there.
GID00008311	A gigantic robot to stomp us all to death, who cares? Whatever it is, House built it, so I want it destroyed.
GID00008312	I don't know. And I don't like not knowing.
GID00008313	I know Mr. House built it. I'm thinking it's probably some kind of weapon that he can't activate from a distance.
GID00008314	I like the servile attitude. Keep it up.
GID00008315	The time is fast approaching when my Legion will assault the great dam and invade the west.
GID00008316	Before that happens, I want Mr. House knocked out of the game, a quick one-two punch - with you doing the punching.
GID00008317	Before that happens, I want Mr. House erased from the picture. Not just the man you killed, but what he left behind. His legacy.
GID00008318	Yes. But then I'd have to kill them.
GID00008319	I wouldn't trust Benny to lick my boots clean. This one falls to you.
GID00008320	You don't get it, do you? The weapons I wield are forged from blood, flesh, sinew, bone - mortal stuff. Fragile, even.
GID00008321	And yet my Legion obeys me, even unto death. Why? Because they live to serve the greater good, and they know of no alternatives.
GID00008322	House's machines, his technologies - what do they propose? The possibility of victory without sacrifice. No blood spilled, just... rivets.
GID00008323	That's not an idea to be put in circulation. If mankind's going to survive this moment in history, it needs warriors, not gadgets.
GID00008324	The Boomers settled at the old air base northeast of Vegas many years ago. No one knows exactly how long it's been.
GID00008325	It may be that no one's traded with them or even spoken to them that entire time. If so, they're sitting on one hell of a stockpile of ammunition...
GID00008326	My scouts have seen people moving around the base. The perimeter is guarded, with spotters in towers directing the artillery fire.
GID00008327	They must have extraordinary vision. Some of my scouts were targeted at extreme distances.
GID00008328	So no, I can't tell you what to expect inside the base. No one's been inside it, except them.
GID00008329	The worst impulses of mankind, concentrated in one insane, backward tribe.
GID00008330	The Brotherhood seems to have formed not long after the great atomic war. It's hard to know - they care little for history.
GID00008331	Some of the Brotherhood scribes we captured further East didn't even know the name of their founder, Roger Maxson.
GID00008332	They like to pretty up their mission with trappings of chivalry, but the truth is they're horders. They horde technology.
GID00008333	It's been 200 years, and they still have the mentality of scavengers. They say they're preserving these technologies, but for what?
GID00008334	They have no vision. They offer no future. They're a dead end.
GID00008335	You don't think very far ahead, do you?
GID00008336	Sure, their hatred of the NCR would seem to qualify them for use as proxies. But then what do you do with them? Each paladin is quite powerful.
GID00008337	I'd have to be convinced that present benefits outweighed future costs.
GID00008338	A man of potential, held back by the craven political context he inhabits. You realize he was a general? "The Hero of the Mojave," they called him.
GID00008339	A title he earned by extirpating lesser tribes that dared attack NCR citizens. His responses were swift and draconian.
GID00008340	President Tandi, the "founding mother," coddled hostile tribes... but her successors were less naive, so they gave Kimball free rein.
GID00008341	And after a respectable military career, what does he do? Become a politician.
GID00008342	But he did so by election. What better way to stunt the growth of leaders, not to mention whole cultures?
GID00008343	A leader shouldn't have to kowtow to those who serve him. With so much energy wasted on those below, how is he ever to move forward?
GID00008344	Had he taken the government by force, used his army to stage a coup, things would be very different.
GID00008345	I'll just have to do it for him.
GID00008346	It'll frighten them. If I can reach out and kill whomever I choose, then they know the only reason they're alive is I haven't tried yet.
GID00008347	You have to understand that Kimball is a symbol. Without him, there would be no NCR occupation of the Mojave.
GID00008348	He mustered the troops - as many as his senate would allow - and sent them in. All the right reasons, done all the wrong ways.
GID00008349	Any invasion by a democracy is a half-measure. When Kimball dies, the NCR will recoil from the Mojave, and from his legacy.
GID00008350	By the time they recover and try to strike back, I'll be invading them.
GID00008351	Lanius is the greatest of my battlefield commanders. Some might call him a great man, but I'm not sure he qualifies.
GID00008352	Once, he was the greatest warrior of the Hidebarks, a tribe of the Arizona. Maniacal in battle. Sometimes he'd ambush Legion patrols by himself.
GID00008353	When, after several months we found and surrounded the Hidebarks' camp, their Chieftain raised a banner of surrender.
GID00008354	The warrior who was not yet Lanius went insane with rage. He struck down his Chieftain and attacked his own tribe.
GID00008355	He killed fifteen before they brought him down. He didn't die, obviously.
GID00008356	I had him tended to. He was maimed, most of face torn off. It was days before he regained consciousness.
GID00008357	When he did, I went to his bedside and showed him the helmet I'd had forged to cover his face. I said he could have it if he'd fight for me.
GID00008358	He accepted... on condition that he be allowed to kill the surviving males of his tribe. I said, make it the adult males and you have a deal.
GID00008359	Lanius is savage. Savagely loyal, too, but only to me - he has no love for my Legion. But this has its uses.
GID00008360	He has no attachment to his men, no compunction about battlefield losses. All he cares about is destroying the enemy.
GID00008361	When another legatus or a Centurion fails to achieve results, I send Lanius to make things right.
GID00008362	His first step is to beat the failed commander to death in front of his assembled troops. Then he orders the ritual of decimatio.
GID00008363	It means "decimation," but in ancient Rome the word had a very specific meaning - a punishment for cowardice.
GID00008364	The Legionaries are lined up in ranks. Every tenth man steps forward and is beaten to death by his brothers.
GID00008365	It instills a certain... robust obedience.
GID00008366	Yes. This time my Legionaries will be more frightened of the commander behind them than the enemy before them.
GID00008367	There will be no failure this time, no retreat, no years of gathering slaves and resources for another assault.
GID00008368	With Lanius to drive the Legion forward, the dam will be taken. It will be our bridgehead across the Colorado.
GID00008369	It's not going to happen again. That's all I have to say about it.
GID00008370	And I've heard it's a bad idea to tempt the wrath of Caesar. Change the subject.
GID00008371	Vulpes is the best of my Frumentarii. A remarkable individual from an unremarkable tribe south of the Utah.
GID00008372	He was brought into the Legion as a boy, survived training, fought well enough as Legionary to be promoted to the rank of Decanus.
GID00008373	Then, in battle against an unimportant tribe, he broke ranks and led his contubernium through a hole in their defenses to capture its chieftain.
GID00008374	Well, his Centurion wanted him crucified for disobedience. So I made him a Frumentari.
GID00008375	Whatever I require. Infiltration, assassination, dramatic atrocities to break the spirit of the enemy - et cetera.
GID00008376	They're mentally flexible. They operate behind enemy lines for extended periods, imitating the enemy's customs without becoming sullied.
GID00008377	In all these things, Vulpes is a master.
GID00008378	My Praetorians embody the martial ideals of my Legion. Each one of them has done enough conquering and killing to deserve the rank of Centurion.
GID00008379	Instead, I invited them to join my guard. So the invitee chooses whichever current guard he thinks is weakest - and challenges him.
GID00008380	The fight is to the death. It keeps them from getting complacent.
GID00008381	Lucius has been the head of my guard for five years now. He was a subordinate guard for eight before that.
GID00008382	No invitee has dared to challenge him yet. Maybe it's an issue of respect - he is getting on in years.
GID00008383	Lanius will be waiting for you. Your arrival will signal to him that it's time to launch the attack.
GID00008384	As for what to expect, it's going to be the greatest battle - and victory - mankind has seen since it almost wiped itself off the face of this Earth.
GID00008385	Tactically, it's simple - kill and kill some more. I may have a few surprises in store for the NCR, but that won't concern you.
GID00008386	Because he complicates the equation of force. He's a free agent, an unpredictable element.
GID00008387	I'm sure he's trying to sit out this battle, just as he did four years ago, hoping the Legion and Profligates will wipe each other out.
GID00008388	When he sees the Profligates losing this battle, however, he might throw his support behind them. Except he won't, because he'll be dead.
GID00008389	Mark my words, you piece of shit. This is the last time you will ever refuse to perform an order I've given you.
GID00008390	If you meant what you said, you best be on your way, and at good speed. And forget all that I could have given you.
GID00008391	If you ever - ever - disobey me again, I will order my Praetorians to hack you to death with their machetes for my entertainment.
GID00008392	I warned you about the price of disobedience. I guess you weren't listening.
GID00008393	Praetorians! Kill this nuisance!
GID00008394	Months spent feeding the Omertas bribes, nursing their betrayal - all for nothing. Any other crimes?
GID00008395	Weeks of effort to convince those miserable Khans to join the Legion - ruined. Any other crimes?
GID00008396	And so you wiped out the garrison I placed at Nelson? That strategically vital garrison? What else?
GID00008397	Do you have any idea how much effort it took to place a mole at Camp McCarran? What else have you done?
GID00008398	Understand this. From this moment forward, any other crimes will be punished by death. No exceptions.
GID00008399	I will have you hacked into pieces by my Praetorians - for my amusement. Understand?
GID00008400	Now getting back to business...
GID00008401	That's right. Under normal circumstances, the reason it wouldn't happen again is that you'd be crucified - or worse.
GID00008402	Only in light of the extraordinary service you've rendered unto me am I going to overlook this failure.
GID00008403	Bear in mind how much you have to make up for, how much you have to prove yourself in your next task...
GID00008404	What else, then?
GID00008405	What did you just say?
GID00008406	Benny is my prisoner. You don't "deal with him" unless you've dealt with me.
GID00008407	Don't worry, you'll get the Platinum Chip he was carrying. And then you'll use it like I tell you to.
GID00008408	You should be listening, that's what you should be doing.
GID00008409	That's right, you should be going - because you have work to do.
GID00008410	Oh, I'll give you the Platinum Chip. And then you'll use it exactly like I tell you to.
GID00008411	Here's your chip. Is there anything else I can help you with?
GID00008412	Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
GID00008413	Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
GID00008414	Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
GID00008415	Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
GID00008416	Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
GID00008417	Is there anything else I can help you with?
GID00008418	Believe me, I would love orders to take Cottonwood Cove apart and kick the Legion back across the river.
GID00008419	But, the brass at McCarran doesn't want us to waste resources on something they consider a minor target. So we just get to watch.
GID00008420	Undoubtedly. Rangers are tough nuts to crack, though, and any force small enough to launch a surprise attack isn't going back in one piece.
GID00008421	On the other hand, if the Legion goes for a full-scale attack, we'll see 'em coming, fall back, and wait for reinforcements.
GID00008422	So, we know what they'll do and they know what we'll do, so we just sit around and keep an eye on each other.
GID00008423	The Legion's been sending raiding parties across the river in larger numbers lately. We don't have the men at this post to intercept them all.
GID00008424	Skirmishes, mostly. The Legion raiding parties usually fall back when they know it's us they're up against.
GID00008425	Be careful out there.
GID00008426	Watch out for Great Khans.
GID00008427	Yes.
GID00008428	[SUCCEEDED] We were on patrol near the Dam when a Legion raiding party jumped us. Didn't even have to time to radio it in.
GID00008429	I was hit in the head with a machete and knocked out. Didn't kill me, though some nights I wish it had. When I woke up, my nerve was gone.
GID00008430	The rest of my squad was crucified, butchered, mutilated. I don't know how they missed me. Maybe they didn't. Maybe they knew they'd broken me.
GID00008431	I gambled and drank a lot after that. Got into trouble, but the Rangers gave me a second chance instead of kicking me out. So, here I am.
GID00008432	[FAILED] No, I'm not going to bring it up.
GID00008433	Maybe. But, thanks for saying it, anyway.
GID00008434	Yeah.
GID00008435	I... I was different back then.
GID00008436	Are you... going to spank us? I *so* love handcuffs!
GID00008437	Come on, big man, roll up in here!
GID00008438	Check your weapons and move up!
GID00008439	Move up to the next position.
GID00008440	All clear!
GID00008441	Zone clear! Advance to the next position.
GID00008442	That looks like all of them.
GID00008443	I think it is safe to move up.
GID00008444	Keep your heads down and move up to the next location.
GID00008445	Looks like we got them, move fast and look alive.
GID00008446	WooooOOOOOOoooo.
GID00008447	You're no friend to the Great Khans. You should turn around and leave - and if we see you in the Mojave, well... accidents happen.
GID00008448	Uhh, hey. Welcome to Red Rock Canyon. You've seemed a little bipolar lately - maybe you're having withdrawal symptoms?
GID00008449	Talk to Jack, he'd be happy to sell you some top-quality chems. He'll even give you a discount.
GID00008450	Hey, welcome to Red Rock Canyon! Since you've done so much for the Great Khans, Papa Khan told me to let you know you can buy weapons at our Armory.
GID00008451	You can find it in the basement of the burned-out old building at the mouth of the canyon.
GID00008452	Crocker. Can. Kiss. My. Sweet. Republic. Ass.
GID00008453	Where's your sexy friend, Vic?!
GID00008454	Hellloooo, sparky.
GID00008455	Who wants to swim? Water's fiiiiine.
GID00008456	Uh oooooh, it's the *law,* girls!
GID00008457	All right, ladies, show's over.
GID00008458	All right, girls, show's over.
GID00008459	Take it on home.
GID00008460	Want to dance, hit Gomorrah.
GID00008461	All right, enough fun for tonight.
GID00008462	Get out. Get out.
GID00008463	Ladies, please remove yourselves from the fountain.
GID00008464	Please remove yourselves from the fountain.
GID00008465	And gather your clothes and belongings.
GID00008466	Ladies, please disperse.
GID00008467	Please disperse.
GID00008468	Ladies, the fountain is a restricted area.
GID00008469	The fountain is a restricted area.
GID00008470	Ladies, if you wish to bathe, please check into the Ultra-Luxe.
GID00008471	The fountain is for wishes, ladies.
GID00008472	Please remove your bra from the bottom of the fountain.
GID00008473	The bathhouse is in the Ultra-Luxe.
GID00008474	Can barely see the street.
GID00008475	Those last five shots were a bad idea...
GID00008476	Why do they call it a monorail... it's a train. A *train.*
GID00008477	Why's everything spinning?
GID00008478	I swear the monorail was *just* ahead... somewhere.
GID00008479	So fucked up I can't feel my legs.
GID00008480	We need to stop and pee soon.
GID00008481	I got a pressure in me like Hoover Dam.
GID00008482	Is there a place to grab food by the monorail?
GID00008483	What, we leaving *already?*
GID00008484	Can't believe we have patrol duty in the morning...
GID00008485	I swear... I'm not drinking... ever... again.
GID00008486	That's it, keep moving.
GID00008487	Have half a mind to throw you all in a cell and let you sweat it off.
GID00008488	Going to have words with your commanding officer after this.
GID00008489	Come on, come on.
GID00008490	Don't have the patience for this drunk escort shit tonight...
GID00008491	Don't give us any trouble now.
GID00008492	Monorail's just ahead, boys, keep moving.
GID00008493	Stand tall and walk straight, you idiots are giving us a bad name.
GID00008494	Look alive, guys, you're on NCR time.
GID00008495	Uh... I was just... uh... getting some fresh air and stretching my legs. It's getting pretty late though, I should get going. Goodnight.
GID00008496	Yeah, yeah... me too. It's getting a bit late though, I should get going. Goodnight.
GID00008497	I'm not sneaking! I'm uh... just stretching my legs. I should be getting back though, it's late. Goodnight.
GID00008498	Nothing as severe. Charlie seems to be getting a lot of extra medical supplies for some reason, while Bravo hasn't requested a resupply in awhile.
GID00008499	Echo has been reporting heavy Legion activity down on their end, but that's about it.
GID00008500	Oh. Well, thanks for helping get to the bottom of this, I guess.
GID00008501	No confession? No evidence? What good is that?
GID00008502	I'm sure the assassins will wait for you to show up.
GID00008503	You're making me question your usefulness, you realize.
GID00008504	Success depends on forethought, dispassionate calculation of probabilites, accounting for every stray variable.
GID00008505	Your history of aggression towards the NCR has rendered you useless in this concern, unable to influence the outcome of events.
GID00008506	Consequently, I have to "wait and see" what happens. It's... grotesque.
GID00008507	I'll send a Securitron ahead to meet with the NCR at the security checkpoint and get things started.
GID00008508	Once you get there ask for Ranger Grant. I've used roaming Securitrons to feed him useful information in the past.
GID00008509	If I tell him we've heard of a Legion assassination plot, I believe he'll let you investigate.
GID00008510	This is not an optional assignment. Kimball may be a grandstanding boor, but I want him protected.
GID00008511	Until you do this, consider yourself suspended... without pay.
GID00008512	See you around.
GID00008513	So long.
GID00008514	See you around.
GID00008515	Yeah.
GID00008516	Carry on.
GID00008517	I don't like the sound of this. Hope that collar isn't what I think it is. What did you do, Elijah?
GID00008518	It pays like ass, but it's hard to get other work with my skill set.
GID00008519	What do you want to know?
GID00008520	Ha! Good question. These days it's hard to say. Once upon a time it was about technology. Controlling it so it couldn't destroy us again.
GID00008521	Energy weapons and power armor are usually tops on our list, although I appreciate anything that's vintage.
GID00008522	But that all seems so limited now. We haven't grown or adapted. And now we're stuck in a hole, not carrying out our mission.
GID00008523	More sexual favors than I can even count. I am still tired from it.
GID00008524	No, actually, you're born into it. My parents, their parents, so on. When you're young you can choose to leave. But it's home, so most people don't.
GID00008525	We don't take on new members, really. You can do the math on our long-term prospects based on that point. I keep hoping we'll change that.
GID00008526	I'm a procurement specialist. Like I said, it's basically grocery shopping. Except sometimes the groceries are scavenged parts and arcane technology.
GID00008527	The elder who brought us to the Mojave, Father Elijah, usually had me looking for these old memory units. But he'd never tell me what they were for.
GID00008528	Nowadays I'm usually sent to do business with traders at places like the 188. But sometimes I think it's just to keep me out of everyone's hair.
GID00008529	I know sometimes I sound like I don't. I know. But there's something that still rings true to me about our code.
GID00008530	There's an honor to it. We're protecting people. Even if it's from themselves, it's a good cause.
GID00008531	We just lose sight of the big picture sometimes. Treat all our practices with the same sacredness.
GID00008532	Ah, the Codex. If it's in there, we have to abide it, if it's not, it's not important.
GID00008533	It documents our history, too. Part of what Scribes like me do is update it. Hmm... I wonder...
GID00008534	Nah, they'd probably catch it if I rewrote the Founder's axioms.
GID00008535	No, no. We only protect people from themselves, and only in the sense that we don't let them have the really good Pre-War toys.
GID00008536	And sometimes it's more like we protect ourselves from them and hope to outlive them and become humanity's sole heirs.
GID00008537	We've had people go rogue, though, and start helping people. One chapter had a small civil war over it. We take our isolationism seriously.
GID00008538	I called them family before. That's not far off. Both the good and the bad. It's like a big unending family reunion in that bunker.
GID00008539	There's people you love, people you'll never speak to again, and it's always awkward when you run into someone you used to date.
GID00008540	He was our Elder when we came East. A wizard with technology, really. His mind just worked that way naturally. Learned a lot from him.
GID00008541	But he started having disagreements with the other Elders. The Brotherhood's interest is in old technology. He wanted to explore developing new tech.
GID00008542	And there were other ways he wanted to push. Other weapons. Ones with ethics questions attached. Rather than deal with him, they sent him East.
GID00008543	I like punching things, but sometimes shooting things just has to do.
GID00008544	Shoot.
GID00008545	What are your thoughts?
GID00008546	Okay, I won't!
GID00008547	Okay, well... I guess I'll just keep waiting. Sorry to bother you.
GID00008548	He isn't. I already checked there this morning. We were supposed to meet up here about an hour ago.
GID00008549	I guess I'll just keep waiting. Sorry to bother you.
GID00008550	Why would you say something like that? That's just mean.
GID00008551	Just leave me alone.
GID00008552	That shot came from the Chief's office!
GID00008553	Chief! Why did you do it?
GID00008554	Don't get killed out there.
GID00008555	So long.
GID00008556	Ranger Station Alpha used to be the frontline outpost for NCR. When we moved onto the Dam, this station has fallen into more a support role.
GID00008557	There are other Ranger posts around. Reyes might have mixed up the report.
GID00008558	Reyes got the numbers wrong - not much more to it than that.
GID00008559	Careful out there.
GID00008560	All right.
GID00008561	You think I haven't tried? Every time I do, Camp Golf acknowledges the situation. And soon after that, more ammo.
GID00008562	We're not going to die of thirst any time soon, but I'd rather have too much than not enough.
GID00008563	Eh, it's not my call to make. You'd have to clear it with Ranger Ericsen.
GID00008564	Bye.
GID00008565	The security codes are unique to the radios at each Ranger station. They're useless anywhere else.
GID00008566	This holotape contains the updated security codes for the Ranger Stations. Show it to the comm officers there.
GID00008567	Once the new codes are in use, anyone still using the old codes will just hear static if they're listening in on our frequencies.
GID00008568	Thank you, and good luck.
GID00008569	All right, then. Come and talk to me when you do.
GID00008570	I knew it. Every one of the false reports was signed off by Chief Hanlon at Camp Golf, but why would the Chief manipulate the reports?
GID00008571	I need you to take everything we've found to Chief Hanlon and confront him with it. I don't want to make this public unless we have to.
GID00008572	I knew it. I suspected that Chief Hanlon was behind all this, but since he's dead, there's no way we'll ever know.
GID00008573	Thanks for all your help.
GID00008574	I saw some Legion assholes carrying crates to a cave north of here. May have been NCR shit, I don't fucking know.
GID00008584	I am a loyal servant of Caesar, and I thank my good fortune for the day that he plucked me as a babe from the shore of the Great Salt Lake.
GID00008585	For five years I have had the privilege of serving as a Decanus. If fortune continues to smile upon me, I will serve him until I draw my last breath.
GID00008586	I hope that satisfies your curiosity about me, because I won't waste any more of Caesar's time talking about myself.
GID00008587	I'll execute Caesar's will by hurling your corpse into the Colorado - like the other Profligates before you!
GID00008588	I am Dead Sea, Decanus of the Legion by the grace of Caesar, not that you're in any position to ask questions.
GID00008589	True to Caesar.
GID00008590	All right, you're clean. Come back by here when you're done at the tables.
GID00008591	[FAILED] Nice try, wiseass. Now hand everything over before you make a *second* mistake.
GID00008592	[FAILED] Oh, now, what surprise - someone trying to smuggle in weapons.
GID00008593	Look, jackass, the job's rough enough as it is without troublemakers like you, so either hand it all over or take your caps elsewhere.
GID00008594	You just made a big mistake.
GID00008595	Things guards can't spot when they're patting you down or checking for iron at your hip.
GID00008596	Simple - you can't bring guns into the casino, that's why. They'll strip you to your fists.
GID00008597	Surrre, they say you get it all back when you leave. Me? I don't like being without a little *insurance* when it's my caps on the table.
GID00008598	Take a look at these beauties.
GID00008599	The right weapons for my kind of customer.
GID00008600	The others here don't understand our kind, but you can count of me, friend.
GID00008601	You aren't exactly good for business, so you'll have to live with my prices.
GID00008602	Have a discount, friend. I can't wait to see what you do with these, next.
GID00008603	It's an honor to have my wares used by such a wild badass. Cut's on the house, friend.
GID00008604	Suit yourself, it's not my fault if they find your body dumped in Freeside.
GID00008605	Stay safe.
GID00008606	You know where to find me, friend.
GID00008607	Make yourself scarce, I got to keep my image.
GID00008608	Bring on the mayhem, friend.
GID00008609	[SUCCEEDED] You might - one fellow I knew was able to slip a pistol past the guards. You? I'm guessing you could get a machine gun by them.
GID00008610	[FAILED] An experienced smuggler could get a machine gun or pistol in - you? You're welcome to try.
GID00008611	What would you like to know?
GID00008612	People have been counterfeiting bottle caps forever, but it's always been small scale.
GID00008613	A bottle cap press is a whole other threat. We can't have anyone devaluing our currency by mass producing new bottle caps.
GID00008614	Certainly. Bottle caps do wear out or get damaged. Some people even insist on using bottle caps in explosive devices for some reason.
GID00008615	We make it a point to scour Pre-War bottling plants and recover or disable the bottle cap presses. It seems we missed one.
GID00008616	Lots of little things - the paint on the label, the machining, the type of metal it's made from.
GID00008617	I know there's counterfeit caps floating around, of course. Fortunately, they're very time-consuming to make, so the numbers are small.
GID00008618	All right. Sit still and let me work.
GID00008619	I'm afraid I can't do this for free. My supplies are stretched thin enough as it is.
GID00008620	Very Well. You may proceed. However, be warned. Aggressive acts will earn you a place on a cross.
GID00008621	I'll expect to see some tangible progress before long, then.
GID00008622	I'm the person who will pay you when you complete the delivery contract you signed. Now go get the Chip.
GID00008623	Excellent idea.
GID00008624	By "goodbye," I assume you mean to say that you can't talk right now because you need to go get the Platinum Chip off Benny's body.
GID00008625	There will time for questions and answers once you've delivered the Chip. Until then, you'll have to tolerate your ignorance... just as I do.
GID00008626	His destination is hardly a mystery. It's a near certainty that he's making his way for Caesar's camp, at Fortification Hill.
GID00008627	It's one of just two places on Earth that have the hardware necessary to read the Platinum Chip - the Lucky 38 is the other, of course.
GID00008628	And whose idea was it to offer yourself up as a sacrificial lamb? Really, what did you expect?
GID00008629	Are you going to keep giving him opportunities to kill you? It's becoming a hobby of his.
GID00008630	I suspected he'd found a way to access my encrypted databases, but well - this explains it.
GID00008631	That would be how he learned of the Platinum Chip in the first place... not to mention where to intercept you, on your way in.
GID00008632	Highly resourceful, Benny. He would've made a fine agent, had he stayed loyal. It's fortunate you came along to replace him - and ironic.
GID00008633	As I've told you before, you are contractually obligated to deliver the Chip. Do your job - you have everything to gain.
GID00008634	I won't lie to you. It'll be dangerous.
GID00008635	What about him? He has every reason to go to the Fort, so that's where you'll find him.
GID00008636	All I ask is that you recover the Chip. What happens to Benny is up to you.
GID00008637	Come back when you have something to report.
GID00008638	And why would you have done that?
GID00008639	Success depends on forcing the NCR to rout from Hoover Dam. Hmm, does giving then a powerful ally in the battle make that more or less likely?
GID00008640	Your assignment is unchanged - destroy the Brotherhood of Steel. Please get it right this time.
GID00008641	Hidden Valley is the place to keep working, then.
GID00008642	They occupied Nellis Air Force Base a little over 50 years ago. One of my Securitrons got some video of their arrival - and then... exploded.
GID00008643	Odds are they were Vault dwellers. That's everything I know about them, really.
GID00008644	Only if you come within a mile or so of them.
GID00008645	Given their history of extreme isolationism, it's tempting to leave them be. But those howitzers of theirs...
GID00008646	You can't let indeterminate variables rattle around in your equations like that. They have to be accounted for, one way or another.
GID00008647	Yes, though at the time they called themselves the "Slither Kin." A vicious clan, not that that's changed, exactly.
GID00008648	They were nomads, capable fighters, but their specialty was betrayal. They'd invite travelers into their yurts, drug them, murder or enslave them.
GID00008649	They took pride in their craft. I don't think Omertas saw other people as people at all. Everyone else was just... prey.
GID00008650	They reminded me of a certain criminal element Vegas used to attract. I told them some stories, gave them some clothes - and they ran with it.
GID00008651	The Chairmen, as we know them now, went by the unfortunate appellation of the "Mojave Boot-Riders." They were nomads, too.
GID00008652	As for the White Glove Society, I afraid I'm contractually obligated not to reveal their original name.
GID00008653	They're a terrorist group, basically. Militant, quasi-religious fanatics obsessed with hoarding Pre-War technology.
GID00008654	Not all technology, mind you. You don't see them raiding hospitals to cart away Auto-Docs or armfuls of prosthetic organs.
GID00008655	No, they greatly prefer the sort of technology that puts people in hospitals. Or graves, rather, since hospitals went the way of the Dodo.
GID00008656	Because they're ridiculous! Because they galavant around the Mojave pretending to be Knights of Yore.
GID00008657	Or did, until the NCR showed them that ideological purity and shiny power armor don't count for much when you're outnumbered 15:1.
GID00008658	The world has no use for emotionally unstable techno-fetishists. Just wipe them out, will you?
GID00008659	I care because he is a known quantity - not the man so much as the political context he inhabits.
GID00008660	Kimball rose to prominence as the "Hero of the Mojave" when he led a campaign of reprisals against tribals who dared to attack NCR citizens.
GID00008661	Ordering the occupation of Hoover Dam was his first act of office. As water and electricity flowed to NCR cities, his popularity soared.
GID00008662	Conversely, his failure to annex the Mojave these seven years, and the immense costs of occupying a foreign land, have eroded his popular support.
GID00008663	Kimball's entire political career is inextricably bound up with the NCR's occupation of the Mojave. It's his war.
GID00008664	If I compell the NCR to retreat, Kimball will be the sacrifice offered to the gods, so decent NCR citizens can get on with their lives.
GID00008665	In retrospect, the Mojave and Hoover Dam will seem like one man's misadventure. Kimball will be blamed, not me. Not New Vegas.
GID00008666	Then the Hero of the Mojave would become the Martyr of Hoover Dam. And when, subsequently, I force the NCR to retreat...
GID00008667	They lick their wounds, and dream of righteous vengeance against New Vegas. Hello, embargo, farewell, tourist economy.
GID00008668	I've calculated and re-calculated these probabilities. Kimball must live.
GID00008669	Imagine two snarling dogs fighting over a curve of bone, perhaps the rib of their master, long-dead.
GID00008670	It'll be a pitched battle, that's a certainty. Perhaps the greatest battle the Earth has seen since the human race nearly made itself extinct.
GID00008671	With Caesar dead, it's hard to know what to expect. The Legate, Lanius, is renowned as a brutal man, not a subtle tactician.
GID00008672	Frontal assaults, wave attacks - these are the sort of tactics one would expect from such a man.
GID00008673	The Legion will mount a ferocious and determined frontal assault from the east, that much is certain.
GID00008674	Still, Caesar is a capable strategist. I'd be surprised if he hasn't found some way to infiltrate the dam, or the NCR's rear areas.
GID00008675	General Oliver's strategy - or "tunnel vision," as I like to call it - has been to mass troops at Hoover Dam.
GID00008676	He wants to out-fight the Legion in a straight-forward slugging match, and then, when they rout, pursue and destroy them in detail.
GID00008677	A crushing, decisive victory of this sort would overshadow the tactical ingenuity of Chief Hanlon's defense four years ago, you see.
GID00008678	A good deal should be obvious to you by now. I won't spoil the rest by talking out of turn.
GID00008679	We do need it. Still, I wish there was something we could give you in return.
GID00008680	Take care of yourself out there. And if you ever need a friendly hand, know that folks around here will always welcome you.
GID00008681	[SUCCEEDED] Yes, I suppose you're right. Please, take this: it's half of our savings. We'll manage, somehow, as we've always done.
GID00008682	Take care of yourself out there. And if you ever need a friendly hand, know that folks around here will always welcome you.
GID00008683	[FAILED] We've worked day and night, for months, to make that much. This is all we can give.
GID00008684	Take care of yourself out there. And if you ever need a friendly hand, know that folks around here will always welcome you.
GID00008685	I shouldn't have trusted you.
GID00008686	You think you can take it? All right, bastard! I'll give you what you deserve!
GID00008687	Goodbye, stranger.
GID00008688	You're going to leave, just like that? All right, stranger... Thank you for everything.
GID00008689	Yes, I suppose you're right. Please, accept half of our reserve. We'll manage, somehow, as we've always done.
GID00008690	... I... I was blind to what was happening in my own family. We don't have much, but please take this.
GID00008691	That's right, get out of here! If I see you ever again, I'll pump you full of lead, you hear?
GID00008692	We do need it, stranger. Still, I wish there was something we could give you in return.
GID00008693	If you see Alice again, please, tell her we won't hold it against her. Tell Alice that we love her.
GID00008694	We've worked day and night, for months, to make that much. Sorry, stranger, it'll have to do.
GID00008695	If you see Alice again, please, tell her we won't hold it against her. Tell Alice that we love her.
GID00008696	If you see Alice again, please, tell her we won't hold it against her. Tell Alice that we love her.
GID00008697	Uh... you were kidding just now when you said that thing about the Codex, right?
GID00008698	Wow. Good thing the safety was on.
GID00008699	Ah, hell. Well, how could you know, right? Okay. Two other options still on the table.
GID00008700	I haven't been anywhere but here for... well, who the hell knows? If there's a corpse I haven't been babysitting it.
GID00008701	But I'll tell you who needs some babysitting. Those damn kids keep running around in here.
GID00008702	They got parents? I don't know. Wish they did so they'd leave me be.
GID00008703	Sorry, but I need it to shoot Stacey. We can find you another gun.
GID00008704	Really? Cool! Bring it back to me when you're done, okay? I think Stacey might be turning into an alien.
GID00008705	I don't really like to go to bed until it gets dark out.
GID00008706	Yeah, it's time for me to sleep now.
GID00008707	Goodnight.
GID00008708	This is the best gun in the whole galaxy. I paid a million caps for it. And it wasn't even brand new.
GID00008709	You mean it? Wow, thanks!
GID00008710	I bet me and Stacey can get something real cool at Mick and Ralph's with that.
GID00008711	Yeah? Let's see it.
GID00008712	Aw, man. It's Stacey's fault. She pretends like she didn't get hit.
GID00008713	That's still a lot of money. I guess I'll take it.
GID00008714	I'll be shooting Stacey till you get back. Just saying goodbye to it, you know?
GID00008715	Sorry, I may be little, but I'm not dumb.
GID00008716	Well, if you can get me most of it, I could give you a loan for the rest.
GID00008717	Sorry, I may be little, but I'm not dumb.
GID00008718	Heh heh heh heh ooo, heh heh heh.
GID00008719	Indeed I have, my articulate friend. Not a few minutes ago I chanced upon a pair of destitute orphans grappling over just such an item.
GID00008720	If you cover the area methodically, I'm quite certain you'll happen upon them with only the most insubstantial of delays.
GID00008721	Be well. And do try and avoid the tragic path of the sot that led me to my present infirmities and spiritual woes.
GID00008722	Kids. Run by sh- shumtimes.
GID00008723	Blaaagghhh.
GID00008724	Kids. Run by sh- shumtimes.
GID00008725	The power station, the dam, they're my babies. Well... don't tell my grandchildren I said that. Anything in here that I haven't rebuilt I've fixed.
GID00008726	I've been here since well before the first battle. I've ground my knuckles on so much cement in here it is nearly as much me as it is cement.
GID00008727	I'm the head engineer. I make sure the turbines keep spinning and the water keeps pumping.
GID00008728	Well he mostly stays out of the way, which is a good thing. He'd probably end up doing some real damage if he tried to make himself useful.
GID00008729	Right now we mostly let him operate the switchboard for the intercom. Flipping switches seems to keep him pretty happy.
GID00008730	Sad what happened to him. He was a good kid.
GID00008731	I was down here for most of it, so I can't tell you much of what the boys with the guns were doing up top.
GID00008732	From talking to the boys that were fighting up there, I can tell you that Hanlon managed to pull off what most people would have thought impossible.
GID00008733	Alright, what's on your mind?
GID00008734	Good day to you, and stay out of trouble.
GID00008735	Been better, been worse. When I first came here there was but one turbine spinning.
GID00008736	At one point shortly after the last battle I had six of them spinning, was a wonderful sound. Only four of them are running right now.
GID00008737	A little bit ago one of the intake towers got clogged. No water running through it anymore to spin the generators.
GID00008738	One of these days I'll get some boys out to the turbine to get it running again, but right now it is pretty low on the priority list.
GID00008739	You've got my ear.
GID00008740	Well to each their own I guess.
GID00008741	What do you need to know?
GID00008742	Goodbye.
GID00008743	Okay. This will just take a moment.
GID00008744	Okay. This will just take a moment.
GID00008745	Okay. This will just take a moment.
GID00008746	Contreras?! What's his involvement? Was he selling drugs to Price?
GID00008747	Sounds like the evidence we need to bring him in for questioning and search his shack, but why are you telling me all of this?
GID00008748	Well, thanks for the tip, but we'll need more evidence. Talk to Boyd at McCarran.
GID00008749	I've been working with her in this investigation.
GID00008750	Whatever.
GID00008751	Whatever.
GID00008752	Whatever.
GID00008753	Whatever.
GID00008754	Don't think too hard, you'll hurt yourself.
GID00008755	Whatever.
GID00008756	Whatever.
GID00008757	Whatever.
GID00008758	Here's a little tink-tink to weight your pockets.
GID00008759	Here you go, this'll give you some zing.
GID00008760	Right on, right on. You're a pretty hip cat.
GID00008761	Right on, right on. You're a pretty hip kitten.
GID00008762	Leaving? Into exile? Good. Save us the trouble.
GID00008763	But mark me well. Any hint of treachery or thought of return and we will erase the both of you from existence.
GID00008764	Respect, nothing. She plans to whisper in his ear. Poison him against the Codex.
GID00008765	A paladin always has a say where the Codex is concerned. Veronica's aspirations are seditious.
GID00008766	All of us here are sworn to obey and protect the Codex, even against one of our own. She's gone too far this time.
GID00008767	No... this has to end now.
GID00008768	Execute them.
GID00008769	Hmmph. She'd be doing a greater service by carrying out her duties and not trying to undermine the elder's authority.
GID00008770	This had better be the last time her loyalty falters. You've been warned.
GID00008771	You're pathetic. Hide behind words all you like, but your cowardice shows through.
GID00008772	Their sentimentality prevents them from administering justice.
GID00008773	Our duty is to the Codex above all, something your companion has forgotten. And that gives us the authority to make it our place.
GID00008774	No. No!
GID00008775	High Elder Maxson didn't just found the Brotherhood. He defined it. To serve in the Brotherhood is to serve his ideals.
GID00008776	Our way of life is based on them. We know no other path. There is no other path.
GID00008777	With her... leanings... Veronica spits in the face of every Knight, Paladin, and Scribe to serve in our ranks.
GID00008778	[SUCCEEDED] Fair enough. It's not like any of the troopers around here are jumping up to volunteer.
GID00008779	[FAILED] That's one of the least trustworthy lines I've ever heard. Sorry. No can do.
GID00008780	If you want to do some good, head up to Camp Forlorn Hope. I'll mark it on your map for you.
GID00008781	That's a shame. Well, let me know if you change your mind or those Legion sons of bitches will be holed up in Nelson for weeks.
GID00008782	Troopers tried moving down from Forlorn Hope because we got this big gap between there and Searchlight. Turns out we were spread too thin.
GID00008783	We took our sweet ass time setting up in Nelson and the Legion managed to hop over the Colorado and attack before things were settled.
GID00008784	There's Novac, due west. Just look for the big lizard. They got some decent supplies and a place to stay.
GID00008785	The 188's north on the 95, good for all kinds of trade. Not much south on 95 unless you turn west on 164 to Nipton, right off the rail line.
GID00008786	Nope. I'm just the only ranger around. The rest of the kids here are troopers, inexperienced, out-numbered and under-equipped.
GID00008787	I sent you packing last time for a reason. Why should I let you in now?
GID00008788	Good. We clear out the hostages and they lose their advantage. They're down in a clearing, crucified on some telephone poles.
GID00008789	I'll cover you from the ridge. Just make it quick. These boys should be put out of their misery, not plinked to death with some old varmint rifle.
GID00008790	And don't get any dreamy notions about playing the hero and dragging those boys out. You'll get swarmed. Now let's go.
GID00008791	[SUCCEEDED] Good point. Anyway, it's your hide. Guess I should take all the help I can get.
GID00008792	[FAILED] Nice speech. Take a hike.
GID00008793	Then I bid you "Vale" - until we meet again.
GID00008800	The great one can be found upstairs. Don't think about wasting his time. He's very important. You should feel lucky to be granted some of his time.
GID00008801	Hurry back. Never have we been so close.
GID00008802	Very few. Time is wasting. Hurry back so we can begin.
GID00008803	It doesn't need to all come from the same source. There are a bunch of different vendors around who sell meat. Fitz, the Nash's, Crimson Caravan...
GID00008804	We've never really tried to go out and organize deals with merchants to supply our food. Already having an overstock of food, we haven't needed to.
GID00008805	But we really need some good-old red meat on the menu soon, so I'm willing to divert some caps in their direction if they're open to supplying us.
GID00008806	What can I do for you?
GID00008807	Have a good one.
GID00008808	Sir, yes, Sir!
GID00008809	Sir, yes, Sir!
GID00008810	My pleasure. Thanks again.
GID00008811	Ahh, doing this out of the goodness of your heart. You don't see that very often around here. Thank you.
GID00008812	You're welcome. Enjoy.
GID00008813	That's very gracious of you. Again, you have my thanks.
GID00008814	Sure.
GID00008815	Okay.
GID00008816	I suppose.
GID00008817	I'm a ranger. They're troopers. Different branches. I don't have authority over them even though they're as green as a Super Mutant's backside.
GID00008818	Besides, they'd probably start crying as soon as they saw the hostages get so much as a bruise. Nope, they don't got the stomach for it.
GID00008819	The troopers won't go down into the camp with their comrades at risk. Dirty game the Legion likes to roll out whenever they get a chance.
GID00008820	Problem is, Ranger Milo doesn't want to play. If we take out the hostages, they've got squat for leverage.
GID00008821	All right, I have to admit I wasn't expecting you to say that. I was just joking. But if it makes you feel any better, I am impressed.
GID00008822	So anyway, how about those hostages?
GID00008823	Good. We clear out the hostages and they lose their advantage. They're down in a clearing, crucified on some telephone poles.
GID00008824	I'll cover you from the ridge. Just make it quick. These boys should be put out of their misery, not plinked to death with some old varmint rifle.
GID00008825	And don't get any dreamy notions about playing the hero and dragging those boys out. You'll get swarmed. Now let's go.
GID00008826	Back at "Ranger School", they taught us not to run headlong into a battle when you're outnumbered ten to one.
GID00008827	You want to go down there and try to haul those crippled boys off those poles, you're dumber than you look.
GID00008828	"Dishonorable", that's a good one. Okay then, you can just turn around and head back toward Novac or wherever it is you came from.
GID00008829	I wouldn't want you to get any dirt under your fingernails or tarnish your good name or whatever the heck you're so worried about.
GID00008830	If you want to do some good, head up to Camp Forlorn Hope. I'll mark it on your map for you.
GID00008831	[SUCCEEDED] Well, I'll be damned. Looks like you've got some dirt in you after all.
GID00008832	[FAILED] Right. You have trouble even saying the word "bad". Go on, get out of here if you know what's good for you.
GID00008833	If you want to do some good, head up to Camp Forlorn Hope. I'll mark it on your map for you.
GID00008834	[SUCCEEDED] Well, I suppose I don't care much, either. At least not enough to turn down an offer for help.
GID00008835	Well, now that you've sweet-talked me...
GID00008836	[FAILED] Naw, why don't you just get out of here?
GID00008891	[SUCCEEDED] Being sentimental is not how I made the Crimson Caravan so successful, but I'll allow it, just this once.
GID00008892	Janet will be paid what she's owed. Consider it a gift.
GID00008893	[FAILED] You'll have to try harder than that. The rumors about my heart being made of stone are true.
GID00008894	[SUCCEEDED] Intriguing. Janet puts in a good word for me, and the Crimson Caravan gains exclusive access to the Boomers. Yes, that works for me.
GID00008895	Janet will be paid what she's owed. Consider it a gift.
GID00008896	[FAILED] The Crimson Caravan Company's operations require dependable employees. I'm not going to reward someone for breaking their work contract.
GID00008897	Take all the time you need.
GID00008898	I'm glad to hear it.
GID00008899	Most merchant companies - successful merchant companies, rather - have them. It can be inconvenient to replace employees on short notice.
GID00008900	The contracts keep employees around for a specific duration of time, after which they get paid - after their upkeep expenses are deducted, of course.
GID00008901	Food, water, living quarters, medicine, and clothes - just the basic stuff. It all comes out of the Company's coffers.
GID00008902	Yes, and they have been for decades now. The hired hands know what they're signing up for - we don't hide anything with fancy talk.
GID00008903	That's because we are. We always pay up when the contract ends, though. Won't stay in business long if you've got a reputation as a cheat.
GID00008904	See ya.
GID00008905	Need anything else?
GID00008906	Well, pain-killers are easy to come by, but it isn't easy finding iodine, allergy meds, and a few of these other items. Why do you ask?
GID00008907	Really? Huh, never thought of that. The Crimson Caravan isn't really in the drug business.
GID00008908	Really? Huh, never thought of that. The Crimson Caravan isn't really in the drug business.
GID00008909	Excellent. We should be able to get the shipments started in about a week.
GID00008910	[SUCCEEDED] Well, the Far Go Traders have been trying to edge us out on the new armor contract for the troops. This could swing things in our favor.
GID00008911	All right, let McCarran know they should expect the first shipment in a week or so.
GID00008912	[FAILED] This is business. I really can't cut them a deal on the cost.
GID00008913	[SUCCEEDED] That should work. We'll do a weighted exchanged based on the going value of meat and vegetables. Water is invaluable in this dusty hole.
GID00008914	Let McCarran know they should expect the first shipment in a week or so.
GID00008915	[FAILED] We don't need vegetables, and besides, they spoil. The meat you can dry and turn into jerky.
GID00008916	Trade routes, my friend, trade routes. Just about every major town in the wasteland has a Crimson Caravan branch in it.
GID00008917	Out here, we usually split our caravans into smaller bands - that way, we don't lose everything if they get hit.
GID00008918	It's not very efficient, though, but hopefully we'll be able to start running larger caravans once things get civilized.
GID00008919	A little place in the NCR called Oak Creek. Used to be a farming town until it got taken over by ranchers.
GID00008920	I didn't want to herd Brahmin for a living, so I signed on with the Crimson Caravan and headed east. Not much to tell, really.
GID00008921	Oh, heck, I've heard of you. Supposed to be a regular hero or something, ain't that right?
GID00008922	But maybe you're a little too... "reputable" to get involved in some dirty work for the Republic.
GID00008923	I've heard of you. You're just the kind of person I'm looking for. Not afraid of stepping on a few toes to get a job done. Think you can lend a hand?
GID00008924	Is that so? Can't say I've ever heard a good word about you. Lot of bad ones, though.
GID00008925	So why don't you just turn your butt around and scoot back down the road before I blast some daylight through you?
GID00008926	My apologies, but that name and face ain't ringing the old school bell upstairs. Afraid I can't let you through until the "situation" is resolved.
GID00008927	Much obliged.
GID00008928	Son of a bitch!
GID00008929	We'll see about that.
GID00008930	If you had a few dozen doses of Psycho on you, maybe we could pep these weepy troopers into charging down into Nelson and taking back the camp.
GID00008931	But since that's not likely, you could help me take out the Legion's trooper hostages.
GID00008932	You got it.
GID00008933	Excellent, just let me grab my scalpel, and a body bag and we'll get started.
GID00008934	Well, you'll probably be fine. For a little while, anyway.
GID00008935	Excellent, just let me grab my scalpel, and a body bag and we'll get started.
GID00008936	Well, you'll probably be fine. For a little while, anyway.
GID00009049	For around five years now. I handle the supply ends of things - raw materials and stuff.
GID00009050	Makers of the finest high-grade weapons and ammunition in the wasteland.
GID00009051	If you ever get your hands on a piece of sweet, deadly hardware, there's a good chance that it came from one of our factories.
GID00009052	[SUCCEEDED] I guess we'll have to. If Caesar's Legion drives the NCR from the area, there goes ninety percent of our business.
GID00009053	I don't like the idea of buying supplies from our competition, but it's only temporary. We'll call in extra supplies from our distributors.
GID00009054	Let Contreras know we'll have the extra guns and ammo ready for the next shipment.
GID00009055	[FAILED] Oh hell, no. Working with our competition is not an option.
GID00009056	[SUCCEEDED] You're right. I suppose we could refurbish used and damaged weapons to fill the order.
GID00009057	They'll be in like new condition and then we can use our loader to make fresh ammo from spent brass.
GID00009058	We'll have to wait a few days for gunpowder, but this might just work out. Tell Contreras the extra guns and ammo will be in the next shipment.
GID00009059	[FAILED] Sorry, but blackening our reputation with our biggest client isn't worth the risk.
GID00009060	No problem.
GID00009061	Well, I guess so. Look. We just need metal, and lots of it.
GID00009062	We can handle the weapons, we just need extra scrap to melt down for the bullets.
GID00009063	I'll give you some caps for each piece of metal you can bring me. Anything like scrap, cans, or any basic junk made of metal will do.
GID00009064	I'll need at least 100 pieces to have enough for the bullets. I'll cash in whatever you've got until we have enough. Good luck.
GID00009065	None whatsoever. Everything inside the fence is off-limits, and the guards have strict orders to shoot to kill.
GID00009066	A lot of our high-end weaponry comes from Pre-War military schematics. If our competition got a hold of them, it'd be bad for business.
GID00009067	Thanks, that'll help.
GID00009068	Thanks, that'll help.
GID00009069	Thanks, that'll help.
GID00009070	Thanks, that'll help.
GID00009071	Thanks, that'll help.
GID00009072	Thanks, that'll help.
GID00009073	Thanks, that'll help.
GID00009074	Thanks, that'll help.
GID00009075	Thanks, that'll help.
GID00009076	Well, keep at it.
GID00009077	Out here, we don't have bosses. Me, the gunsmiths, and the guards all know what we're supposed to be doing.
GID00009078	Working for the Gun Runners is a sweet job. None of us would dare screw it up.
GID00009079	Yep. I always warned him not to push my buttons. Well, ain't nobody going to miss him, anyways.
GID00009080	Here you go. I promised you an extra reward for coming along, so that's what you get.
GID00009081	Maybe, maybe not. I always warned him not to push my buttons. Well, ain't nobody going to miss him, anyways.
GID00009082	Here you go. I promised you an extra reward for coming along, so that's what you get.
GID00009083	Here you go. I promised you an extra reward for coming along, so that's what you get.
GID00009084	It's been a pleasure.
GID00009085	I'm afraid we have no current openings for caravaneers or guards, but I'm in need of a runner.
GID00009086	Deliver this invoice to Dr. Hildern. You can find him somewhere inside Camp McCarran.
GID00009087	I see. Was there anything else, then?
GID00009088	As much as I like to handle matters personally, I can't be everywhere at once.
GID00009089	There is a negotiation with a smaller trading outfit that I'd like resolved as quickly as possible.
GID00009090	There's also the matter of Henry Jamison, an employee whose services I'd rather do without. His family connections make it difficult, however.
GID00009091	And finally, I need someone to "acquire" the Gun Runner's manufacturing specifications. This job needs to be quiet - no alarms, no deaths.
GID00009092	Certainly. What would you like to know?
GID00009093	The Crimson Caravan Company has been in business for over 130 years. We're partially responsible for the progress in the NCR.
GID00009094	Well, the Gun Runners continue to dominate the weapons market, and the Mormon traders from New Canaan control the majority of the northern routes.
GID00009095	Normally, I oversee company operations at the Hub in California. However, the New Vegas branch has been underperforming in recent years.
GID00009096	Given the conditions here, it's not hard to see why. I'll change all that, soon enough.
GID00009097	All right. Is there anything else I can do for you?
GID00009098	There's a small trading outfit, Cassidy Caravans, that I'm interested in acquiring. They've been rather competitive, so it's time to buy them out.
GID00009099	I have it on good authority that the owner, Cass, wants out of the caravan business.
GID00009100	Cass frequently trades with the NCR, so you'll likely find her at the Mojave Outpost.
GID00009101	The Jamisons are very wealthy ranchers back in Redding, California and significant investors in the Crimson Caravan Company.
GID00009102	I was pressured into posting young Henry as the manager of the New Vegas branch. As you can see, he wasn't exactly cut out for the job.
GID00009103	He was much more interested in gambling and prostitutes, and because of his family, I can't simply fire him.
GID00009104	Henry needs to be convinced to quit, one way or another. I won't have a useless employee on the company payroll.
GID00009105	The quality of the Gun Runners' armaments is due to their manufacturing process. They craft all weapons on-site.
GID00009106	I want to know the secrets of their manufacturing process, which means you'll need to find some way to get inside their heavily-guarded factory.
GID00009107	I would greatly prefer that you perform this job undetected and without killing anyone, if it can be helped.
GID00009108	Thank you. Was there something else?
GID00009109	Fuck no. No matter what that old bitch McLafferty says, my dad said I could be in charge of the New Vegas branch.
GID00009110	Besides, I got into a little money trouble with the Omertas. If I quit the Crimson Caravan, how am I supposed to get the money to gamble?
GID00009111	Yeah, whatever.
GID00009112	One of the families that runs the Strip. They're a pack of cheaters, but you still don't want to fuck with them.
GID00009113	[SUCCEEDED] Fine, whatever. Forget the severance. Just get the Omertas off my back, and you can tell McLafferty she won't see my face again.
GID00009114	[FAILED] Tough shit. That's what I want, or I'm not going anywhere.
GID00009115	We done, then?
GID00009116	You do that. And tell the old bitch to pay up quick, you hear?
GID00009117	I wanted to be where the action is, so I got my dad to pull some strings and get me a cushy position with the Crimson Caravan.
GID00009118	Everything was great until McLafferty came along. That old bitch is gonna hear about it from my dad, just you wait.
GID00009119	That's all right.
GID00009120	Have a seat in the Auto-Doc. This will take a few hours.
GID00009121	Have a seat in the Auto-Doc. This will take a few hours.
GID00009122	Have a seat in the Auto-Doc. This will take a few hours.
GID00009123	Huh. I've never seen a coin toss go someone's way that many times. You certainly don't need the help of a Probability Calculator implant.
GID00009124	If fact, you ought to be on the Strip cleaning out the casinos.
GID00009125	If I implant the Probability Calculator in your frontal lobe, you'll be able to calculate odds a little better.
GID00009126	It's not quite the same as making you luckier, but you'll be able to nudge things your way more often. I can do the implant for 4000 caps.
GID00009127	Have a seat in the Auto-Doc. This will take a few hours.
GID00009128	Have a seat in the Auto-Doc. This will take a few hours.
GID00009129	Have a seat in the Auto-Doc. This will take a few hours.
GID00009130	Have a seat in the Auto-Doc. This will take a few hours.
GID00009131	All right. Sit still and let me work.
GID00009132	I'm afraid I can't do this for free. My supplies are stretched thin enough as it is.
GID00009133	All right. Sit still and let me work.
GID00009134	All right. Sit still and let me work.
GID00009135	I'm afraid I can't do this for free. My supplies are stretched thin enough as it is.
GID00009136	I'm afraid I can't do this for free. My supplies are stretched thin enough as it is.
GID00009137	All right, this will only take a few minutes.
GID00009138	I'm afraid I can't do this for free. My supplies are stretched thin enough as it is.
GID00009139	All right.
GID00009140	Yes, I am. I received my medical training at the Angel's Boneyard Medical University back in the NCR.
GID00009141	It's not a requirement to be a Follower to enter the university, but I believe in what they do, so I joined them.
GID00009142	Of course! We prefer bulk donations of 500 caps - it's apparently a lot easier on the accountants, for some reason.
GID00009143	We believe that technology for basic necessities, like food, water, and medicine, should be shared, not hoarded.
GID00009144	We're also strongly in favor of proper education. I've come across more than a few "doctors" whose techniques came out of the back of a magazine.
GID00009145	We've worked with them in the past. The NCR became too focused on things like patents and profitability, so the Followers go their own way now.
GID00009146	The NCR and the Followers have a cool relationship at the moment. We see them as oppressive, and they view us as anarchists.
GID00009147	Yes, the Mormon Fort in Freeside. It's hard to miss.
GID00009148	Very much appreciated. These caps will go towards funding schools and other services to the poorer part of the community.
GID00009149	No need to apologize.
GID00009150	Of course.
GID00009151	Have a seat in the Auto-Doc. This will take a few hours.
GID00009152	That's all right.
GID00009153	Have a seat in the Auto-Doc. This will take a few hours.
GID00009154	That's all right.
GID00009155	Not interested? Not interested?
GID00009156	You have an interest in this even if you're too stupid to know it. If you have an interest in breathing, you have an interest in this.
GID00009157	Return to the Fort and do whatever it takes to recover the Chip.
GID00009158	It was a place of splendor. As magnificent as today's Strip may seem, it's but a shadow of the neon paradise that was Las Vegas.
GID00009159	I grew up not far from here, and though I traveled the old world extensively, I never found another place like it.
GID00009160	By 2065 I deemed it a mathematical certainty that an atomic war would devastate the Earth within 15 years. Every projection I ran confirmed it.
GID00009161	I knew I couldn't "save the world," nor did I care to. But I could save Vegas, and in the process, perhaps, save mankind.
GID00009162	I set to work immediately. I thought I had plenty of time to prepare. As it turned out, I was 20 hours short.
GID00009163	On the day of the Great War, 77 atomic warheads targeted Las Vegas and its surrounding areas.
GID00009164	My networked mainframes were able to predict and force-transmit disarm code subsets to 59 warheads, neutralizing them before impact.
GID00009165	Laser cannons mounted on the roof of the Lucky 38 destroyed another 9 warheads. The rest got through, though none hit the city itself.
GID00009166	A sub-optimal performance, admittedly. If only the Platinum Chip had arrived a day sooner...
GID00009167	The Platinum Chip was printed in Sunnyvale, California on October 22nd, 2077 - the day before the Great War.
GID00009168	It was to have been delivered by courier the following afternoon... but by then, the world had ended.
GID00009169	The Chip contained vital software upgrades, but not just for my Securitrons. Every aspect of the missile defense grid would have been upgraded, too.
GID00009170	Given that I had to make do with buggy software, the outcome could have been worse. I nearly died as it was.
GID00009171	Software glitches set off a cascade of system crashes. I had to take the Lucky 38's reactor offline, lest it melt down.
GID00009172	For nearly five years I battled power outages and more system crashes until I finally managed to reboot my data core with an older version of the OS.
GID00009173	I spent the next few decades in a veritable coma. But I survived, obviously - and eventually thrived.
GID00009174	Later.
GID00009175	I don't know. Some kind of man-fish freak like the one I killed over there.
GID00009176	I'd heard fishermen spin old tales of 'Lakelurks' swimming in the water, but I always thought they were just bullshit mermaid stories.
GID00009177	Fool! We've fortified this place to hold out indefinitely against an army. What chance do you think you have?
GID00009178	The army of bloodthirsty maniacs with you would disagree. No, I think I'll hold the fort here until our reinforcements arrive.
GID00009179	If that's true, then there's nothing else for it. My men and I will hold out as long as we can.
GID00009180	Do you really think your ragtag band of slavers has more manpower than the armed forces of the NCR?
GID00009181	I'd pit one of my men against two of your cutthroats any day. Backed by additional troops, we'll mop the floor with your pathetic Legion.
GID00009182	And go where? According to you, the road west is blocked. And while you might let us by, I highly doubt your allies will do the same.
GID00009183	My thoughts exactly.
GID00009184	Better that than simply give up. What other option is available? Retreat?
GID00009185	Then let's get this over with.
GID00009186	[SUCCEEDED] Perhaps I do have a secret tunnel out of here. But that doesn't change anything. My duty is to stay and fight.
GID00009187	[FAILED] Even if we hadn't blocked the river to prevent the Legion from coming at us from the south, that'd be absurd.
GID00009188	Caesar's forces are arrayed all along the eastern bank. We'd be under fire the whole way.
GID00009189	My men and I are soldiers. We share an obligation to follow orders. And our orders are to hold this dam.
GID00009190	It will see that our orders are carried through to the end. That's what good soldiers do.
GID00009191	[SUCCEEDED] Y-You're right. These men have placed their lives in my hands, and I won't throw them away for a lost cause.
GID00009192	Don't expect to hold this place for very long, however. The NCR will be back.
GID00009193	[FAILED] It sure as hell is. Aside from being an important source of power and water, it's a symbol of hope.
GID00009194	Though I wouldn't expect someone like you to understand that.
GID00009195	We choose to stay, though I think we'll all debate you on the dying part.
GID00009196	I suppose there's no point in remaining here any longer. Very well, my men and I will leave.
GID00009197	Don't expect to hold this place for very long, however. The NCR will be back.
GID00009198	Wow, I wish I had more of them. All this interest. It'd be my biggest seller.
GID00009199	I sold it to a man not too long ago. Real twitchy, nervous sort of guy. Kinda seemed like he was wiggin' out about something.
GID00009200	Had a funny collar on. I wanted to ask him about it but I figured maybe I'd regret asking. People are weird around here.
GID00009201	Well it was metal, and kind of thick. At first I thought he'd come from Gomorrah, but they're more into leather there.
GID00009202	Didn't look comfortable. He kept reaching up like he was gonna itch it, but he always stopped himself.
GID00009203	No, but I know where he was going. He asked me if I knew of any place where he could hide out for a while.
GID00009204	Wanted somewhere with concrete walls. Something about airwaves. I forget.
GID00009205	But I guess he spent all his money on the rangefinder, because he said it had to be somewhere free to stay.
GID00009206	I said I didn't know about anything like that around here. But if he wanted to live for free, a lot of people do that in Freeside.
GID00009207	I know there's a concrete building there across from Mick and Ralph's. No ceiling, but I think it still counts.
GID00009208	Went up there one time to try and... you know... meet my neighbors in the biz. But you know, I don't think they took me very seriously.
GID00009209	Oh he was pretty average, I'd say. Average height, average age. Dark hair. Beard of some kind.
GID00009210	Thank Mars. The assault can resume.
GID00009211	The only thing down there is a swim of several hundred feet against the current. You'd drown for sure.
GID00009212	This slaughter pleases me. No act is more sacred than consecrating a site in the blood of one's enemies.
GID00009213	The rest of the dam is fully under our control. A few pitiful holdouts remain, but their time is short. The general was the last source of concern.
GID00009214	With their commander dead, the NCR will pull out of this region, allowing our conquest to continue westward unopposed for a time.
GID00009215	Judging by the lack of blood, I take it the coward Oliver fled rather than face me. No matter.
GID00009216	The rest of the dam is fully under our control. A few pitiful holdouts remain, but their time is short. The general was the last source of concern.
GID00009217	With their commander gone, the NCR will pull out of this region, allowing our conquest to continue westward unopposed for a time.
GID00009218	The Legion will swell with the number of slaves we will claim from this place, and the tribute we gather will fund further campaigns.
GID00009219	Perhaps, in time, I will be granted the honor of conquering the land known as California. But for now, we rest.
GID00009220	Know that your efforts are appreciated and will not go unrewarded. But we can speak of that later.
GID00009221	For now, come, we must see to the burning of the dead.
GID00009222	Blah.
GID00009223	Finally, Mars has accepted my sacrifices and unleashes me.
GID00009224	Legatus, a stranger arrives. One who bears the Mark.
GID00009225	And yet you managed to slip past. Impressive. You may not find the fighting to the west quite so easy to get around, however.
GID00009226	Good news, indeed. If only the same could be said for the west.
GID00009227	The enemy is much more fortified ahead, and have snipers set up at key positions, which keep our men pinned down.
GID00009228	In addition, they've managed to beat back our men emerging from the intake tower ahead and secure it.
GID00009229	If we could just get rid of those damn snipers, or release our waiting men in the intake tower, we'd have the manpower to storm their positions.
GID00009230	My contubernium came up through one of the intake towers ahead and headed east, taking the NCR fools unawares from behind.
GID00009231	Their confusion allowed us to slaughter them like brahmin calves. Unfortunately, my brothers heading west did not fare as well.
GID00009232	Any assistance you can provide is welcome, and will mean more of our men to carve through the foe by your side.
GID00009233	Then I wish you luck, and good hunting.
GID00009234	Ha ha, Mars favors the bold, does he not?
GID00009235	This is definitely part of my missing supplies. I'll talk to Major Polatli about this right away.
GID00009236	[SUCCEEDED] I... I guess you're right. I'll do the right thing and turn myself in.
GID00009237	Stay safe.
GID00009238	Sure.
GID00009239	Sure.
GID00009240	Sure.
GID00009241	Understandable. Let me know when you've decided.
GID00009242	Okay.
GID00009243	Okay.
GID00009244	Sure.
GID00009245	Alright.
GID00009246	Look, I'm not leaving this place 'til I have what I came for. I'll be in the storage basement if you change your mind.
GID00009247	Damn right it is. Now let's get going.
GID00009248	Then get your ass back into town before talking to me. I wanna know you're serious about this.
GID00009249	Okay, but please find him as soon as you can.
GID00009250	What? How? What happened?
GID00009251	What? Why the hell would you do that? Are you insane?
GID00009252	Dammit! Okay, well, thank you for finding out at least. Was there something else you needed?
GID00009253	Oh, because that makes it so much better! Get out of my sight, I have nothing to say to you any more!
GID00009254	You're psychotic! Get out of my sight, I have nothing to say to you any more!
GID00009255	Huh? Wait, what are you talking about? We're allied with Caesar now? Psh. Typical. Nobody tells me anything.
GID00009256	Oh, nothing really. Just trying to psych myself up to try my initiation. Again. Raaaar!
GID00009257	I can tell you they're a bunch of big dumb jerks with no appreciation for art. I mean, can you believe their initiation?
GID00009258	You would? Really? Okay, well then, here goes:
GID00009259	This one's a haiku.
GID00009260	Radscorpion bites,
GID00009261	my foot in the box canyon.
GID00009262	Ow, ow, ow, ow... ow.
GID00009263	I wrote this limerick the last time I went to Freeside.
GID00009264	There once was a fellow called Garret,
GID00009265	whose sister she did love to bare it.
GID00009266	She flashed it around, all over town,
GID00009267	so if you would screw her, beware it.
GID00009268	I, uh, got kicked out of the Atomic Wrangler for that one.
GID00009269	This is a poem I wrote about the dark loneliness that suffuses my soul.
GID00009270	Rainclouds wrap my heart in sorrow black as silk,
GID00009271	My empty scream does not echo, even though we're in a canyon.
GID00009272	My soul aches, but not as much as my limbs, because I've been beaten severely.
GID00009273	Here's one about the girl I love.
GID00009274	Her hair stands tall, like the spiky bits on a Deathclaw.
GID00009275	Her eyes are bright as radioactive sludge, glowing with the light of love.
GID00009276	But when I talk to her, she laughs and mocks and has her brothers beat me.
GID00009277	Oh, why do nice girls hate me?
GID00009278	That's it. What do you think?
GID00009279	Oh. You heard that, huh? Okay, so yeah, I was writing poetry. I know, I know, it's not a very Great Khan-like thing to do.
GID00009280	The Followers of the Apocalypse came to our camp when I was a kid, and they brought a bunch of old books. I used to read pre-War poetry for hours.
GID00009281	Yeah, well, I guess maybe I'm not. But what else can I do?
GID00009282	Sure, okay.
GID00009283	Have you seen this tribe? If it's not an epic drunken ballad of cracking skulls and hearing lamentations they think it's a waste of time.
GID00009284	You'd do that? Thanks! I mean, I'd go myself, but what if they said no? The Khans wouldn't take me back, and then I'd have nobody.
GID00009285	I don't know. I mean, I'd go myself, but what if they said no? The Khans wouldn't take me back, and then I'd have nobody.
GID00009286	You think so? I mean, I'd go myself, but what if they said no? The Khans wouldn't take me back, and then I'd have nobody.
GID00009287	No, I suppose not.
GID00009288	Not much. They found us when we came to the Mojave, gave us a bunch of books on science and history - I guess they're like teachers or something?
GID00009289	We're always looking for new members. Does he have any particular talent?
GID00009290	Hmm. Well, I suppose we could always use another junior archivist in the library. All right, tell him we'll accept him as a probationary initiate.
GID00009291	Excellent! Ezekiel's been after me to find him a new assistant for ages. Tell the boy we'll take him.
GID00009292	Ah. Well... I suppose we could always find him a place. Maybe doing inventory on the Pre-War Unexploded Munitions Collection back West.
GID00009293	All right, tell the boy to report here, he can leave on the next caravan.
GID00009294	They did? That's great! Thank you! I'm out of this crummy camp!
GID00009295	I've got a message for you from Papa Khan. He wants you to return to Red Rock Canyon and speak to him as soon as possible.
GID00009296	You're already quite charming. The Empathy Synthesizer would just be a waste of caps, I'm afraid.
GID00009297	The Empathy Synthesizer will allow you to more easily pick up on subtle emotions and body language. The price is 4,000 caps.
GID00009298	That would be the NEMEAN Sub-Dermal Armor. It's a bit pricey - 8,000 caps - but the implant causes your skin cells to be bolstered with iron.
GID00009299	It won't make you bulletproof, but it will make you a little harder to injure.
GID00009300	That's the PHOENIX Monocyte Breeder. The implant speeds up cell regeneration, an effect similar to that of some lizards and sea creatures.
GID00009301	The implant is very expensive, however - 12,000 caps.
GID00009302	Have a seat in the Auto-Doc. This will take a few hours.
GID00009303	Very well.
GID00009304	The Platinum Chip unlocks this bunker. Hence, you have it.
GID00009305	Hence, Benny was captured or killed - possibly by you, but by my estimates, far more probably by Caesar's Legion. Hence, Caesar gave you the Chip.
GID00009306	Hence, Caesar wants you to destroy whatever you find in this bunker.
GID00009307	That you were searched very thoroughly when you arrived at the Fort is a certainty. And as the Chip is a little too large to be secreted away...
GID00009308	I also regard it a certainty that the Chip was discovered, taken from you, and given to Caesar - who returned it to you.
GID00009309	Two plus two equaling four, Caesar wants you to destroy whatever you find in this bunker.
GID00009310	But that's not going to happen, because you're going to work for me.
GID00009311	That's rather obvious, isn't it?
GID00009312	Surely you know that I am Robert Edwin House, President, CEO, and sole proprietor of the New Vegas Strip.
GID00009313	I oversaw the city's renovations starting from 2274 onward. The Three Families are my employees.
GID00009314	It's a facility I built many years before you were born. You might think of it as a kind of barracks. You'll understand soon enough.
GID00009315	It's a facility I built many years before you were born. You might think of it as a barracks. You'll understand soon enough.
GID00009316	Was that meant to be a shocking revelation? Of course Caesar wants it destroyed - he's afraid of what the bunker might hold, and rightly so.
GID00009317	But you're not going to do that. You're going to do the smart thing, and work for me.
GID00009318	I don't respond well to threats. Now, where were we...?
GID00009319	[SUCCEEDED] Fine, you'll receive a nice bonus when the work is done. And speaking of getting it done...
GID00009320	[FAILED] You signed a contract to deliver the Platinum Chip, and you'll be paid when the delivery is made.
GID00009321	Good. I won't hold you up any longer.
GID00009322	I like to think you have enough sense to do the right thing. The rewards for doing so are immense... as are the punishments for not doing so.
GID00009323	So what are you doing here? Return to the Fort at once.
GID00009324	Recover the Platinum Chip. Once you've entered the bunker hidden beneath the weather station, you'll receive further instructions.
GID00009325	Are you a child? The Platinum Chip was taken from you, obviously.
GID00009326	That would make for a welcome change.
GID00009327	Then gather together the firepower or explosives or whatever else you need and improvise.
GID00009328	I don't care if you have to kill every Legionary at the Fort. Get the job done.
GID00009329	Goodbye? Is that some kind of joke? You barely understand what I want you to accomplish down there.
GID00009330	I've spent too many years waiting for this moment to see it fumbled by an insubordinate contractor.
GID00009331	I can't reach through this monitor and compell you to follow instructions, but know this - if you disappoint me, you will pay for it.
GID00009332	It is obvious to you that I built this place? The Platinum Chip opened it, after all?
GID00009333	In any case, you're here. So let's get to it.
GID00009334	My army will do what an army does best - defend territory from invaders... and maintain order.
GID00009335	The same equipment failure that prevents me from remotely operating this facility seems to have activated its security robots and turrets.
GID00009336	There's a security room near the base of the stairs... perhaps you can deactivate them yourself.
GID00009337	Listen to me, very carefully. I've waited too long for this moment for you to go fouling it up on a lark.
GID00009338	Do as I say, and your rewards will be immense. Thwart me, and your punishment will become the purpose of my existence.
GID00009339	Then there will be no safe haven for you.
GID00009340	I see - you're in a predicament.
GID00009341	Just off the turbine room down below are three power regulators. It's a redundant system - only one is needed.
GID00009342	Go ahead and destroy one. The explosion will be large enough to be heard and felt aboveground.
GID00009343	The bunker will be destroyed, and you'll die instantly.
GID00009344	I see that now. I thought I knew him better than that. But it was like talking to a stranger.
GID00009345	No. Our case wouldn't be any stronger if tomorrow they all died when their energy weapons backfired.
GID00009346	I just didn't expect that. There was no getting through to him.
GID00009347	Well I knew he wouldn't listen to me. That's why we went out of our way to find something that he couldn't ignore.
GID00009348	But it didn't make any difference.
GID00009349	How can I help them when they won't accept it?
GID00009350	It wouldn't matter. The Elder has final say.
GID00009351	The hell of it is he's one of our most progressive members. If I can't get him to agree, it's hopeless.
GID00009352	He won't tolerate any resistance. If he catches wind I've been talking to people, he'll charge me with sedition.
GID00009353	I... I don't know if I can stay. Maybe it'd be better for everyone if I left. Spent my life... somewhere else.
GID00009354	Work with the Followers of the Apocalypse, maybe. Put my knowledge to some good use.
GID00009355	Or I can stay here with the people I care about and do... whatever I can, until it comes to a slow or sudden end.
GID00009356	Ha! Well that's... imaginative. But it's not really for me.
GID00009357	I couldn't get one of their most reasonable members to accept a rational argument. I don't see them coming out in droves to support my coup.
GID00009358	And that's really not what the Brotherhood needs right now anyway. They're hanging by a thread.
GID00009359	They may be a bunch of wooden conformists, but anything I did without them would feel... empty.
GID00009360	I'd always be reminded of this day. How I wasn't strong enough to stand by them.
GID00009361	So I guess I'll stay. Won't be easy, but at least I won't feel guilty about the choice.
GID00009362	Let's get going. I'd like to get my mind off all this. And some fresh air would do me some good right about now.
GID00009363	There's no getting around that, is there? What would my life be like here, knowing what's to come?
GID00009364	They're not going to like this. We're given a chance when we're young to choose whether to stay. If we do, it's supposed to be for life.
GID00009365	But they haven't left me any choice. It's this or a lifetime of scavenging and watching my friends die in losing battles. I guess it's settled, then.
GID00009366	Not even a hint, huh? Geez, I really am all alone on this one.
GID00009367	I guess I'll stay. If I left there wouldn't be any coming back. It might be something I'd instantly regret.
GID00009368	Things are going to get harder for the Brotherhood before they get easier. I should support them in whatever way I can.
GID00009369	I suppose you've given me no reason not to trust you. Fine, take the data and go. I hope you know what you're doing.
GID00009370	He didn't say, but it sounded very important.
GID00009371	Excellent. I'll let him know you're coming. Good luck out there.
GID00009372	That's too bad. I hope you'll change your mind.
GID00009373	In exchange for great Caesar's promise of all the lands west of New Vegas, the Khans have agreed to fight alongside the Legion when the time comes.
GID00009374	I am one of the frumentarii: it is my duty to scout the Wastes in Caesar's name and make contact with any tribes that might serve a useful purpose.
GID00009375	You might say I'm somewhere between a scout and an ambassador. I'm assigned here as part of the alliance between the Legion and the Great Khans.
GID00009376	Though they have been cruelly oppressed by the NCR, the Khans remain great warriors. The Legion is honored to have such allies in battle.
GID00009377	Speak, then.
GID00009378	You don't have to say anything - I am Papa Khan, and I have spoken. When I'm gone, you will lead the tribe.
GID00009379	In a hurry, are you? Very well then: The Great Khans came east out of the NCR 14 years ago. We ruled the Wastes, then, and called no man master.
GID00009380	But we underestimated the Families of the Strip, and they drove us back to Bitter Springs, where we remained until the NCR arrived and drove us here.
GID00009381	Typical. No reverence for history in the younger generations.
GID00009382	They allied with Mr. House, the self-proclaimed master of New Vegas. He supported them with the resources of New Vegas: weapons, technology, caps.
GID00009383	They were better equipped, and we could not stand against them.
GID00009384	When the NCR came to the Mojave, we thought they would be easy pickings. We raided their caravans, their towns, their camps - they couldn't stop us.
GID00009385	At least, that's what we thought. They tracked us to Bitter Springs and surrounded us.
GID00009386	When our children, our sick and old, fled through a nearby pass, the NCR gunned them down.
GID00009387	Oh, they claimed it was a miscommunication, but tell that to those who saw our families butchered. Tell it to the survivors who were banished here.
GID00009388	It's because of that that we have sworn to take revenge on the NCR. With our new allies in Caesar's Legion, we will crush them!
GID00009389	Then when I die, you can pass control of the Great Khans on to Regis. For now you are my heir, and will be accorded the honor of that position.
GID00009390	Nothing, forget about it. I shouldn't be talking about this with an outsider.
GID00009391	I probably shouldn't say anything, but it seems Papa's been making decisions based more on his desire for revenge than what's good for the tribe.
GID00009392	This alliance with Caesar, for one thing - I have my doubts about it.
GID00009393	I really don't like to talk about it. Let's just say it was a tragedy and the NCR is to blame, and we'll leave it at that.
GID00009394	Sure, go ahead.
GID00009395	I just don't trust the words of Caesar's ambassador that much. He's promising a lot, and I don't see the advantage for him. It makes me suspicious.
GID00009396	As you wish. When Caesar goes to war, we go with him.
GID00009397	As you wish. When the Republic goes to war, we go with it.
GID00009398	I... very well. If that's what you want, that's what we'll do.
GID00009399	I'll start the preparations and we'll leave when the NCR is distracted by Caesar's attack.
GID00009400	As you wish, chieftain.
GID00009401	What does the Codex say?
GID00009402	The Codex is clear on this. It's-
GID00009403	A bunch of closed-minded bullshit.
GID00009404	We do not help them, or let them in.
GID00009405	It says they can't be trusted.
GID00009406	But-
GID00009407	We keep knowledge they must never have.
GID00009408	It says that we are to protect humanity from them at all costs.
GID00009409	Give it a chance. For me. I can't stay here and watch us waste away.
GID00009410	I'm sorry.
GID00009411	I can't.
GID00009412	We'll die out.
GID00009413	<Sighs> I know.
GID00009414	Then we will accept that fate with honor.
GID00009415	Come on. I can't listen to this anymore.
GID00009416	We unlocked the secret of HELIOS One.
GID00009417	What? Wonderful news!
GID00009418	Then we have a game-changing weapon.
GID00009419	No. It's not. ARCHIMEDES II is an orbital laser. Effective only outdoors in a limited radius and requiring a long recharge.
GID00009420	In the hands of the enemy-
GID00009421	It was worth keeping from our enemies. If they had it-
GID00009422	They'd be marginally more effective. We lost most of the chapter defending glorified artillery.
GID00009423	We couldn't have known. We fought for what we believed in.
GID00009424	We did as the Codex dictated.
GID00009425	And nearly died for it. Tomorrow you'd do it all over again, having learned nothing.
GID00009426	Are you trying to shame me?
GID00009427	How dare you insult the honor of the brothers and sisters who died there!
GID00009428	I'm trying to open your eyes.
GID00009429	We need to engage the outside world. We can't win without new recruits.
GID00009430	Veronica. I hope-
GID00009431	Shouldn't you be securing supplies for us?
GID00009432	I brought you a present.
GID00009433	This disk has secrets to breeding plants that can thrive in the wasteland.
GID00009434	High Elder Maxson didn't found us to be botanists, Veronica.
GID00009435	I'm waiting to hear why this deserves our attention.
GID00009436	Think about it. No more trading guns for food. Total self-sufficiency. It's what we always wanted.
GID00009437	This won't get us Hoover Dam.
GID00009438	This won't defeat our enemies.
GID00009439	Yes it will. If we feed people, they'll support us. They'll join us.
GID00009440	We found a gun that disables power armor. One of these could defeat the whole Brotherhood.
GID00009441	We have to stop limiting our focus to military technology. It won't save us.
GID00009442	That could be the only one of its kind.
GID00009443	Then it's a good thing this weapon has fallen into the right hands.
GID00009444	That's not the point. Technology won't win our wars. We need numbers. New recruits.
GID00009445	Huh? Look, man, me and Diane, we don't dig on that politics stuff, savvy? We just make the product and make it get to a good home.
GID00009446	Sure, Caesar's a drag, but as long as we got each other, we don't care who the top dogs roll with.
GID00009447	Huh? Look, kitty cat, me and Diane, we don't dig on that politics stuff, savvy? We just make the product and make it get to a good home.
GID00009448	Sure, Caesar's a drag, but as long as we got each other, we don't care who the top dogs roll with.
GID00009449	Well, it's not like I'm super-attached to working with Caesar or anything, but if it'll stop his patrols from harassing my runners, I'm all for it.
GID00009450	Papa hasn't steered us wrong yet.
GID00009451	I'll see you around.
GID00009452	All right, then. Be patient since this will take awhile.
GID00009453	All right, then. Be patient since this will take awhile.
GID00009454	Have a seat. This will take awhile.
GID00009455	It might not look like much, but it's what keeps us Westside locals independent.
GID00009456	We started it a few years ago. I admit, we had a lot of trouble at first, but eventually we got some help from Tom Anderson with the Followers.
GID00009457	We're finally to the point where the co-op members can start making money from sales instead of just breaking even.
GID00009458	See you later.
GID00009459	Well, I've lived in Nevada all my life. Started out in New Reno, but headed down here as soon as I got the chance.
GID00009460	If you can believe it, things are even worse back home. The whole city's still run by crime families. Used to be the Mordinos and Wrights.
GID00009461	Now it's the Wrights and Van Graffs. Seems like things never get better. Anyway, that's all behind me now.
GID00009462	It was Hector's idea, if you can believe it. He overheard me talking to Anderson about his idea to divert the water over here.
GID00009463	We needed someone to be able to go into the cisterns and get the water out, but any of us would be suspicious. Hector volunteered.
GID00009464	He said that no one pays attention to him, even with his brahmin. Anderson and I argued, but eventually we decided to let him go ahead with it.
GID00009465	Look, this affects all of us, even Hector. What were we supposed to do, let all of our gardens die? Watch Westside fall apart?
GID00009466	Pretty much what you'd expect. White talked to Hector and then went to talk to Anderson.
GID00009467	White made the mistake of assuming that because Anderson's a Follower of the Apocalypse, he wouldn't try anything.
GID00009468	Anderson acted docile, but as soon as White turned to go, Anderson shot him in the back. At least that's what Anderson told me.
GID00009469	Wait... what are you going to do?
GID00009470	You're the one who should be worried. Good luck.
GID00009471	Please, just... don't let them shut down the co-op.
GID00009472	Fuck!
GID00009473	Okay, then.
GID00009474	Come back real soon!
GID00009475	Papa Khan has been talking to Caesar's emissary for weeks now - they're always going on about crushing the NCR.
GID00009476	Papa's announced that if Caesar goes to war against the NCR, the Khans will go with him.
GID00009477	Red Rock Canyon isn't exactly the most hospitable place - there's no food, barely any water, and nothing anybody wants.
GID00009478	We used to send patrols out to acquire supplies, but ever since Bitter Springs there just aren't enough of us left.
GID00009479	Sure, what do you want to know?
GID00009480	We're supplying things people want in exchange for things our tribe needs. Don't judge us.
GID00009481	We make regular shipments to a lot of settlements around the Mojave - a lot of our business comes from the Fiends lately.
GID00009482	Personally, I think they're kind of creepy, but Papa likes the fact that they get hopped up on Psycho and harass NCR patrols.
GID00009483	Like what?
GID00009484	We make the happy stuff. What do you need? Jet, Psycho, a little Med-X to ease the pain?
GID00009485	Whatever.
GID00009486	Naw, man, more like... drug suppliers. Yeah. Other folks sell 'em. Diane's mostly in charge of that.
GID00009487	Naw, kitten, more like... drug suppliers. Yeah. Other folks sell 'em. Diane's mostly in charge of that.
GID00009488	Guess I just had a natural talent for it. When I was a kid, these cats called the Followers of the Apocalypse came to our camp.
GID00009489	They knew all kinds of kooky scientastical stuff, so I ate up all the chemistry they could teach. Diane had the head for business, so we teamed up.
GID00009490	Diane's my girl, man. We've been taking care of each other our whole lives, ever since our folks died. Now we keep the Khans in caps together.
GID00009491	Ah, the other dudes call him Jerry the Punk. That's kind of harsh, though - I think he's just a sensitive soul that needs some love.
GID00009492	He's usually down around the proving ground if you want to say yo.
GID00009493	What's on your brainpan?
GID00009494	And what benefit would this alliance give us?
GID00009495	You want a reason, how about four?
GID00009496	They're called bodyguards, and every one of them is packing. Me, too - so baby makes five.
GID00009497	Add to that every Chairman in this joint is armed, and not with some hold-out peashooter like maybe you smuggled through security.
GID00009498	Anything I needed to worry about, baby, got confiscated at the door.
GID00009499	You're bluffing, baby... Except maybe you're not.
GID00009500	Sweet little caper, getting your weapons back. But let cooler heads prevail, hey? No need for violence.
GID00009501	Take care.
GID00009502	You're already the strongest person I've ever met. The implant won't do anything more for you.
GID00009503	I can implant the Hypertrophy Accelerator for 4,000 caps. It will boost your adrenal glands and quickly increase your muscle mass.
GID00009504	Your eyesight would make a hawk jealous. The Optic Enhancer implant won't do anything more for you.
GID00009505	The Optics Enhancer, as the name suggests, gets attached directly to your optic nerve. The price is 4,000 caps.
GID00009506	Your cardiovascular system is practically super-human. The Nociception Regulator won't boost it any further.
GID00009507	The Nociception Regulator modifies your cardiovascular system, and you won't tire as quickly. The price is 4,000 caps, same as most other implants.
GID00009508	Your higher brain functions are off the charts. The implant won't help at all - sorry.
GID00009509	For 4,000 caps, I can install a Logic Co-Processor.
GID00009510	I think you would really benefit from the Logic Co-Processor implant, so I'm going to cut the price to 3,000.
GID00009511	Your reaction times are already so fast it's a wonder you can't catch bullets. The Reflex Booster can't make you any faster.
GID00009512	The Reflex Booster does exactly what it says - speeds up your reaction times. For 4,000 caps, I can attach the implant to your central nervous node.
GID00009513	All right. Was there something else you were interested in?
GID00009514	So all this time the old man had an entire army on lay-away? Clever player.
GID00009515	Just imagine the look on Baldie's face when those Securitrons come pouring out on judgment day! I'd pay to have that bronzed!
GID00009516	So all you gotta do now is talk to Yes Man, figure out how to set things in motion.
GID00009517	Make Vegas a town I woulda been proud of, baby. Let it swing.
GID00009518	The Brotherhood is failing. I've always known that. If we don't change course, we're going to fall apart or... fade away.
GID00009519	But until recently I haven't understood where we went wrong, or how to fix it.
GID00009520	I think I need to go home.
GID00009521	Okay. Well, when you do, let me know, all right?
GID00009522	Great. Thanks. Thank you. I'll encourage people to name their non-ugly children after you. Seriously.
GID00009523	Sure, yeah. Just not too long, okay? I worry about them sometimes.
GID00009524	Wow, don't everybody volunteer all at once now.
GID00009525	I could do that. You're not interested in coming along? Hate to break up the band over a silly little thing like the future of everyone I care about.
GID00009526	This from the girl who walked from I-15 to the Colorado River looking for her lost package.
GID00009527	This from the guy who walked from I-15 to the Colorado River looking for his lost package.
GID00009528	I hope you change your mind.
GID00009529	Not much for family gatherings, huh? All right, have it your way.
GID00009530	You ever want to look me up again, I'll be in my bunker in Hidden Valley. That's the luxury bunker.
GID00009531	I'm not giving up. He wants evidence, but he'll never go looking for it. He's scared I'm right.
GID00009532	He'll never listen unless I hold the proof right in front of his face.
GID00009533	He's a stubborn old man, but when it comes down to it, he's got our best interests at heart.
GID00009534	If he sees some indisputable sign we're on the wrong course, he won't ignore it.
GID00009535	I don't know. I don't know. We'd need something that shows the Brotherhood will fail. Or that it can do better a different way.
GID00009536	The only thing that'd get his attention is technology.
GID00009537	Huh. Maybe Father Elijah had the right idea.
GID00009538	That's my question to the Elder. All these years, the Brotherhood has collected weapons technology. And for what?
GID00009539	To keep it out of people's hands? That clearly hasn't worked. To defend ourselves? We can't compete with the NCR's numbers. Or the Legion's.
GID00009540	We're fighting a war for a lost cause. If we're going to survive, we have to find a role in society. Attract new members.
GID00009541	Look at the Followers of the Apocalypse. They use their expertise to improve people's lives. They train them to be self-sufficient.
GID00009542	That expertise cultivates respect and gratitude. Spreads their ideals. Draws talent to their cause. They make friends like we make enemies.
GID00009543	But they don't know a fraction of what we know. If we took on their role, we could stand up to anyone. We wouldn't have to hide.
GID00009544	Our Elder before McNamara. He had a nose for recovering lost technology. He'd send Scribes out into the desert chasing whatever leads he found.
GID00009545	There were a few he only trusted me with. I can think of at least one that'd prove my point, if it still exists.
GID00009546	There's a comm terminal not too far from here I'd use to access messages from him. If we go there I can pull up his research on it.
GID00009547	It's a targeting device for some kind of doomsday weapon based at HELIOS One. It was lost sometime after the War.
GID00009548	We held HELIOS One for a time. Lost a lot of people defending it. Too many. All for this weapon they never got working.
GID00009549	If it turns out to be a dud, it'd show how flawed our goals have been. Father Elijah said he thinks a scavenger might have sold it on the Strip.
GID00009550	I'm with you. Being around here isn't the same anymore.
GID00009551	No, but it does make it easier to forgive him. He's just misguided.
GID00009552	It's not too late to change his mind.
GID00009553	Have you considered that he might be senile?
GID00009554	The Brotherhood's strategy for survival worked back when we had a larger force, and no organized enemies.
GID00009555	We're a tiny splinter from a shrinking group. We don't take on new members. But we're still picking fights with the big boys.
GID00009556	Electromagnetic weapon from before the Great War. Experimental. It never saw mass production.
GID00009557	But they were building it as a countermeasure to power armor, which they feared the Chinese were developing.
GID00009558	Supposedly a prototype was being housed at Nellis. Imagine what it could do to the Brotherhood. We'd be on equal footing with any idiot with a gun.
GID00009559	More or less. Supposedly it's a vegetation enhancer. NCR has a science branch headquartered at McCarran airport. Guess they found something.
GID00009560	Guess somebody wasn't very good at keeping secrets, either.
GID00009561	We'd never pursue it because it's not a weapon. But self-sufficiency is fundamental to us. If it works they'd see the value of an alternate course.
GID00009562	Yeah, maybe they'll think twice about engaging the NCR if they know one of those could be floating around.
GID00009563	The notes say to look around Nellis Air Force Base. He suggests going through filing cabinets and computers in the commanding officer's quarters.
GID00009564	They defended HELIOS like it was their last stand. Didn't even know if there was anything worth defending. How could there be, with all we lost?
GID00009565	Even if it did work, it'd be under NCR control now. So it'd either prove our goals are wrong or we're incapable of pursuing them.
GID00009566	There's a pawn shop in Outer Vegas we could check. And I've heard of a gift shop in the Strip that deals in Pre-War antiques.
GID00009567	Okay. What better way to persuade them than to give them a taste of what they stand to gain, right?
GID00009568	Maybe the best place to start is to see what we can find out directly from the NCR. Let's head to their OSI office at McCarran.
GID00009569	I like the way you think.
GID00009570	Well now... the armory could always use more firepower. Very well. Tell the Powder Gangers we accept their offer.
GID00009571	However, they would still have to pass the initiation rite to truly join our ranks.
GID00009572	If you can scout out the camp, bring back any intel on troop movement or plans for future raids. The rangers could put that information to good use.
GID00009573	Also, if you're any good at covert ops, I would love to get a bug planted on their radio. So far, we've been unable to crack their encryption.
GID00009574	What?! How did you pull it off?
GID00009575	Good to hear. This is the bug you'll need for the radio.
GID00009576	Report back if you pick up any intel or manage to sneak the bug into their radio.
GID00009577	Just let me know if you're available for the op. After what they did to Searchlight, they have a shitstorm coming.
GID00009578	That's exactly what we needed to put a cork in that camp. The Legion won't be moving through there anytime soon.
GID00009579	It's a fitting revenge for Searchlight. Thanks for taking care of those bastards for us.
GID00009580	This is more than I could have hoped for! It almost seems too good to be true, but the details are all here.
GID00009581	Looks like they're planning to strike some of the southern caravans. I'll notify the rangers and patrols in that area immediately.
GID00009582	Here are some caps for your trouble. You've done us a great service.
GID00009583	Well, unless you want to go in there and clean out that camp for me, I guess this should be more than enough for now.
GID00009584	What?.. Really?! You're mad, but I like it!
GID00009585	According to the notes you gave me, all of the southern raiding parties come from that camp. Caesar regularly sends fresh squads to relieve patrols.
GID00009586	Killing their Centurion and leadership would be a start, but finding a way to permanently shut down that dock is what we really need.
GID00009587	Report back when the camp is clear. I'll try and shuffle some men in that direction once the Legion is gone.
GID00009588	Yeah, I know I wouldn't sign up for that solo op if asked.
GID00009589	This is more than I could have hoped for! It almost seems too good to be true, but the details are all here.
GID00009590	Looks like they're planning to shift their raids north of Vegas. I'll shift some of the rangers and NCR patrols in that direction when they're free.
GID00009591	Here are some caps for your trouble. You've done us a great service.
GID00009592	Anything else?
GID00009593	What?! How did you pull it off?
GID00009594	That's exactly what we needed to put a cork in that camp. The Legion won't be moving through there anytime soon.
GID00009595	Fitting that the camp was taken care of in a way similar to Searchlight. Thank you for taking care of that place for us.
GID00009596	A single man slaughters an entire camp of legionaries?! I'm amazed.
GID00009597	It took everything we had in the last battle at the dam to stand against those brutes. You're a beast, son.
GID00009598	You've done a fine job, friend. Here is a little something for your work.
GID00009599	A single woman slaughters an entire camp of legionaries?! Oh, that's priceless!
GID00009600	Considering the way Caesar treats women, that should really put some doubts into his troops' minds. Wait til the rangers hear about this!
GID00009601	You've done a fine job, friend. Here's a little something for your work.
GID00009602	Hello Veronica. How goes your mission?
GID00009603	We'll know in a second. I wanted to talk to you.
GID00009604	Veronica, tell me this isn't about-
GID00009605	Yes, goddamn it, it is. But you're going to hear me out this time.
GID00009606	We've been through this.
GID00009607	The things I've seen now. Other groups succeeding where we fail. It's not too late for us.
GID00009608	We've outlasted the end of the world. We'll outlast these upstarts.
GID00009609	Waiting in a hole for everyone else to die.
GID00009610	If we must.
GID00009611	This is a dead end for us.
GID00009612	I see no evidence of that. Nor do I see anyone out there with a solution to our problems.
GID00009613	How could you? You're too scared to look.
GID00009614	Let's go. We're wasting our time.
GID00009615	The Great Khans? Oh, you mean those raiders that used to clash with the Vegas tribes?
GID00009616	Yes, some years back we taught them reading, writing, basic science - we hoped they would use it to make medical supplies, but they turned to drugs.
GID00009617	I was never much involved in the cultural side of that project, but Ezekiel was.
GID00009618	He's a member of the Followers like myself, but his particular field is pre-War history and tribal culture.
GID00009619	I do recall him being fascinated by the Khans, he kept going on about parallels to some ancient historical empire or another.
GID00009620	He rarely stops in here these days - you'd do best to look for him out in the wastes east of New Vegas. He's always looking for new tribes to study.
GID00009621	Was there something else you needed?
GID00009622	Oh my, yes! They're a fascinating tribe with a long and, unfortunately, tragic history.
GID00009623	Their original incarnation, much farther out west, was almost completely wiped out by one of those itinerant heroes so common in the post-War years.
GID00009624	Then of course the "New Khans" suffered a similar fate, some say at the hands of the same hero, though of course the dates are all wrong for that.
GID00009625	Bye.
GID00009626	Finally.
GID00009627	Killing our Bighorners, shooting at the lodge, that sort of thing. It's getting hard to keep people from retaliating.
GID00009628	Guess I can't say for sure if they're NCR. Whoever they are, they want us dead or gone.
GID00009629	Not looking to fight. That'll give NCR an excuse to come up here and wipe us out.
GID00009630	You're human - they might be willing to be listen to what you have to say. Maybe.
GID00009631	I'm not asking you to kill them. Just talk them into leaving. Hell, pay them off if you have to.
GID00009632	Thanks.
GID00009633	All right. Can't say I blame you.
GID00009634	See you.
GID00009635	Yep, get a move on.
GID00009636	Just doing what I'm paid to do - harass the muties until they leave or attack us. If they leave, we let 'em go. If they attack, we wipe them out.
GID00009637	Either way, the job's not done until they've cleared out of the town.
GID00009638	Won't name names, but some important folks in the NCR are sick of muties attacking their Brahmin herds. They want them gone from NCR territory.
GID00009639	Maybe this group had something to do with attacking Brahmin, maybe not. Doesn't matter. We're getting paid to make them go away.
GID00009640	We're still owed half - 2500 caps. Pay up and we'll be on our way. If you're short, maybe you can get the money from the muties.
GID00009641	I'm sure that we can.
GID00009642	You know what? I don't need this bullshit right now. We'll take off that goddamn power armor, if it'll just shut you up.
GID00009643	Yes, yes.
GID00009644	I know, but now that I can see the way out, I'm not so sure. I'd rather not join my dead buddies anytime soon.
GID00009645	I'm going to start heading back to California now. I'm not about to let myself get killed by future NCR incompetence.
GID00009646	If you find my friends, please return their dogtags to the NCR. People need to know what happened here.
GID00009647	If they won't listen, do what you can to make them listen. The dead need to be avenged.
GID00009648	Sure enough, you got me clear of this mess. Here you go.
GID00009649	Sure enough, you got me clear of this mess. Here you go.
GID00009650	This is unacceptable, we demand the immediate return of our power armor.
GID00009651	A battle is about to be fought out there, to come here requesting our men to give up their armor is insane.
GID00009652	It is not your armor, that power armor is property of the Brotherhood of Steel and you have no right to claim it as your own.
GID00009653	Well, if you ask me, what we really need is to get the whole squad out on the practice range - shape up our marksmanship and explosives skill.
GID00009654	I'm sure the others have their own ideas, though.
GID00009655	Are you sure? I've got enough clout to get them started, but these guys are pretty lazy. I doubt they'll want to be pulled in different directions.
GID00009656	Okay, I'll be here if you come to your senses.
GID00009657	You're the boss.
GID00009658	That's right. Folks just don't talk to other folks, and everybody's always cross with each other.
GID00009659	Maybe you just ain't had a healthy dose of human niceness in a while.
GID00009660	Folks just don't talk to other folks, and everybody's always cross with each other.
GID00009661	That'd be swell. Only, if they knew the idea came from me, they probably wouldn't take you serious no more, so maybe you oughta think about it first.
GID00009662	And I sure hope you're more convincing than I am, or they ain't gonna listen.
GID00009663	Okay!
GID00009664	Whatever you think's best.
GID00009665	Excellent! Squad readiness records can be accessed from two terminals at the resort: the main terminal in the lobby or a secure one in a back office.
GID00009666	The main terminal is typically unlocked, but is also in the middle of a major thoroughfare, you'll have to be stealthy to access it.
GID00009667	The office terminal is locked, but you might have an easier time accessing it, especially at night.
GID00009668	As you wish; I'm sure the optimal solution will become apparent to you in time.
GID00009669	Psycho! The big red one! I used to run with the Fiends, I still got the hookups. Smuggle some in and you'll see an improvement.
GID00009670	My man Jack at Red Rock Canyon got the goods. But listen: once you get folks dosed on Psycho, ain't a lot of room for much else.
GID00009671	So if you got any other plans for bulking up the Misfits crew, might want to see about them first.
GID00009672	Right. Head to Red Rock Canyon - that's deep Khan territory, so watch your back. Talk to Jack, tell him Razz wants the usual. See you soon.
GID00009673	Whatever.
GID00009674	[SUCCEEDED] Fine, this isn't worth the trouble to fight over.
GID00009675	[FAILED] No, we have men to outfit and are putting it to good use.
GID00009676	Wait for me downstairs, this won't take long.
GID00009677	[FAILED] Yes, it would be, we can't have outsiders running around using our technology.
GID00009678	[SUCCEEDED] It would mean more people better protected and able to fight.
GID00009679	Well, hurry it up. We don't have much time.
GID00009680	Well, after they migrated to the Mojave, we established relations with them, but that soured when all they wanted was to make drugs.
GID00009681	The NCR eventually took them down quite a bit, but the really fascinating thing about them is the origin of their culture as a whole. You see....
GID00009682	Oh, of course! I'm sorry, I do tend to get wrapped up in my own theories and forget that not everyone finds them as fascinating as I do.
GID00009683	Here, I salvaged this book from an old library. It's a history of a people called the Mongols. I think that's what the Khans built their culture on.
GID00009684	You should read it, it's fascinating stuff.
GID00009685	Groovetastic. Tell him it's on his tab.
GID00009686	Of course I will, dearie, if it's helpful. Don't you worry what will happen to little old me. I'm tougher than I look!
GID00009687	Of course, dearie.
GID00009688	I know that, dearie.
GID00009689	Certainly!
GID00009690	Okay, if you say so. Hell, it's not like we've got a lot to lose here.
GID00009691	Okay, if you say so. Hell, it's not like we've got a lot to lose here.
GID00009692	[SUCCEEDED] That's... brilliant. Simple, yet elegant. I can't believe I didn't think of that.
GID00009693	[FAILED] Neuron decay is rapid after death, and I doubt a live Nightstalker would cooperate with my test.
GID00009694	Sure, maybe not if you're some hulking reprobate like Regis or baked to the gills like Jack. I've tried five times and still haven't made it.
GID00009695	[SUCCEEDED] Maybe you're right. Maybe I can find my true calling, someplace they'll appreciate my poetry! Someplace like the Old Mormon Fort, maybe.
GID00009696	Do you think the Followers of the Apocalypse would take me? I remember all those books they brought us when they visited our tribe.
GID00009697	[FAILED] I don't know... the Khans don't really get me, but at least they're family, you know?
GID00009698	Cheat? The only way I could cheat is if I was so doped up on painkillers that I don't feel anything.
GID00009699	Really? Wow, um... okay. Thanks.
GID00009700	Whoa... you were serious. Okay, yeah, this might just work. Thanks.
GID00009701	Okay.
GID00009702	You've done some great work for us up to this point, and we are hoping to use your unique abilities to aid us once again.
GID00009703	Thanks to the tasks my subordinates have delegated to you, the NCR now has a unique opportunity.
GID00009704	Good, you just stand there and listen, then, that'll make this go faster.
GID00009705	We now have a chance to take the fight to those bastards on their home turf.
GID00009706	I am in the beginning stages of planning out an assault on The Fort. I've made calls to our allies, and they are on their way to our position.
GID00009707	Once our forces are in placed and garrisoned here, we'll begin our assault.
GID00009708	Okay, listen here. Unless we can get some additional support, I'm going to need you to help me resolve this situation.
GID00009709	You need to make your way to this camp they have on the eastern bank and take out the Legate. That should hamstring this attack.
GID00009710	Sir! I don't know what happened, a bunch of Legionnaires just stormed into the power station.
GID00009711	Into the power station? How is that possible?
GID00009712	I don't know sir. There was some talk of them entering through the clogged intake tunnels, but I don't have any confirmation.
GID00009713	On my way up here there was some chatter about their commander, the Legate I think he's called, set up at some kind of base on the eastern bank.
GID00009714	Thanks again for this. You're platinum, baby.
GID00009715	Nowheresville, that's where. Sorry about the double-cross - or are we up to quadruple? - but if someone's gonna die, it's you.
GID00009716	Baby, getting outplayed and getting cheated ain't the same thing.
GID00009717	I get it, you're sore. A crumb's life is painful, full of disappointments.
GID00009718	That temper of yours? Kinda why this conversation's taking place over an intercom.
GID00009719	Do me a favor and stay dead this time, hey? Good night all! It's been a gas...
GID00009720	You don't wanna do that, baby - not without hearing what I got to say first.
GID00009721	Huh...? Hnngk!
GID00009722	[SUCCEEDED] All this is just work ethic run wild, that's your line? I don't know...
GID00009723	Can you get it through your thick skull to leave me and the Chip alone? If bullets can't get through, what hope is there?
GID00009724	[FAILED] Color me unconvinced. The safe bet is to cash you out.
GID00009725	A lifelong-learner is you, hey? Then make your questions count, because your lifelong is running lifeshort.
GID00009726	[SUCCEEDED] Goddammit, I'm actually gonna to let you live. What's come over me?
GID00009727	Scramsville, baby. The Strip and you part ways, dig? You come around me again, you won't be getting back up.
GID00009728	[FAILED] Color me unconvinced. The safe bet is to cash you out.
GID00009729	Zzzz....
GID00009730	Luck is for losers, baby. Someone pulled strings.
GID00009731	It's the House edge, baby. The key to stacking the odds in his favor - or was, until I swiped it.
GID00009732	There's more to it, but we don't have the time. By which I mean you don't.
GID00009733	Angle? I'm head-on, baby, flat-out, all stops pulled, full steam ahead.
GID00009734	Side bets are for losers. I'm playing to win.
GID00009735	Can't do that, baby. The Chip, it's... special. But savor this, baby...
GID00009736	I can comp you the Presidential - best suite in the house. After what you been through, you deserve a taste of the VIP lifestyle.
GID00009737	Give me a moment or two to catch my breath and knock back a few cocktails, and I'll swing by for a meet and greet.
GID00009738	I'll clue you in, guaranteed - every question answered. This can be the start of a beautiful friendship.
GID00009739	Baby, the meet and greet we scheduled in the Presidential? The whole point is to explain why I can't hand the Chip over.
GID00009740	Now let's just forget this little ambush, and meet up in the suite like we planned. How's that sound?
GID00009741	What the fuck...?
GID00009742	It can't work like that, baby - not out in public like this. You really need me to spell that out?
GID00009743	Baby, this is not the place to go talking about that!
GID00009744	Yeah, hello... Well, serves me right for using a 9mm.
GID00009745	House was on to me from word Go? I thought I was being so clever...
GID00009746	Yeah, that's one word for it.
GID00009747	Baby, if ever there was a need for violence, you is it. Just do me a favor and stay dead this time, hey? Ta-ta.
GID00009748	Baby, getting outplayed and getting cheated ain't the same thing.
GID00009749	I get it, you're sore. A crumb's life is painful. But soon you won't feel a thing. Ta-ta.
GID00009750	It was worth a try.
GID00009751	I know, I made a bad first impression. You got every reason to think I'm a creep. But baby, this is an 18 karat opportunity.
GID00009752	I've got the Chip, but to see this shin-dig through to the end? I'm gonna need help. And hello! Who shows up but you?
GID00009753	It can't be a coincidence, baby. You and me were meant to work together.
GID00009754	Baby, wow-ee wow wow! You and me are gonna swing!
GID00009755	Here's the key. I'll be by in a few... just as soon as my legs stop shaking.
GID00009756	Or else what, punk? Or else this?
GID00009757	I'm gonna take a meeting with this pally up in the Prez. You boys wait at the bottom of the elevator. You hear trouble, come up blazing.
GID00009758	You think you scare me? Come on! Do it!
GID00009759	That the best you can do?
GID00009760	I didn't even feel that one!
GID00009761	That's right, gimme another!
GID00009762	I thought this was supposed to hurt!
GID00009763	Come on, ya bum! Put your shoulder into it!
GID00009764	Come on, ya bitch! You swing like a girl!
GID00009765	Check out the digs. Real cozy in here.
GID00009766	I can hardly stand the excitement.
GID00009767	These Legion boys are coo-coo, you realize?
GID00009768	What are you waiting for? Do it!
GID00009769	Come on, end it!
GID00009770	You gonna do it or not?
GID00009771	Happy now, you twisted bitch? Well, I ain't gonna give you the satisfaction.
GID00009772	Happy now, you twisted bum? Well, I ain't gonna give you the satisfaction.
GID00009773	Scram, will ya?
GID00009774	I got nothing to say to you.
GID00009775	Hey, baby! Over here!
GID00009776	I ain't waiting all day, baby.
GID00009777	Baby, I'm dying over here.
GID00009778	Yeah, to die in my sleep at a ripe old age after a marathon session of hey-hey with thirty sex-starved broads. You'll set that up?
GID00009779	Look, I ain't a harbor for illusions. I ain't expecting to get out of this shin-dig alive.
GID00009780	That's why I'm trying to hand you my scheme, baby. It's called having a legacy.
GID00009781	I know, so many options! How do you choose just one?
GID00009782	Yeah... getting butchered like livestock. Something to aspire to.
GID00009783	Yeah, real popular around here. It's a crowd pleaser.
GID00009784	You'd do that for me, baby? Don't tease if you don't mean it.
GID00009785	Now you're talking! That is the ring-a-ding move, baby.
GID00009786	First base is whatever Mr. House would have you do. Follow orders, rig the game to his specifications.
GID00009787	Then, when he ain't looking, you knock him out of the running and find a way to take control of those Securitrons of his.
GID00009788	Go see Yes Man. I made it so that cat can't help but be helpful.
GID00009789	Now you're talking! That is the ring-a-ding move, baby.
GID00009790	First base is do whatever Mr. House would've had you do. Finish rigging the game, then puzzle out how to take over where he left off, dig?
GID00009791	For hows and whats, just talk to Yes Man. I made it so that cat can't help but be helpful.
GID00009792	You cashed out the old man? So how's it feel to end an era?
GID00009793	You got the future of Vegas in the palm of your hand, baby. What happens next is up to you.
GID00009794	Mr. House hides Vegas under his skirt when the bombs fall a thousand years ago, so it belongs to him? Forever? You buy that?
GID00009795	Baby, every boss has a line to explain why he's special, why everyone gotta do what he says. Just figuring that out?
GID00009796	Vegas gotta swing, baby, gotta have pizzazz. Respect where due, but that old man is square to the core.
GID00009797	Ain't we covered this? The only thing not bad about them is they ain't Legion.
GID00009798	The NCR's the biggest gang of thieves in the Mojave, only difference is they pass laws to make their crimes legal before they commit them.
GID00009799	Nah, just spruce it up with a crucifixion here and there. Come closer so I can step on you.
GID00009800	The Legion is twisted, baby - original losers worshipping the king of creeps like he's some kind of god.
GID00009801	They're worse than roaches. My advice? Put on your stomping shoes.
GID00009802	More like two, after what you did to the Omertas.
GID00009803	The Chairmen are true blue. The Omertas are degenerates - never trust them. Or the White Gloves - just something creepy about them.
GID00009804	Set it up right, and the families will roll with your caper. You might have to do some convincing.
GID00009805	Seven years. Took over three days after Mr. House introduced himself.
GID00009806	Our chief at the time, mountain of a guy named Bingo, wanted to stay nomadic. I disagreed, so he challenged me to the knife.
GID00009807	He looked so surprised when I stuck that knife in his neck. Thought he was so tough, but he was so slow.
GID00009808	That's how I made chief. It's how things were back then.
GID00009809	Nah, in the way-back we called ourselves the Boot Riders. Silly name, but that's how we rode the Mojave, dig? - on our feet.
GID00009810	We were nomadic badasses, not to be trifled with. A gang of ruffians, though with a certain panache.
GID00009811	When House gave us the Tops to renovate, his robots dropped off boxes full of suits and ties and wingtip shoes. Told us we were the "Chairmen" now.
GID00009812	That caused an uproar. But I said "the name sticks." Ciao to the old ways, baby - time to swing in style. If the shoes fit, you wear them.
GID00009813	We were east of Vegas when the first Securitron we ever saw rolled up on us. We junked it in a minute flat.
GID00009814	The next day twenty roll up. So we listened.
GID00009815	Said we'd been selected. Vegas needed us to defend it. In exchange, we'd get cushy digs, full stomachs, medical treatment.
GID00009816	Everything a nomad never gets, in other words. Most of the tribe thought we should say no. I thought it was the best idea ever.
GID00009817	No, come on, don't slaughter me like I'm some kind of animal!
GID00009818	Don't do that, baby, not crucifixion. I could be up there for days with those twisted creeps laughing and pointing.
GID00009819	Machetes at twenty paces, hey? I accept your challenge.
GID00009820	I see. Keep it simple, hey? Around here, it's one of the better options...
GID00009821	You sick, twisted fuck!
GID00009822	You sick, vindictive fuck!
GID00009823	You're a class act, baby. Not to say I'm gonna make it easy for you...
GID00009824	I'll believe it when it happens!
GID00009825	The direct approach, hey? Fair enough.
GID00009826	But you should wait until the bunker's taken care of. Caesar won't like it if you eat dessert first.
GID00009827	Nah, I'd rather see it coming.
GID00009828	Do it, baby. Make it clean.
GID00009829	Don't I know it! Too bad a conjugal visit here isn't practical...
GID00009830	Well ain't you a sentimental broad? Gimme a sec to jump off Cloud 9, I'll meet you on the ground...
GID00009831	Oh I made an impression all right! The dent in that mattress was permanent!
GID00009832	Yeah, well, laugh it up on your own time.
GID00009833	That we do, baby, that we do...
GID00009834	Did I say I blamed society? I know why I'm here, baby. Do you?
GID00009835	Didn't leave much choice when you showed up. Like I said, you forced my hand.
GID00009836	Sure, Baldie wants you to go down in the bunker and destroy whatever Mr. House stashed there.
GID00009837	You don't want to do that, baby. Whatever's down in that bunker is the key to the city called Vegas. So here's what you do...
GID00009838	You go down there and use the Chip to do whatever Mr. House woulda wanted you to do. And when you get back to the Strip, you find Yes Man.
GID00009839	I made it so that cat can't help but be helpful, dig?
GID00009840	I prefer the term "relocated."
GID00009841	It took every Stealth Boy I had to cross the river at Cottonwood Cove. That was a close shave, riding a boat full of Legion boys.
GID00009842	Once I was across, I changed into a uniform I swiped off a dead Legionary outside Nelson. Tried to sneak into the bunker, but that didn't work out.
GID00009843	They found the Chip. I wasn't gonna tell them what it was used for, but... let's just say they were persuasive.
GID00009844	What? How could you do that?
GID00009845	You loser! You had Vegas in the palm of your hand and you threw it away?
GID00009846	So all this time the old man had an entire army on lay-away? Clever player.
GID00009847	Just imagine the look on Baldie's face when those Securitrons come pouring out on judgment day! I'd pay to have that bronzed!
GID00009848	So all you gotta do now is talk to Yes Man, figure out how to set things in motion.
GID00009849	Make Vegas a town I woulda been proud of, baby. Let it swing.
GID00009850	Of course, dearie. I know it's dangerous, but it'll all turn out for the best, you'll see. I'll go to him now - it would be rude to keep him waiting!
GID00009851	Lily is eccentric, certainly, but I've never felt she was dangerous. More importantly, she asked if she could help me in some way.
GID00009852	I've told her about the risks, and she still insists on helping me.
GID00009853	I'll be waiting.
GID00009854	Possibly immediate and permanent mental damage. There's a reason the Stealth Boy Mark IIs never got beyond the prototype stage.
GID00009855	Lily already has a pre-existing condition, and the experiment will likely make things worse for her.
GID00009856	The stealth field has been modulated to use less power and thus last longer, but for some reason it has pronounced negative effects on the user.
GID00009857	However, these pronounced effects will allow me to pinpoint exactly what parts of the brain they're affecting.
GID00009858	Unfortunately, I'll need to run the test on a live subject, and Marcus has encouraged me to investigate the Nightstalker mutation first.
GID00009859	Once you're done thinking, talk to Lily.
GID00009860	He's got no resources but a decent cause. We've got plenty of resources and a totally lost cause.
GID00009861	No power armor. No energy weapons. And they're giving the NCR more trouble than we ever did.
GID00009862	Ordinary guys with knives and bullets, and they're taking over Nevada.
GID00009863	There's a lot more troops here than we thought. No wonder we couldn't hold HELIOS One.
GID00009864	A bunch of shut-ins who scorn outsiders and hold technology over them. Gee, where have I heard that one before?
GID00009865	Can't help but be impressed with what they're doing here.
GID00009866	Even the stupid NCR is investing in new research. We're getting left in the dust.
GID00009867	Leading his people to a new land with big dreams and a clean slate. Makes me think of my old mentor.
GID00009868	Holy hell, that's a lot of energy weapons. Guess we dropped the ball on that one.
GID00009869	God, you're not lying, are you? You really did kill them.
GID00009870	In that case, this is for them.
GID00009871	You think? Well good, then. That puts me a little more at ease.
GID00009872	Hey, so where are you headed, anyway?
GID00009873	That seems wise. I think I am, too. Although for how much longer, I'm not sure.
GID00009874	Not very friendly, are they?
GID00009875	Well, thanks for weighing in. Gives me something to think about.
GID00009876	Wow. I've got to admit, you have completely defied my first impression of you.
GID00009877	Eye lasers. I'll be sure and look out for that next time.
GID00009878	Any other juicy bits of intel?
GID00009879	Ooo. Very exciting. Gonna strike it rich, huh?
GID00009880	Huh. Just on your way to do a little heavily fortified sightseeing. Kind of a thrillseeker, aren't you?
GID00009881	Just wherever the wind takes you, huh? I like that. Keeps things interesting.
GID00009882	I'll be honest. You're the first person I've run across out here that looks like he can really handle himself.
GID00009883	I'll be honest. You're the first person I've run across out here that looks like she can really handle herself.
GID00009884	There are places I've never been to that'd be too dangerous for just me. What do you think? Maybe we could travel together, help each other out.
GID00009885	Guess we have that in common, then.
GID00009886	This is quite a journey you're going on, then. Must be an interesting relationship to have brought you all this way.
GID00009887	Heh. Good. That's the look I was going for. Trust me on this one, though. You'll be glad you brought me along.
GID00009888	If I turn out to be a burden, we can part ways at any time. No hard feelings.
GID00009889	Oh, nowhere in particular, really. Just hoping to see more of the world. Looking for a fresh perspective.
GID00009890	I want to see how different groups have adapted to survive in the Mojave. See if there's something I can learn from.
GID00009891	Now you're talking. One thing you should know, first, though. I asked you about the Brotherhood because I'm one of them.
GID00009892	I know, I know. But I had to know how you'd react when I told you. We've made a lot of enemies.
GID00009893	You still okay bringing me along?
GID00009894	Aw, you really know how to make a girl feel like a stray cat.
GID00009895	But okay. My offer stands, if we run into each other again.
GID00009896	Suit yourself. You can always change your mind.
GID00009897	Like I said, they can handle themselves. And I'm not the only one getting supplies for them. It's a big family.
GID00009898	Good. I hoped you'd come around. Shall we?
GID00009899	I'm great at punching people. I'm not gonna lie. It's a gift.
GID00009900	Well, thanks for taking a chance on a naive young girl from California with stars in her eyes and a pneumatic gauntlet on her hand.
GID00009901	Let's hit the road, huh?
GID00009902	Sure. Just don't ever ask me if your outfit makes you look fat.
GID00009903	Fair enough. Maybe one day I'll have your complete trust, and I can be on a long leash. A girl can dream.
GID00009904	I like long walks in the desert and candle-lit metal workshops.
GID00009905	My favorite subject.
GID00009906	He was dead when I got there.
GID00009907	This better not be about the meaning of life.
GID00009908	Well, when two people really love each other... you really don't know this stuff yet?
GID00009909	Ooo, do I get a prize if I answer right?
GID00009910	I was told we wouldn't be tested on this.
GID00009911	A lifetime supply of Fancy Lads Snack Cakes, revenge against my enemies, and world peace. In that order.
GID00009912	I was young and I needed the money.
GID00009913	It's a free wasteland.
GID00009914	Yeah. They say he built the Strip. Of course, they say a lot of things. No one's actually met him.
GID00009915	Me? I think it's a hoax. Probably a group of people who want to avoid attention, or some made-up persona of a self-aware computer.
GID00009916	Why else would he shut himself in like that?
GID00009917	Yeah. It's not for poker.
GID00009918	I've never seen anything quite like it, but I can tell you it looks like it was fabricated before the War, and not at a mint.
GID00009919	Some kind of tech... I'm gonna say... mid-2200s. Hold onto it. Might be your lucky chip.
GID00009920	Sure, he's one of the hotel managers on the Strip. He comes up in the news now and then.
GID00009921	Him and the other Chairmen run the Tops. It's one of the nicer hotels, or so I hear.
GID00009922	Elder McNamara wouldn't shell out for a passport for me, so I've actually never been to the Strip. Why do people get so cheap when they get old?
GID00009923	Yep. It's your typical city layout. Rich people in a gated community surrounded by extreme poverty.
GID00009924	House gave the area around the Strip to the locals, but he has no interest in it, so he ignores it entirely. It just needs new management.
GID00009925	I'd love to see the Brotherhood do it, but since the Codex doesn't say "clean up Freeside" no one listens to me. Bunch of sticklers.
GID00009926	I'm worried they'll be the death of the Brotherhood. They take what they want. We defend our interests to the death.
GID00009927	But there's a handful of us and tens or hundreds of thousands of them. So it's not going to end well.
GID00009928	Last time we clashed we lost a lot of people. Retreated to our bunker. Now we're afraid to even move around during the day.
GID00009929	Silliest dressed band of raping, slaving marauders you'll see east of California, I'll say that. Where's that touch of Old World class?
GID00009930	Although I hear the soldiers mount each other as much as they mount their women, so maybe they did keep a little something from the Empire.
GID00009931	No such privilege for the women, though. Figures. So... to answer your question... they're a bunch of hypocritical jerkwads. It's a word.
GID00009932	Darn it, I had some spectacular answers coming, too.
GID00009933	Let's.
GID00009934	Thanks for your support. I'll make sure that the NCR Emergency radio is up and running. Go kill those bastards.
GID00009935	Like I said earlier, we have some supplemental forces on the way, but this wasn't the situation I was expecting, so I can only offer what is on hand.
GID00009936	All right. I'll dismantle the prototype to avoid any further incidents with the Nightkin.
GID00009937	Very well. It will be worth it, I'm sure.
GID00009938	I'm close to the cure, I can feel it. Lily's continued help will give me the last bit of data that I need.
GID00009939	I understand. Get back to me with an answer as soon as you can.
GID00009940	Permanent damage to her mind is a certainty. Even the cure won't help her.
GID00009941	Fucking Cooke has us trapped here. After we escaped from an NCR prison, he dragged us around the wasteland until we ended up in this shit hole.
GID00009942	A group of us want to leave, go back to the NCR and surrender. But Cooke won't let us.
GID00009943	After you cut off access to the sulfur, Cooke left. I guess we're free to surrender to the NCR now.
GID00009944	We're waiting on you. A lot of us are interested in joining the Khans.
GID00009945	Cooke is just an overambitious prick, and he's going to get us all killed.
GID00009946	I'm a nobody. Just a survivor. Things were well enough until the NCR threw me behind bars.
GID00009947	I made my living sneaking into NCR camps looking for shit to steal. I got sloppy, and then I got caught.
GID00009948	Made it out during Cooke's big prison break, like the rest of the guys here.
GID00009949	Samuel Cooke. It was his idea to organize a jailbreak, but now he's just an overambitious prick who's going to get us all killed.
GID00009950	I can be pretty sneaky when I need to be, and the prison guards were a joke.
GID00009951	So when Cooke told me his plan, I spread the info to anyone that might be useful.
GID00009952	Cooke organized the breakout. But he's just an overambitious prick who's going to get us all killed.
GID00009953	You won't get a fucking cap from me, and you're lucky I don't blow your goddamn head off.
GID00009954	The whole point of killing the geckos was so we could get at the sulfur and you've just made that a hell of a lot more difficult. Now fuck off.
GID00009955	Everybody has to do it. Well, everybody who wants to be a Khan, anyways. They toss you into the ring there and beat on you for a solid minute.
GID00009956	If you survive, you're in.
GID00009957	I don't think so. You already have a dog right there.
GID00009958	I don't know about that...
GID00009959	I brush it every day. One hundred brushes.
GID00009960	Okay. Take good care of him and bring him back when you're done.
GID00009961	You know what? I think it's best if he stays with me.
GID00009962	Okay. Anything else?
GID00009963	Make it quick.
GID00009964	No problem. Glad I could help out.
GID00009965	More than you already have? Might want to ask around, but truth is, you've already helped out a lot in the short time you've been here.
GID00009966	I suppose you could talk to Ghost, up on top of the barracks - uh, Ranger Ghost. Something about trouble in Nipton, maybe.
GID00009967	Help? Oh, well... you could speak to Ranger Jackson. He might have something for you.
GID00009968	He sort of runs things around here, mostly ends up sending reports back West that aren't filled with the best news.
GID00009969	All right then... just sign here, here, and... here.
GID00009970	Wow, you have come a long way, then. I've never been there, but I've met some traders who pass that way.
GID00009971	Well, welcome, then. I'm Veronica. I live in a hole in the ground.
GID00009972	Huh. Well, in that case I take it back. You look pretty good, given the circumstances.
GID00009973	Yeah, guess the roads must've been long, then, if you forgot where you started from.
GID00009974	That's why I asked. My business is boring. You try trading and scavenging for a living and see if you don't start nosing into other people's affairs.
GID00009975	Well, a bunker, if you want to get technical. I think it sounds more interesting my way.
GID00009976	But I'm not there much anymore. I'm usually out here picking up food and supplies for my family. Whatever they need.
GID00009977	Yeah. I'm not worried. They can handle themselves. But somebody has to get the groceries, know what I mean?
GID00009978	And actually these days I think they'd rather have me out here anyway. But that's a whole other story.
GID00009979	So, listen, can I ask you something on the level?
GID00009980	I had a run-in with this group calling themselves the Brotherhood of Steel. Pretty strange bunch. Do you know anything about them?
GID00009981	Forget I said anything, then.
GID00009982	Sure. It's a small wasteland. I'm sure we'll run into each other again.
GID00009983	And?
GID00009984	Well that shouldn't be a problem for me. I can't afford anything like that.
GID00009985	Oh my gosh, really? Well, I didn't see where they went, but I'll keep an eye out. Wow, I had no idea they were so dangerous.
GID00009986	Thanks for letting me know. Glad I didn't do any business with them.
GID00009987	Do they? That's a relief. I wasn't so sure, myself. Protecting people from technology seems like a big job for such a small group.
GID00009988	Yeah, it's pretty far out, right? Fixating on old technology just doesn't seem very relevant to most people's lives.
GID00009989	That bad, huh? Guess I'm lucky I got away with my life. I'll make sure and avoid them from now on. Thanks.
GID00009990	That's okay, I wouldn't expect anybody to. I think they tend to keep to themselves.
GID00009991	I have to watch Cooke. I wouldn't put it past him to just start killing the opposition, starting with me.
GID00009992	Thanks. Take this keycard - I tried hacking the locking mechanisms on the doors, but it seems that the only way in is with one of these.
GID00009993	Cooke is planning to use the sulfur to make bigger explosives.
GID00009994	Will you check out the caves and see if there's anything you can do?
GID00009995	Without access to the sulfur, he'll lose what influence he has left with the men here.
GID00009996	Good to hear. Without access to the sulfur, Cooke doesn't have much to offer the gang. I... I guess it's over, then. We can turn ourselves in.
GID00009997	Well, that's a hell of a lot better than going back to prison.
GID00009998	We can't survive like this - there are too many of us and we don't have the resources. And maybe it's the right thing to do.
GID00009999	[FAILED] No, this needs to end. I'm tired of running and living like scavengers.
GID00010000	[SUCCEEDED] I hadn't thought of that. Would you be willing to talk to them on our behalf?
GID00010001	Thank you. I think I just needed to hear someone else say it. I suppose without rule of law, we're no better than raiders.
GID00010002	Thank you. We'll wait here until we hear from you.
GID00010003	That coward Lem has been talking about surrendering to the NCR. Now the men are confused, not sure who's leading this gang. Fucking idiots.
GID00010004	Lem's been taken care of. We can start mining that sulfur now, thanks to you.
GID00010005	Some of the computers still work, but the only files are diaries and garbage. Typical vault.
GID00010006	You really don't know? I'm Samuel Cooke. I was the brains behind the NCRCF prison break.
GID00010007	Their "republic" is a joke. They're a bunch of tyrants led by an even greater tyrant, that idiot Kimball.
GID00010008	They think they have the right to annex every inch of dirt in the West and force their system on every man, woman, and child.
GID00010009	He was an inmate like the rest of us. He had his uses, but he's a coward and a troublemaker.
GID00010010	He was an inmate like the rest of us. He was useful during the jailbreak, but now...
GID00010011	He's just another coward. He wants us to leave the vault and hand our asses to the NCR, as if they'd treat us like human beings.
GID00010012	I was blowing up supply caravans along the 15 freeway. The NCR got wise to my ambush spots, picked me up and threw me in a cage.
GID00010013	A beautiful thing. Saved a little blast powder here, hid a makeshift weapon there, and one day I orchestrated a little symphony for the NCR.
GID00010014	Didn't have a choice. He was confusing the men, and I need to control them or we're just a bunch of disorganized idiots.
GID00010015	I have to keep an eye on that bastard Lem. The second I turn my back, he might go crying to the NCR.
GID00010016	So, what do you say? You going to take care of those geckos?
GID00010017	Explosives. Bombs. Big, big fucking bombs. You gonna help us or not?
GID00010018	There aren't enough of us here to make a real impact on the NCR, and the Khans probably hate the NCR more than we do. Strength in numbers, they say.
GID00010019	So, will you talk to Papa Khan on our behalf?
GID00010020	Great. Come back as soon as you can.
GID00010021	Great. Get to it. Oh, and take this - there's some weird shit with this Vault's security and some doors will only open if you have a keycard.
GID00010022	Heard there was an abandoned vault along this mountain ridge, and that the wildlife here had teeth big enough to keep the NCR away.
GID00010023	It's a fucking deathtrap around here. Fiends swarm all over Vault 3 in the east, and there are fucking Deathclaws south of that, at Quarry Junction.
GID00010024	If you're looking for humans, the Khans are north of us and an NCR base at McCarran, past Vault 3. Supposedly there are muties to the southeast.
GID00010025	Like raiders, but worse - these guys are messed up on every damn chem there is. You can spot them by the horned skulls they wear as hats.
GID00010026	The NCR's been mining there for awhile, but now it's full of Deathclaws. Don't go there unless you want a quick, bloody death.
GID00010027	It's the main base for the NCR, and a breeding ground for oppression in the name of patriotic bullshit. Do humanity a favor and blow it up.
GID00010028	They've been through some rough times, but they can hold their own. I wouldn't mind taking the boys and signing up with them, if it weren't for Lem.
GID00010029	I've heard the muties there are different. Completely insane, and supposedly they use some kind of invisibility technology. I'd stay away.
GID00010030	Good. Hey, I got another job for you if you're interested.
GID00010031	I'd rather not, but fair enough. We'll do it.
GID00010032	Yeah, whatever.
GID00010033	You must be crazy if you're just "passing through" this place.
GID00010034	Then why are you in here bothering me instead of out there hunting them?
GID00010035	Look, I don't need your shit. Either get out of the way or things are gonna get rough.
GID00010036	Look if you really want to help either get the fuck out of our way or hack that damn computer over there.
GID00010037	All I know is that the whole place is filled with radiation, there are nasty creatures roaming about.
GID00010038	And that my employer is paying me a pretty penny to loot it.
GID00010039	Some caravan company, Crimson something or other. Some old broad said they're looking to expand their business, be more competitive or some shit.
GID00010040	I don't really care, so long as I get paid.
GID00010041	The location of some radiation suits. I found an inventory list that says they should be here but I can't seem to find them anywhere.
GID00010042	The computer should know what happened to them.
GID00010043	Yeah you do that.
GID00010044	Well then, get your ass out there.
GID00010045	[FAILED] Fuck you. You'll get the same as everyone else.
GID00010046	[SUCCEEDED] Alright, fine, but you gotta bring us those suits first.
GID00010047	Good, now get going.
GID00010048	Just go already.
GID00010049	Good, we're going to the Police Station first. Here's the key, we'll follow you there.
GID00010050	And just so you know, I'm not leaving town until I get what I came for. If you decide to go wandering off somewhere else, don't expect me to follow.
GID00010051	Well hurry the fuck up, I don't wanna wait all day.
GID00010052	What?
GID00010053	We're gonna check out the police and fire stations. They were the buildings used the most by the NCR, so they're our best chance at good shit.
GID00010054	I found the keys on one of the trooper corpses.
GID00010055	Anything that's valuable. You done with the questions yet?
GID00010056	It's about damn time.
GID00010057	Anything else?
GID00010058	[SUCCEEDED] You've got a point. Selling meds to the locals could be a pretty nice side gig. All right, I'll tell Jack to give it a try.
GID00010059	[FAILED] That's touching, but it would take away from our bottom line. I'll have to pass.
GID00010060	Here you go, you've earned these.
GID00010061	Here you go. Enjoy it.
GID00010062	[SUCCEEDED] Whoa... you're right. I should start a side project making meds to keep my aura clean.
GID00010063	[FAILED] I don't know what you've been smoking, but where can I get some?
GID00010064	[SUCCEEDED] Right on, let's have it!
GID00010065	[FAILED] Cool. Maybe later.
GID00010066	[SUCCEEDED] Right on, let's have it!
GID00010067	[FAILED] Cool. Maybe later.
GID00010068	[SUCCEEDED] Right on, let's have it!
GID00010069	[FAILED] Cool. Maybe later.
GID00010070	[SUCCEEDED] Right on, let's have it!
GID00010071	[FAILED] Cool. Maybe later.
GID00010072	[SUCCEEDED] Right on, let's have it!
GID00010073	[FAILED] Cool. Maybe later.
GID00010074	Cool. Maybe later.
GID00010075	I don't have any compelling reason to trust you, given your behavior. So no, I'm not really inclined to give you a job.
GID00010076	Hmm... you look like you could handle yourself in a fix. All right, I'll tell you what. Anders, one of my best runners, is overdue to report back.
GID00010077	If you can find out what happened to him, I'll give you some real work.
GID00010078	Great! Here's your payment.
GID00010079	And you didn't even get skinned alive. I'm impressed. Here's your payment.
GID00010080	Like I said, find Anders first, then we'll see about trusting you with more work.
GID00010081	Yeah, you did good finding him. Okay, if you want a little work, I think I can find you something.
GID00010082	Okay, if you want a little work, I think I can find you something.
GID00010083	Not right at the moment, but you could talk to Jack - he's always looking for new recipes.
GID00010084	Ordinarily I would, but it seems like all our clients have ended up dead. You could talk to Jack - he's always looking for new recipes.
GID00010085	Diane handles most of the transactional elements of this little enterprise, but I'm always in the market for new recipes if you've got the spark.
GID00010086	Already on it. I whipped up a few Stimpaks already, but if you've got any more recipes I'll take them.
GID00010087	What do you mean, helpful? My stuff already makes people feel groodalicious.
GID00010088	Yeah, you made a pretty good argument. We'll keep it small for now, but if it turns a profit we might expand.
GID00010089	Helpful? What, like bathtub Stimpaks? What's the point of that?
GID00010090	Oh, you're buying? Cool.
GID00010091	Oh, you're buying? Tell you what, since you've been acting all, well, random lately, how about a discount? Might calm you down.
GID00010092	Jack handles the small-time purchases. You should talk to him unless you're looking for a major shipment.
GID00010093	Right on. What have you got?
GID00010094	We've got an associate in the Crimson Caravan Trading Company who distributes for us in Outer Vegas. He's been after us for a new shipment.
GID00010095	Groodalicious. That ought to rake in the caps. What do I owe you?
GID00010096	About three weeks ago I sent Anders southeast to find a route into Arizona to open new markets for our product.
GID00010097	He should have been back two days ago, but there's been no sign of him.
GID00010098	Okay then. Job'll be waiting if you change your mind.
GID00010099	Thanks. Prove you're reliable on this, and I'll have more for you later.
GID00010100	With Anders out of commission for so long, we're shorthanded on runners, and some backlogs have piled up.
GID00010101	We've got an associate in the Crimson Caravan Trading Company who distributes for us in Outer Vegas. He's been after us for a new shipment.
GID00010102	You up for something challenging?
GID00010103	I've got a shipment of Jet and Psycho that needs to be delivered to Motor Runner at Vault 3.
GID00010104	Great. Here's the package - your contact is Don Hostetler at the Crimson Caravan. Come back and see me when you're done.
GID00010105	Don't get cocky, the Fiends are twitchy. Most of them won't bother a Khan, but the ones outside the Vault... well, they're outside for a reason.
GID00010106	Here's the package - good luck. Your payment will be waiting when you get back.
GID00010107	Don't get cocky, the Fiends are twitchy. Most of them won't bother a Khan, but the ones outside the Vault... well, they're outside for a reason.
GID00010108	Here's the package - good luck. Your payment will be waiting when you get back.
GID00010109	About goddamn time. Tell the Khans if they can't keep a steady supply, we'll find someone who can.
GID00010110	Huh? Oh! Oh, right. Yeah. I'll take that. You should go now, before you draw any attention.
GID00010111	Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
GID00010112	Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
GID00010113	Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
GID00010114	Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
GID00010115	Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
GID00010116	Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
GID00010117	Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
GID00010118	Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
GID00010119	Caps it is. Will there be anything else?
GID00010120	Here's your NCR money. Will there be anything else?
GID00010121	Very well. Will there be anything else?
GID00010122	Enjoy your stay at The Tops.
GID00010123	Let's see... good guard dog tendencies. If I transplant this brain into Rex, he'll be a bit more ferocious in his attacks.
GID00010124	Rex will be faster.
GID00010125	Rex will be tougher.
GID00010126	All right, if you want.
GID00010127	Ha! How do you like that you sons of bitches?!
GID00010128	Ahhh!...
GID00010129	You sick bastard, I could have shot you! You must be the backup I've been calling for.
GID00010130	Where are the rest of your men?
GID00010131	My army has been ready for some time now. My orders were to await the coming of a messenger.
GID00010132	You are messenger and message both, it would seem.
GID00010133	I am the commander of this army. The Son of Mars has granted me the name Lanius. And the time to serve him has come once more.
GID00010134	Our forces are better equipped to take objectives than hold them. I do not wish to defend this place if another option exists.
GID00010135	Our opponents follow a strict chain of command, which is both a strength and weakness. I intend to use you to strike at that weakness.
GID00010136	Find the enemy commander, this General Oliver. Kill him or his resolve. Do this, and his cowards will retreat, leaving the dam to us.
GID00010137	The word means "butcher" in Latin. I was granted the name after proving myself in several battles.
GID00010138	Perhaps after today's battle, you too will earn yourself a new name.
GID00010139	I live to serve Caesar's will - and the will of the Legion. If my victory serves them both, then I am pleased.
GID00010140	They are passable foes. Like their citizens, they prefer their war from a distance, and at that, they excel.
GID00010141	Their leaders have on occasion shown brilliance, their rangers in particular have adapted well to our strategies.
GID00010142	But their rangers are few, and this General Oliver we face is not their best. I regret not being able to face Hanlon, the one who led them last time.
GID00010143	Their men take comfort in - and rely on - killing at a distance. They will not have the luxury of such comforts this time.
GID00010144	Our warriors will wash over them in a tide of blood, severing arms before they can attack, legs before they can run, and heads before they can pray.
GID00010145	So yes, fortune favors our chances, messenger. Provided *you* move quickly.
GID00010146	In the past, the NCR has relied upon attrition, withering our numbers with ranged fire and falling back as necessary.
GID00010147	Not this time. The dam contains tunnels to its heart, overlooked by the NCR... now occupied by the Legion.
GID00010148	When the battle begins, the NCR will find our teeth at their throats in a dozen places. There will be no attrition, no falling back, only carnage.
GID00010149	It was not intended for war - its top sides are bound to two intake towers by a series of bridges. No doubt snipers nest there.
GID00010150	On the far side of the dam, a small building provides access to the power plant below. That is where Oliver hides.
GID00010151	Then ask them. But don't waste my time. The battle draws near.
GID00010152	Mars's eyes are upon you. Do not fail him - or us.
GID00010153	I'm not sure what you mean. I think you have me confused with someone else.
GID00010154	Well that's too bad. I'm just here to enjoy the show so if you don't mind...
GID00010155	Then leave me alone.
GID00010156	What the... how'd you...
GID00010157	For the Legion!
GID00010158	You will regret this.
GID00010159	Die, Profligate!
GID00010160	Sorry, that just ain't gonna happen.
GID00010161	For Caesar!
GID00010162	Yeah, thought so.
GID00010163	I don't have time for this.
GID00010164	Death to the Legion's enemies!
GID00010165	Bad idea.
GID00010166	Die, infidel!
GID00010167	Oh shit... really? We should go take a look!
GID00010168	Settle down. No one uses the radio until I know what's going on.
GID00010169	Okay, lead the way!
GID00010170	We're just going to be a moment. We should both take a look first.
GID00010171	Uh... I think I should check it out first before radioing it in.
GID00010172	It's your own fault for finding this - now I'm going to have to kill you.
GID00010173	Fuck it, you're more trouble than you're worth.
GID00010174	[SUCCEEDED] No, I didn't, not until now anyway. Very well, human. You've made your point, and I withdraw my... request.
GID00010175	[FAILED] No more negotiating, and definitely no more waiting. This is your last chance before we take it by force.
GID00010176	There are caches of Stealth Boys out there. With the Mark II in hand, it shouldn't be difficult to upgrade every one of them.
GID00010177	Our lives, our decision to make. We're tired of sitting around in Jacobstown waiting for a cure.
GID00010178	Good, good. Smart move, human.
GID00010179	I knew humans could never be reasonable! I knew it! Stupid, stupid humans! I'll kill you!
GID00010180	[FAILED] I may be angry, but I'm not stupid.
GID00010181	[SUCCEEDED] You're right, I should.
GID00010182	Sure.
GID00010183	Sure.
GID00010184	Karl sends his regards.
GID00010185	You don't give up, do you?
GID00010186	You've been a persistent annoyance. I had hoped to avoid this, but it seems I have no choice but to deal with you myself.
GID00010187	Caesar thinks he can change human nature. Most of the Legion is following Caesar, not Caesar's ideals. When he's gone, it'll crumble.
GID00010188	Might not happen overnight. Might take a few decades. But it'll happen. Basic human nature - greed, ambition, jealousy - will see to it.
GID00010189	They expand, fast. If you've got land they want, they'll take it, eventually. Did it out West, they'll do it here.
GID00010190	They keep rolling over people, they'll regret it. That's how revolutions start.
GID00010191	Seen them grow from a single town - Shady Sands - into the republic. They've done good for the most part.
GID00010192	Not really. Heard it's paradise in the wasteland. Never been in there myself, doubt they'd let a mutant in.
GID00010193	Amazes me people would come from all over the wastes to throw away everything they've got in that town.
GID00010194	When I command you to complete a mission, you will complete it, or you should die in the attempt.
GID00010195	You lost me a great opportunity to deal a blow to the Profligates' morale. If not for the service you've rendered unto me, I'd have you crucified.
GID00010196	I will overlook this error, but only because I think you can still be useful.
GID00010197	I want you to destroy whatever you find in there. And then I want you to come back here and tell me about it.
GID00010198	So go to the building and take this fucking Platinum Chip with you. My Legionaries will meet you there, with your weapons and equipment.
GID00010199	Talk to Benny on your way out. He knows I'm going to let you decide how he dies. Maybe you want to remind him.
GID00010200	Goodbye.
GID00010201	I'm not asking you to do this. I'm telling you.
GID00010202	Now take the Platinum Chip, go down in that bunker or whatever it is, and destroy whatever gizmo-happy Brahmin shit you find. Now get to it. Vale.
GID00010203	I'm not asking you to do this. I'm telling you.
GID00010204	Now take the Platinum Chip, go to the bunker or whatever it is, and destroy whatever gizmo-happy Brahmin shit you find down there.
GID00010205	And just in case you're thinking of slipping away, now that you've finally got that Platinum Chip in your hands?
GID00010206	Go ahead, try that. And I'll have you hunted down, and your head mounted on a pole. Now get to it. Vale.
GID00010207	Cyber-dogs and the like. It's not a field I work in much anymore.
GID00010208	Yes, but the leadership and I didn't see eye to eye, so I left. It was the right decision, since the Enclave's oil rig was destroyed not long after.
GID00010209	Good. The President doesn't arrive until tomorrow. Get some rest, I'll brief you in the morning.
GID00010210	Make it quick.
GID00010211	Ask your questions, but keep it short.
GID00010212	Glad you could join us. Most of my men are already on duty and the crowd has already started gathering outside.
GID00010213	We've got a busy day ahead of us.
GID00010214	We trust you, so you're free to have your weapons. Just don't do anything too crazy and we'll back you up.
GID00010215	You'll be allowed to carry your weapons, but they must remain holstered.
GID00010216	If you pull them out, my men will shoot you. Understand?
GID00010217	Security detail consists of rangers stationed here at the dam. Some will keep an eye on the crowd while others will watch the perimeter.
GID00010218	Snipers and sharpshooters have been assigned to key locations and we also have a special K9 unit sniffing out members of the crowd.
GID00010219	I've also locked down access to critical locations such as the landing platform on the visitor center.
GID00010220	I have a full itinerary here. Here you go.
GID00010221	The President arrives, gives a speech, and then leaves. That's all someone like you needs to know.
GID00010222	The Legion will definitely try something, but we don't have any solid leads yet.
GID00010223	I'd almost expect something direct from them, but given the circumstances there's a possibility of something more subtle like sabotage.
GID00010224	But since we don't have anything solid we'll just have to keep our eyes out for anything out of the ordinary.
GID00010225	Possible security threats... there was a new guy allowed to help with security at the last minute. Other than that, we don't have any solid leads.
GID00010226	Someone like you... I'm just glad to have you on board. Do whatever you can. Security sweeps, talk to people, keep an eye out.
GID00010227	Keep an eye on the crowd and keep an eye out for anything suspicious. Other than that, just stay out of the way.
GID00010228	The plan is to get through today without the shit hitting the fan.
GID00010229	So I'll be overseeing the security team personally and keeping in constant contact with people over the radio.
GID00010230	It's a good bet that the Legion is going to try something today so we have to be prepared for anything.
GID00010231	We'll do whatever it takes to get the President through this visit in one piece.
GID00010232	President Kimball is arriving shortly. If you want to do any last minute security sweeps or take a look around for anything suspicious, do it now.
GID00010233	Once you're ready, meet me outside on the observation deck, but don't take too long.
GID00010234	Good. The President doesn't arrive until tomorrow. Let's get some rest and we'll have a brief talk first thing in the morning.
GID00010235	If there's nothing else, then let's get moving.
GID00010236	Alright, I'll give you full access.
GID00010237	Not a chance. Only the necessary personnel have authorization.
GID00010238	Well I'm glad I have your approval.
GID00010239	If there's nothing else, then let's get moving.
GID00010240	Maybe now I can get my old life back, or at least most of it.
GID00010241	It's not much, but I want you to have this. Thanks for your help.
GID00010242	[FAILED] I'm still not so sure about that.
GID00010243	[SUCCEEDED] Guess it can't hurt to say hello.
GID00010244	I know that this place was originally a mining town before the NCR took it over. I think they mined gold before the war.
GID00010245	Sorry I don't know much more than that.
GID00010246	Alright.
GID00010247	[FAILED] Sorry, I'm not giving it to you.
GID00010248	[SUCCEEDED] You're probably right. Here, take it.
GID00010249	[FAILED] Bullying me won't make me give it to you.
GID00010250	[SUCCEEDED] Fine, here. Take it. Just leave me alone.
GID00010251	Suffering? I may be suffering but I still want to live. You tell that bastard that I have every intention of doing so.
GID00010252	I'll kill you for that!
GID00010253	Sure.
GID00010254	What do you want to know?
GID00010255	Sure.
GID00010256	What? No, he... what do you mean, aren't allowed to serve? Why would he lie about that?
GID00010257	That lying little weasel! I almost fell for it, too! All right, you've got a deal. You can tell Papa I won't support an alliance.
GID00010258	I'm afraid not. Our instructions were very specific. You have to die.
GID00010259	I hope you'll be a half-decent challenge.
GID00010260	Aieee!
GID00010261	Ave Caesar!
GID00010262	Oh God help us!
GID00010263	I haven't heard anything like that. Do you have any proof?
GID00010264	Okay, come on back when you do.
GID00010265	Okay, I won't bother.
GID00010266	[SUCCEEDED] Dude! What a total haul! No way that's copasheshy. Yeah, okay, me and Diana got your back. No sweat.
GID00010267	[FAILED] Dude... wait, what? That's totally kakadoodle, man. You been huffing fumes in the Magic Bus or something?
GID00010268	Well-spoken.
GID00010269	Noooooooo!
GID00010270	[SUCCEEDED] Of course I am! That is to say, Caesar has many fine warriors, and I wouldn't wish to compare them to the Great Khans.
GID00010271	[FAILED] You insult our hosts, where I wouldn't dare to. You might want to watch that talk around Papa Khan.
GID00010272	[SUCCEEDED] Enough! How dare you compare Caesar's finest to this tribe of savages? The mightiest Great Khan is scarcely a match for a Legion recruit!
GID00010273	The Burned Man would leave their mightiest shitting themselves in terror! I would... Uhhh, that is....
GID00010274	[FAILED] Win? I wasn't aware we were competing.
GID00010275	You motherless bastard. You'll pay for this!
GID00010276	I suppose if asked, I would. But that's a moot point, because Papa's in charge now, and he's not going anywhere.
GID00010277	Doesn't he? Caesar's representative tells a different tale.
GID00010278	The glory of the Great Khans will be restored, and once the NCR is pushed back to California, all the land from here to the Colorado will be ours.
GID00010279	I won't hear any more talk against Caesar or his alliance. The Great Khans will answer Caesar's call to war, and the NCR will pay for their crimes.
GID00010280	Hah! The Great Khans will not be slaves. Caesar himself has promised us the land from here to the Colorado and the freedom to raid as we see fit.
GID00010281	Don't you dare mention the NCR under this roof. They are butchers without honor, killers of women and children!
GID00010282	If you should ever tire of wandering alone, seek us out. You might just have the makings of a Great Khan yourself.
GID00010283	Whatever your motivation was, I think we owe you a debt.
GID00010284	You've helped me see Caesar for what he is, and I thank you for that - but if you suggest that again I will have your head.
GID00010285	We'll remain until the camp is packed up. If you have some plan, see to it quickly.
GID00010286	Name's Regis. I'm Papa's second-in-command. You might say I... share your concern about Caesar.
GID00010287	You want to convince Papa not to ally with Caesar, right? Trust me, you'll get nowhere just talking to him about it.
GID00010288	He's fixated on restoring the glory of the Great Khans, and he sees Caesar as the path to that restoration.
GID00010289	Because Papa listens to me. And because I actually know how to get things done around here.
GID00010290	Papa can be a stubborn man, but he's not a tyrant. He listens to his tribe, and to four voices in particular: me, Jack and Diane, and Melissa.
GID00010291	If you can convince all of us that allying with Caesar is a bad idea, you might be able to sway him.
GID00010292	I have my doubts about Caesar, yes, but I won't publicly go against Papa Khan based on nothing more than doubts.
GID00010293	I've heard rumors that tribes who aligned with Caesar in the past were torn apart and reduced to slaves - prove it, and I'll back you.
GID00010294	You'd have to talk to them - but those two have been thick as thieves since they were kids. Convince one and the other will come around.
GID00010295	Ah, Melissa. She's a bit of a dreamer. Last time she was in camp, Karl filled her head with stories of serving the Legion as a speculatore.
GID00010296	Personally, I've never seen a woman in Legionaire's armor, so I have my doubts.
GID00010297	Good. Oh, one more thing: Caesar's representative, Karl, has become fast friends with Papa. Karl's the one who has him so fixated on this alliance.
GID00010298	You'll probably have an easier time of things if you can find a way to get him out of the picture.
GID00010299	I see. Then the Great Khans will fight for the Legion should Caesar give the call. If you change your mind, let me know.
GID00010300	All right, what is it you wanted?
GID00010301	Karl talks prettily about the honor and nobility of the Great Khans, but I suspect his actual opinion is less flattering.
GID00010302	Maybe you could find something he wrote that expresses that opinion, or trick him into losing his cool in the longhouse right in front of Papa.
GID00010303	I would too, if I were you.
GID00010304	If you say so.
GID00010305	Suit yourself.
GID00010306	How are those readings looking, Calamity?
GID00010307	Stealth field is stable, and the readings are clean. Gamma wave activity is... zero? Odd, but everything looks right.
GID00010308	The stealth field is unstable and scrambling things. This reading says gamma wave activity is zero, but that can't possibly be right.
GID00010309	Gamma wave activity is... zero? That can't be right. Must be a result of the interference.
GID00010310	That's like saying Caesar and Kimball would listen to each other. Nightkin don't have a lot of trust for others, mutants included.
GID00010311	Help? No, look, I apprec... You know, what, yes, I could use the help. And you look like you can handle yourself.
GID00010312	I need to get the caravans moving again, that means clearing a path north. There's too much crawling the asphalt up the road to allow it.
GID00010313	I need to get the caravans moving again, that means clearing a path north. There's too much crawling the asphalt up the road to allow it.
GID00010314	Take care - cool your heels over in the barracks, if you want.
GID00010315	Thanks, I appreciate it. Come back here when you're done, I might accidentally "lose" some supplies to pay you with.
GID00010316	At least you asked. More than some that pass through here.
GID00010317	Very well.
GID00010318	A Legion outpost. What's it look like?
GID00010319	We crossed the river when the Profligates fled from Searchlight. From here we stage raiding parties and process captures.
GID00010320	I'm an officer of the Legion, of the rank Decanus. When we encamped, I commanded a contubernium of eight Legionaries.
GID00010321	So I command what's left. Under the wise leadership of Centurion Aurelius, of course.
GID00010322	As much as their cowardice will allow. The Profligates avoid open battle, but on good days we find one of their patrols.
GID00010323	Their landmines have caused us more trouble than their marksmanship - which is lacking.
GID00010324	Of course my child. After all that you have done for us we would love to help you in the upcoming battle.
GID00010325	After all the training in virtual reality, the young ones would relish an opportunity to put their skills to battle. We'll be there when you need us.
GID00010326	We have our ears on the radio waves. When the fighting starts you can count on our air support.
GID00010327	Quit goofing off and clear the channel. I'll be damned if the President dies on my watch because you were screwing around.
GID00010328	Man, I don't even know. It's crazy.
GID00010329	Shh. You feel that? That's the winds of change, baby, and Fantastic's riding them with his magic angel wings.
GID00010330	They saw the shit I did for the NCR, how I carried them on my back, brought fire to the heathens. I wasn't gonna help them but they begged.
GID00010331	Well, somebody begged. Couldn't say who for sure. It's all a blur, you know? Chems, man. What a trip.
GID00010332	I'm working on some top secret shit I can't even tell you about, it's so mind-blowing.
GID00010333	But here's a little taste. You know how you can only collect sunlight during the day? What if you could make it daytime all the time?
GID00010334	Crazy, right? Or is it? I'm gonna find somebody smart and ask him that question, see what he says. It'll be fucking intense.
GID00010335	Keeping watch, mostly. Trying to make sure the dangers of this plant are minimized.
GID00010336	I was out on patrol at the time so I wasn't in the camp when it happened.
GID00010337	There were a few others with me after it happened, including some of my superiors.
GID00010338	Between radiation poisoning and attacks by the Legion they all died out.
GID00010339	I don't know, unfortunately. There may be clues somewhere inside the camp, but I'm not about to run in there to find out.
GID00010340	I want you to put down the troopers that... changed. Turned into ghouls.
GID00010341	We don't get many supplies out here, but I can offer you some caps and maybe some old gear.
GID00010342	I understand.
GID00010343	The whole area is irradiated and filled with mutated creatures.
GID00010344	[FAILED] Sorry I don't have anything else to offer.
GID00010345	[SUCCEEDED]I can't offer much more aside from some extra ammo.
GID00010346	Thank you. Could you bring me their dog tags? Some of the troopers should still be wearing them.
GID00010347	I'll give you some caps for each one you bring back to me. There's an old rifle in it for you if you can bring me at least 10.
GID00010348	Oh and take these radiation supplies. You'll need them.
GID00010349	Those boys aren't themselves anymore. They're in pain, and you don't let good men suffer like that.
GID00010350	Those troopers deserve a clean death.
GID00010351	Because it's a far safer place to be than here.
GID00010352	Mostly ghouls, and a handful of radscorps. I think some geckos moved in not too long ago.
GID00010353	They seem to stick mostly to the south end of the camp.
GID00010354	If he's a ghoul he should be put down. I can't let a rabid dog suffer.
GID00010355	Sure.
GID00010356	Doesn't mean he isn't suffering, or that he won't go feral eventually.
GID00010357	Sure.
GID00010358	[FAILED] I'd rather not take the chance.
GID00010359	[SUCCEEDED] Alright, I'll give him a shot.
GID00010360	[FAILED] Sorry, I can't take that risk.
GID00010361	[SUCCEEDED] Well, maybe I can give him a chance.
GID00010362	There's a ranger station north of here that has a few ghouls running it. Maybe they'll take him in.
GID00010363	Good luck with that.
GID00010364	Sure.
GID00010365	Thank you for the help. I can rest easier knowing those poor soldiers no longer have to suffer.
GID00010366	Couldn't you tell? That damn radiation bomb got me. I can't serve the NCR like this...
GID00010367	I suppose.
GID00010368	I'm not so sure about that. I don't know how the NCR feels about ghouls.
GID00010369	Yeah, I know.
GID00010370	What?
GID00010371	Later.
GID00010372	Sorry, I'm not about to give it up. It's the only thing I have left that reminds me of who I was.
GID00010373	He wants to kill me? What did I ever do to him?
GID00010374	Sure.
GID00010375	Believe me, I'd love to leave, but I can't because I don't know what effect the radiation will have on me.
GID00010376	I'm guessing it's because I'm outside of the heavy radiation areas. I'm not going outside to find out, though.
GID00010377	Alright.
GID00010378	I don't really know the details of it, it all happened too quickly. I remember being hit by a blast of energy.
GID00010379	Next thing I know, I wake up like... like this. I've been staying in this house ever since.
GID00010380	I don't know much about what's going on outside, aside from the creatures that moved in since then.
GID00010381	Yeah, but I don't want to go feral, and that's probably what more radiation would do to me.
GID00010382	Radscorpions. Fuckers creep the hell out of me. I'm not going outside while they're still crawling around.
GID00010383	Look, just leave me alone. I'm not going outside.
GID00010384	Fine.
GID00010385	I suppose.
GID00010386	Maybe it's time for me to leave this place, then. Any ideas where I can go?
GID00010387	Nope, no way. I'm not going anywhere until I know they're gone.
GID00010388	[FAILED] Sorry, I don't believe you.
GID00010389	[SUCCEEDED] Thanks for your help. I can finally get out of this place.
GID00010390	Ok.
GID00010391	Thanks.
GID00010392	Alright.
GID00010393	You know what? Why the hell not. There are plenty of places out there to explore, and I'm kinda tired of being stuck in this house.
GID00010394	Are you sure he'll be okay with it? Not everyone is crazy about ghouls.
GID00010395	I don't know if that's such a great idea.
GID00010396	There's a Ranger Station run by ghouls? Finally, I feel like I have a place to go. Thanks for your help.
GID00010397	Alright.
GID00010398	Really? Thanks, I owe you one.
GID00010399	Any ideas where I can go?
GID00010400	Sure.
GID00010401	I think I'll take my chances with the wasteland.
GID00010402	I see. Thanks for saving us the trouble.
GID00010403	I guess this is it. Not much air left now. Minutes, maybe. And this is what I have to show for it.
GID00010404	Guess the joke's <gasps air> on me. Prolly shouldn't have killed... all those people. Prolly shoulda stayed at home... and taken care of my ma.
GID00010405	She... always used to say people who... murder and steal... die bad in the end. Said they...
GID00010406	I doubt the NCR thinks so. Heh.
GID00010407	It wasn't easy. There's a lot of initiation rituals to go through, and I've got the scars to prove it.
GID00010408	But, in the end, I was tough enough to be made a member. Proudest day of my life.
GID00010409	The President is visiting today. Ranger Grant doesn't want anyone snooping around up there that doesn't have authorization.
GID00010410	Only NCR engineers or people with explicit permission from Ranger Grant are allowed roof access.
GID00010411	If you have to ask, you're not authorized.
GID00010412	Sorry, no can do.
GID00010413	Okay, just this once. Make it quick though, I don't want to get in trouble for this.
GID00010414	Not a chance.
GID00010415	Yeah, but those are the rules.
GID00010416	Other things weren't lost, but were blocked from our collective memory. Knowledge of what we're capable of, and how things spiral out of control.
GID00010417	It's in our nature to want to forget truths that keep us awake at night.
GID00010418	And for that reason it's all the more important that the Followers walk the wastes to remind people of them.
GID00010419	By all means.
GID00010420	I would think you'd know better than I. But perhaps they kept their operation here a secret, even from members of their own order.
GID00010421	They weren't here for me to ask, but I doubt they were here for electricity.
GID00010422	When the NCR first came here, it was under Brotherhood control. They usually steer clear of one another, but something here changed their minds.
GID00010423	The Brotherhood's interest in Pre-War technology has always been in weapons. It's likely they were trying to reclaim ARCHIMEDES when the NCR arrived.
GID00010424	Damned if I know. Put up a hell of a fight, though. We had them outnumbered, I don't know, twenty to one, maybe.
GID00010425	They held out as long as they could. Lost most of their force before they retreated. Gave us a little parting gift, too.
GID00010426	They had some of the plant running, but they shut it all down. Enabled an old security system, too, to keep us away from the controls. Jerkoffs.
GID00010427	None that aren't feral ghouls. Those poor bastards - I can't imagine how they must be suffering.
GID00010428	I'd like to put them out of their misery but I don't have the heart to do it. Can you do me a favor?
GID00010429	Some Legionaries snuck into the camp and set off some kind of radiation bomb.
GID00010430	I don't know where they got it, but it was damn effective. Killed almost everyone and turned the rest into ghouls.
GID00010431	Sure, what's on your mind?
GID00010432	Head north toward Novac. Look for a big dinosaur, can't miss it.
GID00010433	Who is Private Edwards?
GID00010434	You want to hear the story of the Great Khans? It's a long one, full of honor, glory and betrayal. We have suffered, but we will regain our glory.
GID00010435	Papa is one of the best leaders the Khans have ever had. He's kept us together through all of our hardships, ever since we left California.
GID00010436	Bitter Springs changed him, though. He started to really hate the NCR after the Massacre, and sometimes I worry that's poisoned his mind.
GID00010437	You can ask, but why would I do that? Karl's told me all about life in the Legion! He says I've got all the makings of a speculatore.
GID00010438	My name is Karl. Glorious Caesar has sent me as an emissary to the Great Khans as a token of our alliance.
GID00010439	You march all the way out to Red Rock Canyon, enter my home as bold as you please, and you have no idea who I am? You've got guts, I'll give you that.
GID00010440	Well, then, let me educate you: I am the chief of the Great Khans - the Khan of Khans, if you like. This is my tribe and these are my people.
GID00010441	Name's Regis - I'm Papa Khan's advisor and right-hand man. I'm also the chief enforcer of the tribe's laws - so watch your behavior.
GID00010442	They're a tribe of fine warriors, with many proud traditions and a glorious history. They will be worthy additions to the Legion.
GID00010443	[SUCCEEDED] Join? Oh, no, I simply couldn't. That is... I'm not worthy of such an honor.
GID00010444	[FAILED] Alas, my first loyalty is to Caesar, and a soldier cannot have two masters.
GID00010445	Unh... Legion caught me. Said this... was the penalty for drug runners. Please... let me down.
GID00010446	A Legion patrol caught me trying to cross the river. When they found the, umm, package I was carrying, they strung me up there.
GID00010447	Please... for the love of God, let me down!
GID00010448	Well, not exactly. More like... trying to expand our markets. I heard there was a lot of untapped territory down south, but the Legion caught me.
GID00010449	Unnnh.
GID00010450	Thank God. Let me down, please!
GID00010451	They did? Heh. Probably mostly Jack's idea, he always was the soft touch.
GID00010452	Thanks. You've saved my life, and done the Great Khans a huge favor. I'll be heading back to Red Rock Canyon now - maybe we'll see each other there.
GID00010453	No! God, please!
GID00010454	Sure, just make them quick.
GID00010455	Okay, but keep it quick. I'd like to get out of here before the Legionnaires come to check on me.
GID00010456	Thanks. See you around.
GID00010457	Thank you, that was very helpful. I don't think I'll need those books after all.
GID00010458	Uh, never mind. Take the supplies. All yours, friend.
GID00010459	All right. I'll have him brought in for questioning.
GID00010460	Tyrone wasn't authorized to deliver any of this. There were reports of our supplies being used by the Great Khans to make illegal chems.
GID00010461	Until now, we've never had any hard evidence. Most of the chems end up with the Fiends, a group of crazies the NCR tangles with regularly.
GID00010462	We'll have to conduct a thorough investigation of all our quartermasters, and crack down on sloppy record-keeping. Thank you.
GID00010463	Other than Tyrone, were any other NCR citizens involved in this smuggling operation?
GID00010464	All right. Thanks for all your help.
GID00010465	Just a little rest stop that me and my good friend Lupe set up. Last stop on your way into New Vegas, first stop on your way out, that's what I say.
GID00010466	Uh-huh. And how exactly was he exposed?
GID00010467	I knew I shouldn't have trusted you! You're going to pay for that!
GID00010468	Well, fuck. I can't believe I'm going back to Red Rock empty-handed. Thanks for trying to help.
GID00010469	I don't think that's the whole story, but fuck it. I'm going back to Red Rock. I've had enough of this place.
GID00010470	Absolutely not! Caesar is of great use to me.
GID00010471	I don't want you harming a hair on that man's head - assuming you can find one.
GID00010472	I... really don't see the connection. Look, I'm a soldier, not a scientist. I just do my job.
GID00010473	That's... great? So there was a problem, after all. Huh. Well, I'm not a scientist, so it's not my fault if I didn't see anything wrong.
GID00010474	They're based out of the old fort in Freeside. They supposedly helped the NCR out at some point, but they go their own way now.
GID00010475	They know stuff about tech and medicine and usually help out anybody who asks. Can't say I know any more than that.
GID00010476	They're based out of the old fort in Freeside. They supposedly helped the NCR out at some point, but they go their own way now.
GID00010477	They know stuff about tech and medicine and usually help out anybody who asks. Can't say I know any more than that.
GID00010478	The Old Mormon Fort serves as the regional hub for the Followers of the Apocalypse. I am the administrator for this region.
GID00010479	The Followers of the Apocalypse aren't just interested in research. We care for our fellow man and do everything we can to help humanity.
GID00010480	Here in Freeside, we provide food and medical services for those in need. We have also organized reconstruction efforts.
GID00010481	With the help of Bill Ronte, we were able to install a water pump just west of here, but the Kings quickly took control of the pump.
GID00010482	We arose from the Boneyards of Adytum years ago. Since then, we have made it our mission to rebuild the wasteland and reeducate its inhabitants.
GID00010483	We hope to forge a brave new world free of war and poverty by sharing knowledge and resources. Our primary goal is the free exchange of ideas.
GID00010484	That's too bad. Ol' Festus was looking forward to a good tussle.
GID00010485	If this is your first rodeo with the ol' horseshoes, say "How do I play?". Otherwise, say "Lucky Horseshoes" to begin.
GID00010486	Well, it has been awhile. All right, let's do this.
GID00010487	All over the place. The easiest place to find them is unopened bottles of Sunset Sarsaparilla.
GID00010488	You'd think they'd all have been picked clean by now, but somehow new bottles keep appearing in the machines.
GID00010489	Some say it's old Festus that does it, hoping someone will finally collect enough caps to earn the treasure.
GID00010490	Other than bottles, you'll just have to scavenge. You can find caps in the unlikeliest of places, and blue-star caps are no exception.
GID00010491	Nah, I gave it up years ago. Too dangerous. And even if I did still collect them, I'd tell you the same.
GID00010492	There's people out there so mad with the idea of treasure that they'll attack strangers just on the suspicion that they have some of those caps.
GID00010493	No one knows. Money? Weapons? Water? It is, or maybe was, something of value, and that's enough to get people motivated.
GID00010494	It's said that the treasure is guarded by a man named Festus, and he's the one who asks for the blue-star caps.
GID00010495	It's also said that he's been around since the war, standing a lonely vigil, waiting for someone to come and take the treasure off his hands.
GID00010496	That'd make him pretty damn old, but I've met a few people in my travels who claimed they actually met him, and they weren't the lying type either.
GID00010497	You're right. I'm sorry. That imbecile in the next room has me on edge. I used to be more fun.
GID00010498	I'm still passionate about my work though. Otherwise I wouldn't be here.
GID00010499	I'm in the Followers of the Apocalypse. How about you?
GID00010500	Jesus. You're a real goddamn psycho.
GID00010501	I know I'm not young and pretty any more, but I appreciate the thought all the same. Here, take the parts, you flatterer.
GID00010502	Take care, now.
GID00010503	[SUCCEEDED] Eh, fair enough. It's not like anyone's ever wanted to buy them before. 250 caps it is.
GID00010504	[FAILED] Oh, I don't know about that. Lots of folks travel by on their way to New Vegas.
GID00010505	[SUCCEEDED] Ha! Yes, you are quite the smoothtalker. What the hell - 250 it is.
GID00010506	[FAILED] Oh, you're charming in your own way, I suppose. Not budging on the price for those parts, though.
GID00010507	Pleasure doing business with you.
GID00010508	Okay.
GID00010509	A pleasure doing business with you.
GID00010510	No worries. I'll hold onto those parts for you.
GID00010511	Here, Rey! Mama's got something for you.
GID00010512	[SUCCEEDED] Fair enough. Here, Rey! Mama's got something for you.
GID00010513	[FAILED] I happen to disagree. 700 caps, and that's my one and only offer.
GID00010514	All right, then.
GID00010515	He and I had joined up with the same caravan. Add in a lot of whiskey, and, well, let's just say we got to know each other.
GID00010516	Because of a promise. One I haven't been able to keep. The Nightkin all suffer from schizophrenia. It's the Stealth Boys they use, used to use.
GID00010517	Nightkin have a hard time being seen like normal folks. Can't stand it. A few already left to try and find more Stealth Boys.
GID00010518	Miserable situation. They either stay here and suffer, or dig up Stealth Boys and lose their minds. Not much of a choice.
GID00010519	That happens, there's a good chance other Nightkin will follow. It'll make it hard to get a cure to them.
GID00010520	Worse, if Keene and the Nightkin tear up the Mojave hunting for Stealth Boys, people are going get killed.
GID00010521	Most humans can't tell the difference between mutants. Might come here looking for payback.
GID00010522	I watch over the Bighorners. They're sweet, gentle creatures, but sometimes they get ornery. Just like my grandkids!
GID00010523	Outside New Vegas, at what was once called Nellis Air Force Base, resides an unusual tribe known as the Boomers.
GID00010524	They are, shall we say, aggressively reclusive? They have several howitzers they fire at anyone who dares approach the base.
GID00010525	Artillery of this sort has a range of several miles. If it's going to fire on Hoover Dam, I want it firing at my targets.
GID00010526	If not, then I want to make sure that the Boomers don't sign similar treaties to fire their guns in support of the NCR or Caesar's Legion.
GID00010527	I offer many benefits, but vacation time isn't one of them.
GID00010528	Why is good help so impossible to find?
GID00010529	Use extreme caution when approaching the base. Their firepower is... considerable.
GID00010530	Recently, one of my roaming Securitrons observed a man near the base studying the pattern of its artillery fire. Maybe he's learned something.
GID00010531	You laid the foundation for my victory, so fine - I'll permit some latitude in how you schedule your work.
GID00010532	You're welcome.
GID00010533	The Omertas are fanatically loyal to each other. Still, among any group, one can find the occasional degenerate.
GID00010534	Gomorrah's receptionist happens to be one. For years she passed on whispers of what was taking place at the casino, in exchange for payment.
GID00010535	A few months ago, she clammed up. Odds are she's scared, but I've had no way of approaching her. Start with her.
GID00010536	The print-out I've given you lists every lead I've been able to uncover. See what you can find out.
GID00010537	After all that we've accomplished?
GID00010538	Arrogance was their undoing. There might be a lesson in that. But moving on...
GID00010539	Indeed. Moving on...
GID00010540	Since 2278, I've lost five roaming Securitrons near Hidden Valley.
GID00010541	I didn't receive any clear video of the incidents, but telemetry from the units destroyed indicates they were attacked with energy weapons.
GID00010542	It's obvious that the Brotherhood has a base in Hidden Valley or thereabouts. Finding it won't be easy, but getting inside will be the real trick.
GID00010543	We're talking about a coterie of bulging-eyed fanatics who think all Pre-War technology belongs to them.
GID00010544	They'll never accept my using an army of robots to defend New Vegas. While it's a fight I can win, I'd rather sidestep it altogether.
GID00010545	Don't tell me that you've fallen for the stories of noble paladins on crusade, preserving mankind's technology in a benighted age? Dross!
GID00010546	In any case... this is an employer - employee relationship. I've given you an assignment, and the directions are clear.
GID00010547	Simple - an NCR Ranger named Grant is in charge of security arrangements for the visit. Present yourself to him, let him know you want to help.
GID00010548	Given your reputation, it's a near-certainty that he'll accept your offer.
GID00010549	Don't dally. The precise time of Kimball's visit is a closely-guarded secret, but it will happen soon.
GID00010550	There's nothing to think about. You have a job to do, so do it.
GID00010551	You have?
GID00010552	Carry on.
GID00010553	A lot of the crops grown here support the various NCR camps in the region - McCarran, Golf, and Forlorn Hope, to name a few.
GID00010554	We can't have wastelanders popping in here for a free meal, so my squad and I are assigned to keep things from going to hell.
GID00010555	Impressive, aren't they? You don't see anything like this outside of NCR territory, that's for sure.
GID00010556	We get the water - clean water - pumped in from Lake Mead. If you follow the big pipes, they'll take you all the way to the Lake.
GID00010557	The Office of Science and Industry has carefully calculated the amount of water needed for these crops. The whole thing is handled by computer.
GID00010558	Besides, most of these crops look fine to me. If the farmers can't handle the job, they shouldn't have signed up in the first place.
GID00010559	If there really is a problem, they can take it up with Lieutenant Boyd at McCarran. Farming isn't my department.
GID00010560	Corporal White is currently solving the mystery of the Great Water Shortage. Tried to convince me he had proof, even. I didn't buy any of it.
GID00010561	He went over to Westside to talk to Tom Anderson. Anderson's a Follower of the Apocalypse. Helps the people in Westside grow crops or something.
GID00010562	Haven't seen him. Serves him right if the NCR declares him AWOL.
GID00010563	He's a glory hound, always looking for a way to get promoted to Ranger. Thinks he's too good to be a regular trooper like the rest of us.
GID00010564	Yes, please do.
GID00010565	Adios.
GID00010566	Sure do. Came from The Hub on account of the Thaler Act. Farming's decent work, but the whole thing's a bum deal.
GID00010567	Something the politicians back in Shady Sands came up with. They pay us to move here and farm the land. They even protect the fields.
GID00010568	Bad soil and rationed water. It's to be expected around here, but the rationing's off. Worst part is NCR won't admit it.
GID00010569	Pretty hard to meet their crop quotas with twenty percent less water than we're supposed to be getting. Not that OSI cares about any of this.
GID00010570	They're part of the deal, the Thaler Act. We work the fields while they protect the crops and the water.
GID00010571	Lotta folks come to New Vegas and lose everything in Freeside or the Strip. They get hungry, desperate, and try to take our hard work.
GID00010572	Much as I sympathize, their theft would put me in a bad spot. I got a crop quota to meet.
GID00010573	Everything I can. Farmers out here don't have the luxury of being picky. I get by mostly on maize and tobacco.
GID00010574	Can do.
GID00010575	Westside, huh? I hope the NCR does something about those thieving bastards. I appreciate it, and so do the rest of the farmers.
GID00010576	Maybe you don't want for food much, but you can sell these on the market for a good price. Like I said, we're much obliged for the help.
GID00010577	That's what I figured. Don't know why the heck they're so stubborn they couldn't just admit it.
GID00010578	Sure you don't. All just a happy coincidence, am I right?
GID00010579	I hear the Brahmin ranchers out in Redding are looking for some hard workers, so I might try there first. I hate working with Brahmin, though.
GID00010580	Good luck to you out here.
GID00010581	I wouldn't be able to meet the quota, and the NCR would kick me out of my job, anyway. Nah, it's better I get out on my own terms.
GID00010582	Yes, he said he was looking into the water shortage, but I haven't heard back from him. Got the feeling he wasn't here in any official way.
GID00010583	White was talking to me about computer stuff and water delivery schedules through the pipes, but I'm just a farmer. Tech stuff is beyond me.
GID00010584	The last person I saw him talking to was Lieutenant Romanowski. Romanowski's around here somewhere. Sorry I couldn't be more helpful.
GID00010585	Ever since he lost his job a few years back he hasn't been the same. He took a switch to us for the tiniest things.
GID00010586	We were trying to get away when the legion showed up. I'm glad he ran off like a coward, but slavery wasn't the kind of escape I was looking for.
GID00010587	Anything you can do to help, just please get us out of here.
GID00010588	Later.
GID00010589	Just making some deliveries to the troops here in Primm. I'm stationed in California, but I come across the border a couple times a month.
GID00010590	You trying to get me busted? Keep your damn voice down - Lieutenant Hayes already has his eye on me.
GID00010591	Look, I already told Chomps that the NCR's getting suspicious of all these "misplaced" supplies. Bigger risk means bigger cost - 300 caps bigger.
GID00010592	Keep your damn voice down. Even though Lieutenant Hayes got himself killed recently, somebody else might be watching me.
GID00010593	Look, I already told Chomps that the NCR's getting suspicious of all these "misplaced" supplies. Bigger risk means bigger cost - 300 caps bigger.
GID00010594	Yeah, and as it turns out, the advance wasn't enough. The price has gone up. That's just how it goes.
GID00010595	[SUCCEEDED] I've reconsidered my position, and I think it would be in my best interest if I were to sacrifice my profit on this particular deal.
GID00010596	[FAILED] I'd love to help you and Chomps, but I got my own expenses to worry about.
GID00010597	[SUCCEEDED] Fine, I'll just eat the cost and do a favor for Chomps. Just this one time only.
GID00010598	[FAILED] Hey, that's just business.
GID00010599	Pleasure doing business with you. Of course, this whole deal never happened, am I right?
GID00010600	Whatever. You know where to find me.
GID00010601	Still got 'em. You ready to pay up?
GID00010602	It's better than farming or herding Brahmin. As long as they don't send me to the front lines, I'm a happy man.
GID00010603	I'm just the middle man. The Great Khans are a hard group, and some of them are no good, but they're not all the same.
GID00010604	I believe in the NCR, but that doesn't make it right for them to roll over anyone who doesn't want any part of 'em.
GID00010605	He's always been shady, but this is the first time he's outright screwed me.
GID00010606	Good luck.
GID00010607	She's my daughter. Takes a little too much after her mother, rest her soul, but she's happy with the Great Khans, and that's enough for me.
GID00010608	Don't leave a trail.
GID00010609	The only Khans this far into NCR territory is me and my crew, and I didn't steal squat from you.
GID00010610	Besides, even if some of my gang did steal from you, I wouldn't rat them out. Loyalty actually means something to the Great Khans.
GID00010611	As far as I know, it's just me and my crew out here, and if it really was Great Khans who mugged you, they didn't come this way. I'd have seen 'em.
GID00010612	Awaiting a delivery, but it's a no-show. I'm guessing that the Deathclaws in the quarry have something to do with that.
GID00010613	Is that right? What's your angle?
GID00010614	I know something of your reputation with my gang, and I can't be seen working with you. Sorry, but I'll handle this.
GID00010615	Supplies to make chems. The NCR's the best source since they're hard to come by anywhere else.
GID00010616	We don't really use the chems ourselves, just sell them to anybody with the caps. If it ends up hurting the NCR in the process, that's a bonus.
GID00010617	The Khans and the NCR don't get along - they prefer to shoot us on sight, even if we're not looking for a fight.
GID00010618	Right. All right, here's the deal.
GID00010619	I was expecting a shipment of chemicals. It's usually in a suitcase dropped off in one of the big machines up here.
GID00010620	Because of the Deathclaws, I have to assume that the suitcase is still in Sloan. Snoop around the place and get it for me.
GID00010621	All right, fair enough. You help us out, and I'll owe you one.
GID00010622	That's a motive I can understand.
GID00010623	I wouldn't eat or drink them, but no, they won't explode if you drop them or anything.
GID00010624	Like what?
GID00010625	Don't kill anybody if you don't have to. I'm a scout, and I like to keep a low profile.
GID00010626	You actually came through for us. I... didn't expect that. Anyway, the Great Khans pay their debts and don't forget their friends.
GID00010627	If you ever come out to Red Rock Canyon, I'll put in a good word for you.
GID00010628	We're an independent group. We take care of our own and don't take crap from anybody, especially the NCR.
GID00010629	That's a smart move. The Great Khans look out for their friends.
GID00010630	Bitter Springs happened. Women and children died when the NCR attacked the Great Khans there, and the NCR just pretends it never happened.
GID00010631	Our main camp is up in Red Rock Canyon, but we don't allow just anyone to come on in.
GID00010632	The NCR can't touch us there - too many places for us to ambush them. We see their scouts poking around once in awhile, but they keep their distance.
GID00010633	<snuffle>
GID00010634	<whuff>
GID00010635	<whuff>
GID00010636	<snuffle!>
GID00010637	[SUCCEEDED] <snuffle!>
GID00010638	[FAILED] <whuff!>
GID00010639	This battle is far from over. Once the reinforcements from McCarran arrive, the counteroffensive will begin.
GID00010640	They're a bunch of escaped cons from down south. The NCR was using them to maintain the railways as part of their sentence.
GID00010641	I don't know who screwed up, but the Powder Gangers are loose. It was one group that attacked us and took our entire supply of dynamite.
GID00010642	We'd see them occasionally, but they didn't seem too keen on getting too close to the quarry. Not sure if it was the noise or all the workers.
GID00010643	I can't believe that an entire pack moved into the quarry. I thought that kind of bad luck only happened in New Vegas.
GID00010644	Have you even seen a Deathclaw? They're taller than a man and far, far stronger and faster. And, there's a whole pack of them out there.
GID00010645	You'd have to be the meanest, toughest, roughest bastard in the wasteland to have any chance against them, and I don't think that's you.
GID00010646	You'd need to take out the pack leaders - the Mother Deathclaw and the Deathclaw Alpha Male. Kill 'em, and the pack will scatter. Pretty tough job.
GID00010647	I don't what it is about you, but I think you could actually pull it off. Deathclaws are tough bastards, but you might be even tougher.
GID00010648	Nobody here's any use to you in a fight against Deathclaws, but take these medical supplies. You'll probably need them.
GID00010649	To do the job right, you've got to get rid of the pack leaders - the Mother Deathclaw and the Deathclaw Alpha Male. Should run the rest of 'em off.
GID00010650	Okay.
GID00010651	It all gets shipped by rail over towards Boulder City and Hoover Dam. The NCR's probably building fortifications with it all.
GID00010652	It's a big machine which moves rocks around, piles at a time. It's Pre-War tech, so you need to thump it once in awhile to keep it running.
GID00010653	Nope. The NCR's been trying to switch over to using paper money, like in the Pre-War days. Trouble is that the exchange rates ain't exactly fair.
GID00010654	For example, a hundred bucks in NCR money is valued at roughly half that in caps around here. Seems like a rotten deal for us, but work is work.
GID00010655	Sure.
GID00010656	Yeah, he - or she, I guess - wandered into camp a couple of months back. Seemed friendly enough.
GID00010657	Ugly-looking thing, but the guys like having it around. Good for morale and all that.
GID00010658	Uh... hmm... well, no accounting for taste I guess. Anyway...
GID00010659	I've got this recipe for a Deathclaw Omelet that I've been itching to try out. Trouble is - I need a Deathclaw egg. Kinda obvious, I suppose.
GID00010660	I've got this recipe for a Deathclaw Omelet that I've been itching to try out. Trouble is - I need a Deathclaw egg. Kinda obvious, I suppose.
GID00010661	You're just pulling my leg, right? Why would anyone... uh... never mind. Anyway...
GID00010662	I've got this recipe for a Deathclaw Omelet that I've been itching to try out. Trouble is - I need a Deathclaw egg. Kinda obvious, I suppose.
GID00010663	Ha. Yeah, can you believe some people still eat that stuff? Anyway...
GID00010664	My great-aunt Rose ran a bed and breakfast back in California, in a town called Modoc. She's the one who created the recipe in the first place.
GID00010665	I don't know how she managed to get a hold of a female Deathclaw, but she kept it in a shed. Aunt Rose had a steady supply of eggs for her omelets.
GID00010666	At least, she did until some stranger came along and killed the Deathclaw. Shot it right in the eye.
GID00010667	The quarry just north of here is full of Deathclaws, so there's bound to be an egg or two in there somewhere.
GID00010668	Of course, a Deathclaw egg from anywhere will do. According to my Aunt Rose, those things have a ridiculously long shelf life.
GID00010669	I don't have much in the way of money, but I'd be willing to share the secret of the recipe.
GID00010670	All right. Do you need anything to eat or drink?
GID00010671	All right, then!
GID00010672	Yeah?
GID00010673	Sure. What did you want to know?
GID00010674	Sure thing.
GID00010675	Oh, I'm not. I'm making my way to New Vegas. They say anything goes there, and best of all, the NCR can't mess it up for you.
GID00010676	I'll get there eventually. I've heard that you can't even get into the Strip unless you're rich.
GID00010677	Born and raised. Things back in California are better than they've ever been, according to my grandpa.
GID00010678	The Raiders are mostly gone now and it's easy enough to get a job at one of the mills or farms. But now there's taxes and laws and other things.
GID00010679	The NCR keeps things safe and orderly, but it's all very boring. So, I came out east towards the frontier.
GID00010680	Well, there's the Deathclaws, of course, and there was that one group of Powder Gangers who stole all the dynamite.
GID00010681	I think we're too small and poor for anyone to bother with, really. I keep a weapon near my bunk, though - same as everybody here.
GID00010682	I can't believe you actually got one. Give me a bit to get the recipe set up, then talk to me again.
GID00010683	Stay safe. The road's dangerous in these parts. Or so I hear.
GID00010684	What? This? He stole this from me at gunpoint. Lucky for me, he got distracted and I got a chance to draw on him.
GID00010685	It's a, uh, necklace that I made out of these special caps. You ever see any caps with a blue star on them like these?
GID00010686	Ah, then you know how rare they are. I'm just glad they're back where they belong. You can never be too careful these days.
GID00010687	Well, it was nice to meet you. I'm going to take a few moments to get myself together, then head out.
GID00010688	That's too bad. They're very rare. Well, I should be going. Nice talking to you.
GID00010689	You know, I was just thinking the same thing about you.
GID00010690	They are nice, aren't they? I'm very proud of them.
GID00010691	Pretty sure, yeah. it's really nice, isn't it? Have you ever seen caps with pretty blue stars on them like these?
GID00010692	Well, I guess you're just too smart for me. Unfortunately, I can't leave any witnesses behind.
GID00010693	So what if I did? What are you going to do about it?
GID00010694	H-here. You can have the damn necklace. Just leave me alone!
GID00010695	You are such a wimp! Die!
GID00010696	Not if I kill you first!
GID00010697	Fat chance of that. What are you going to do if don't?
GID00010698	Uh, sure. I'll just be going then.
GID00010699	It started off innocently enough. I was traveling, as I often do, and happened to observe you picking up one of those blue-star caps.
GID00010700	You didn't show any reaction to it, so I figured you didn't know what you'd gotten your hands on.
GID00010701	Okay, you're a dangerous sort. I get that. But I have some information I think you'll find useful, which made me follow you for a spell.
GID00010702	There's an old wasteland legend that says somewhere out there is a fabulous treasure from before the war.
GID00010703	Those caps with the blue star on them, the tale goes, are the key to that treasure. They're called Sunset Sarsaparilla Stars.
GID00010704	I had to make sure of your disposition. There's a lot of jumpy folks out there that'd shoot a man as soon as talk to him.
GID00010705	Now that's we're conversing, though, I can tell you what I know about those caps.
GID00010706	Fine. Just do me a favor. If you find more of those things, and plan on keeping them, watch out for a man named Allen Marks.
GID00010707	He's killed more than a few people to collect as many of those caps as he can, and your ignorance as to what they are won't protect you.
GID00010708	Not for long. I met her on the road a few days ago, and we've been traveling together since.
GID00010709	Yeah, every once in a while you can find a cap with a blue star on it. They're pretty rare, so I started collecting them.
GID00010710	Once I had enough, I made a necklace out of them, since I thought they were lucky.
GID00010711	And maybe they are, since you managed to show up at just the right time.
GID00010712	Yeah, every once in a while you can find a cap with a blue star on it. They're pretty rare, so I started collecting them.
GID00010713	Once I had enough, I made a necklace out of them, since I thought they were lucky.
GID00010714	[SUCCEEDED] Really? I had no idea. And here I've been carrying them all this time, never knowing how dangerous they were.
GID00010715	What do you think I should do with them? Bury 'em or something?
GID00010716	[FAILED] Even if what you're saying is true, I think I'll take my chances. This necklace and I have been through a lot, and we're both still kicking.
GID00010717	If that's not lucky, what is?
GID00010718	What? The hell I will!
GID00010719	Uh, yeah, sure. H-here you go. Just don't hurt me.
GID00010720	They're all yours. I sincerely hope they work better for you than they did for me.
GID00010721	You got it. I'm glad I ran into you. Thanks for the advice.
GID00010722	I will. That's the last time I pick up a straggler on the road, believe me.
GID00010723	Prepared already. I like it. There's no need to give me the details, it's probably best that way.
GID00010724	Even though you already have a plan, I may have some information that you might find useful.
GID00010725	You better start thinking about it soon, we're on a limited time schedule.
GID00010726	I do have some information that could help you.
GID00010727	True, but I don't think it'll be that easy.
GID00010728	Going in guns blazing with all the NCR Troopers and Rangers stationed at the dam will just get you killed.
GID00010729	I do have some information that you might find useful, if you're interested.
GID00010730	Fine, be like that. I'm just here to give you whatever information I can to help you get the job done.
GID00010731	If you don't need my help, that's fine with me.
GID00010732	I've been spying in the dam for a while now. I've gathered quite a bit of information from various sources.
GID00010733	You're the boss.
GID00010734	I'll be in the crowd. Do whatever you need to do, then find me before Kimball arrives.
GID00010735	Here's your disguise. This'll get you past most of the NCR there, but watch out for the rangers. Odds are this won't fool them.
GID00010736	I'll meet you there. Good luck.
GID00010737	Suggestions, eh? I'd suggest you play to your strengths. There's probably plenty of ways to kill Kimball, just find one that works best for you.
GID00010738	We'll have a few hours before he arrives. You should look around and see if you can find anything that you can use.
GID00010739	Just be careful. You don't want to cause a scene before Kimball even shows up.
GID00010740	I've been able to get some basic information on the schedule for Kimball's visit as well as getting some rough security details.
GID00010741	I have some disguises for us. I've already got mine. A wealthy Brahmin Baron who bribed his way into seeing the President.
GID00010742	As for you, I have a NCR trooper uniform that I acquired. It'll fool most of the troopers and civilians, but it probably won't fool the rangers.
GID00010743	Well, I have a bomb here that can be put on the vertibird that will detonate at a certain altitude, but it's a little unstable and dangerous.
GID00010744	If there's nothing else, then we should get moving.
GID00010745	The President is scheduled to arrive sometime in the afternoon. It's going to be a short visit to boost morale for the NCR troops.
GID00010746	He's going to arrive, give a speech, and then leave. No meet and greet, no questions, just a quick in and out.
GID00010747	They're probably afraid something is going to happen. For good reason.
GID00010748	I wasn't able to find a final itinerary for his visit, but if you can find one, you can get more details on what's going to happen.
GID00010749	Security is going to be tight. Rangers are stationed all around the observation deck where Kimball is going to give his speech.
GID00010750	Security is led by a Ranger Grant. He's a pretty rough guy who's seen a lot of combat. It's best if you steer clear of him.
GID00010751	The crowd consists of troopers and a few select civilians who were lucky enough to bribe their way in. They shouldn't cause much trouble for you.
GID00010752	Finally, there's the additional security that Kimball will be bringing with him. I wasn't able to find out much on that.
GID00010753	If I had more time in their computers I could've accessed the full duty roster and guard deployment. Maybe you'll have better luck.
GID00010754	Okay, what would you like to know?
GID00010755	Here you go. Put it to good use.
GID00010756	Harder than you think. I don't want you blowing us both up, so I'll just hold on to this.
GID00010757	Suit yourself. What else do you want to know?
GID00010758	Here you go. Put it to good use.
GID00010759	Harder than you think. I don't want you blowing this, so I'll just hold on to this.
GID00010760	Suit yourself.
GID00010761	Have you seen my helmet? I can't seem to find it.
GID00010762	It's always in the last place you look. I wonder why that is.
GID00010763	Thanks mister, you're the greatest.
GID00010764	It's always in the last place you look. I wonder why that is.
GID00010765	There it is! Thanks lady, you're the greatest.
GID00010766	He's coming to give a big fancy speech to all of us troops stationed here at the dam.
GID00010767	I'm pretty excited. He seems like such a nice guy and I get to meet him.
GID00010768	He's giving me a medal. I don't know why though. I'm just doing my job like all the other guys. I'm still excited though.
GID00010769	I can't believe someone killed President Kimball. He was such a nice guy, why would anyone want to hurt him?
GID00010770	I can't believe someone wanted to kill President Kimball. I'm glad he got out of here safe.
GID00010771	Momma always told me not to talk to strangers, but you seem like a nice person.
GID00010772	Momma left me on a farm when she went out prospecting, but when she never came back, the owner didn't want me around and kicked me out on my own.
GID00010773	A nice guy came up and asked me if I wanted to join the NCR so I did. Now the Troopers are my family. I like it here. Everyone is so nice.
GID00010774	That's too bad. I need it for the ceremony. I need to look my best and I need my lucky helmet.
GID00010775	I'll just have to keep looking. Thanks anyway.
GID00010776	Ha ha, you big joker you. You're funny. I like you.
GID00010777	I really need to find my helmet though. Thanks anyway.
GID00010778	So, you must be the Courier the reports mentioned. Pass this message on to your commander - Hoover Dam will not fall while I still draw breath.
GID00010779	What's it look like, man? I'm fucking king of the NCR. Caesar's Legion has Caesar, the NCR's got Fantastic. It's Fantastic's NCR now.
GID00010780	This whole war's about power, man. Caesar wants it. NCR wants it. Fantastic's got it.
GID00010781	After I fixed HELIOS One and basically saved the NCR from the dumbshits who run it, I got myself a little promotion. Now I run the whole shebang.
GID00010782	Whoa, hey. All right, man. It's cool. Who said anything about being your master?
GID00010783	I'm just the guy who tells you to do the stuff you do before you do it.
GID00010784	Man, what aren't my responsibilities? Dam overflow, dam underflow. Dam leakage. Sometimes the dam gets too big and I have to shrink it down.
GID00010785	People come to me to resolve their disputes with my wisdom.
GID00010786	Like, hey Fantastic, who gets to keep this doodad we found? Or, yo, Fantastic, when will you accept that you're the father of my child? It's crazy.
GID00010787	They sure as shit did. I mean there's still formalities, like I have to run everything by Lawson before I do it.
GID00010788	But do I ever do that? Is his name Fantastic?
GID00010789	No, man. That's just what I'm supposed to do.
GID00010790	But when he tells me to push the middle button to divert the intake, and the right button feels nicer when I touch it, I know where my loyalty is.
GID00010791	Man, I just don't know how an idiot like that gets put in charge of anything.
GID00010792	I should think so, but it would be up to Marjorie.
GID00010793	I have, however, told her how instrumental you were in revolutionizing our cuisine. And she knows what we stand to gain from a ruler who supports it.
GID00010794	Have a word with her, see what she says. I daresay she'll be more receptive with these new developments.
GID00010795	Better get back to it then, I don't want those poor soldiers suffering for longer than they have to.
GID00010796	The rangers at Echo have been keeping an eye on that place. It's relatively new, but those bastards have already dug in.
GID00010797	They appear to be running a slave-trading operation and it also seems to be one of the primary crossing points for Legion raiding parties.
GID00010798	Let's hear it.
GID00010799	Let's hear it.
GID00010800	No, I'm not. Not yet anyway. I'm Private Kyle Edwards, former NCR trooper.
GID00010801	I'm here because I have nowhere else to go.
GID00010802	Are you sure about that?
GID00010803	Yeah, I am. What of it?
GID00010804	Not much, I'm afraid. What do you want to know?
GID00010805	Name's Logan. What the hell do you want?
GID00010806	That's none of your damn business.
GID00010807	Tell you what. Bring us those suits, and you can come with us while we loot the town. You can keep a share.
GID00010808	It's about damn time. You ready to go?
GID00010809	Anything branded by the NCR related to weapons, computers, or radios.
GID00010810	There's gotta be more than that, keep looking.
GID00010811	Alright, we can move on now. Here's the key to the Fire Station.
GID00010812	Same stuff. Any NCR weapons, computer parts, or radio parts.
GID00010813	I'll need more than that. Keep looking.
GID00010814	Alright, thanks for the help. Time to die loser.
GID00010815	You have been a useful associate, that I'll grant you. Okay, he's yours for a discount. Just make sure the stage is downwind of the audience.
GID00010816	Well, well. Congratulations on getting the Mark II prototype functional, doctor. Now just hand it over and we'll be on our way.
GID00010817	It is different! Right now I'm trying very hard to remain civil, and you're not making it easy with your incessant questions!
GID00010818	Bah! Humans.
GID00010819	Bye.
GID00010820	Oooh, those Nightstalkers, always killing my Bighorners! It'll be nice to give them a piece of my mind!
GID00010821	Oh no, dearie, three makes a crowd.
GID00010822	I've compared the brain chemistry of a Nightkin to one of the local Nightstalkers we killed. They both exhibit similar neurochemical changes.
GID00010823	Now, I'm not claiming that Nightstalkers are running around wearing Stealth Boys, mind you. I just don't think it's all a coincidence.
GID00010824	Very well. Please stand back - I don't want any erroneous readings. You're welcome to stay and observe if you want, though.
GID00010825	Wait, Lily's not in position yet. Talk to me again once she's settled in.
GID00010826	Oh, all right.
GID00010827	Maybe you're right... but what will they think? How can I look them in the face ever again?
GID00010828	Well, I guess I don't deserve any better, huh? So be it...
GID00010829	You're right, there's no place for me here. Just... just tell them I'm sorry, and that they won't have to worry about me, ever again.
GID00010830	[SUCCEEDED]... It's all me, isn't it? The pain, the anger, my joy, all of that's just me.
GID00010831	I should've met you before, stranger. Thank you.
GID00010832	[FAILED] Some choice. I can't stay here now, and I don't have the means to leave.
GID00010833	Father... what's he going to do to me? I can't stay here, I can't hide from this!
GID00010834	Are you out of your mind? I just... no, no, no!
GID00010835	I don't want to get out, do you hear me! I just... no, no, no!
GID00010836	You think I really care about the money? I just... no, no, no!
GID00010837	So you're the bigshot that Caesar put in charge of this mission. I've heard about you. You've got quite the reputation already.
GID00010838	Well let's get down to business. Once we get started, we're going to be on a tight schedule. Are you ready to do this?
GID00010839	So you're the bigshot that Caesar put in charge of this mission. Can't say I'm impressed, but let's just get down to business.
GID00010840	Once we get started, we're going to be on a tight schedule. Are you ready to do this?
GID00010841	Right, straight to business. Good. No wonder Caesar sent you.
GID00010842	Once we get started, we're going to be on a tight schedule. Are you ready to do this?
GID00010843	Good. Kimball is scheduled to give his speech tomorrow. We'll rest here tonight and talk the plan over first thing in the morning.
GID00010844	Get some sleep. You got a big day ahead of you.
GID00010845	Good. Now Kimball is scheduled to give his speech tomorrow. We'll rest here tonight and talk over the plan first thing in the morning.
GID00010846	Get some sleep. You got a big day ahead of you.
GID00010847	Well hurry it up and get your shit together.
GID00010848	All right, power on the Stealth Boy, Lily.
GID00010849	Interesting. Try thinking aggressive thoughts now. Think about smashing a Radscorpion.
GID00010850	All right, we're done here. Go ahead and power the Stealth Boy down, Lily.
GID00010851	Turning it on. Urgh... feels strange. Strange but good.
GID00010852	Grrr! Lily smash! Haha.
GID00010853	Awww... I liked having it on.
GID00010854	I'll get back to you on that in a moment. Once I've analyzed the results - uh, oh.
GID00010855	Was a resort Pre-War. I renamed it to Jacobstown after an old friend. Died a long time ago.
GID00010856	I figured us mutants needed a place to call our own. Town's far enough away from humans so they don't bother us much.
GID00010857	One of these days I'm hoping we can trade with the rest of the wasteland. No more fighting, just... get along.
GID00010858	Was part of Super Mutant army, ran a town, walked the wasteland with a tribal. Now I'm here.
GID00010859	Long story, so here's the short version. The Master created the Super Mutants and Nightkin.
GID00010860	The Master thought he could unify everyone. No more differences, no more war. Didn't end well.
GID00010861	Town was Broken Hills. Bunch of Super Mutants, humans, and Ghouls all living together peacefully. Well, most of the time.
GID00010862	We were looking for a GECK to save the village of Arroyo. Eventually, we did. Nuked an oil rig in the process.
GID00010863	We went separate ways after that. I went east into the Rockies, looking for other mutants like myself.
GID00010864	Don't know what happened to my friend. I've got a feeling it turned out all right in the end.
GID00010865	All right.
GID00010866	Bighorners. Good eating. And we can trade the hides. Got a lot of wild ones around here, so it's easy to restock the herd.
GID00010867	You must be the backup I've been calling for. Where are the rest of your men?
GID00010868	Thank God. I hoped someone would come eventually, but where are the rest of your men?
GID00010869	Shit. Have you any damn idea what lives in these caves!? We need to get out of...
GID00010870	We need to go now!
GID00010871	I don't know. Some kind of man-fish freak like the one I killed over there.
GID00010872	I'd heard fishermen spin old tales of 'Lakelurks' swimming in the water, but I always thought they were just bullshit mermaid stories.
GID00010873	I managed to kill that thing, but not before it mangled my leg all up. No way I'm walking out of here like this.
GID00010874	I've been keeping quiet and hoping they don't realize one of their buddies is missing. We need to get out of here before they come back.
GID00010875	With my bare hands. I would have shot it, but I was cleaning my gun when they swarmed the camp.
GID00010876	The ugly bastard knocked me down and started dragging me down into these caves. I managed to get my knife out and get a good throw into it's back.
GID00010877	Once he was on the ground, all it took was a bit of choking and punching to finish him off.
GID00010878	[SUCCEEDED] Thanks a lot, doc. I think I should be able to walk out of here, now.
GID00010879	I don't want to risk running into a pack of those freaks alone, though. Could you escort me out of here?
GID00010880	[FAILED] Whoa there, buddy. What you're suggesting is downright archaic.
GID00010881	I think my tourniquet will work for now, but I still can't walk like this.
GID00010882	If I had a doctor's bag, I could probaly fix it up myself.
GID00010883	Thanks a lot, doc. Looks like I should be able to at least walk out of here, now.
GID00010884	I don't want to risk running into a pack of those freaks alone, though. Could you escort me out of here?
GID00010885	Great, just leave me here, then.
GID00010886	You can have it if you get me out of here alive. I won't have a use for it when I get back to California.
GID00010887	Great, I'll start heading back to California now. I'm not about to let myself get killed by future NCR incompetence.
GID00010888	If you find my friends, please return their dogtags to the NCR. People need to know what happened here.
GID00010889	If they won't listen, do what you can to make them listen. The dead need to be avenged.
GID00010890	Are you crazy? No way in hell am I going deeper into these caves.
GID00010891	You haven't seen what they did to the other troopers, and I'd rather not find out why they took all of the bodies.
GID00010892	[SUCCEEDED] All right, you have a point. They were good men and deserved better.
GID00010893	I can't guarantee I'll be much help against their numbers, but I'll do what I can. Chances are we won't get out of here alive anyway.
GID00010894	[FAILED] Hey, I'm all for being a hero when the time is right, but there are at least 12 of those bastards lurking around in here.
GID00010895	I'd rather not join my buddies any time soon.
GID00010896	Lead on.
GID00010897	All right, let's see here... neural pathways look good... definitely a breed of guard dog.
GID00010898	If I transplant this brain into Rex, he'll be a bit more ferocious in his attacks.
GID00010899	Have a seat. This will take awhile.
GID00010900	Let's take a look... exceptional synapse responses... descended from some type of cattle dog, I imagine.
GID00010901	If you want me to transplant this brain into Rex, he'll become more durable.
GID00010902	Have a seat. This will take awhile.
GID00010903	All right. Your call.
GID00010904	Big brain on this one. All right, let's see... damn, heavy amounts of the chemicals used in the drug Turbo are present.
GID00010905	Transplanting this brain will make Rex faster than he was before.
GID00010906	Have a seat. This will take awhile.
GID00010907	Which companion?
GID00010908	What do you want to do with Rex?
GID00010909	Very well.
GID00010910	Done.
GID00010911	What else?
GID00010912	Done. Setting VMS24 to stage 10.
GID00010913	Oh yeah? Fuck off, asshole.
GID00010914	You better make it worthwhile. I ain't going to risk my neck in The Wasteland for shit.
GID00010915	[FAILED] Like I give a shit. Didn't I say get lost, or are you looking for a beating?
GID00010916	[SUCCEEDED] I don't... wait. You've got a point.
GID00010917	All right, fellas. Let's get out of this shit hole.
GID00010918	What? Hey, guys! Help me here!
GID00010919	Shit, you're crazy!
GID00010920	That'll do, yeah.
GID00010921	All right, fellas. Let's get out of this shit hole.
GID00010922	[SUCCEEDED] Heh. More than I could make in a week of shaking down these assholes anyways.
GID00010923	All right, fellas. Let's get out of this shit hole.
GID00010924	[FAILED] You're shitting me. You got a real offer, or are you just going to waste my time?
GID00010925	Then what the hell do you want? Don't try anything, I mean it!
GID00010926	It's payback time, that's what! They've got no right to screw me over, and I'm tired of it!
GID00010927	You too? Think I'm just a little girl? I'll show you!
GID00010928	Dammit, I can take care of this by myself! That bitch is going to pay for all these years of bossing me around.
GID00010929	[SUCCEEDED] Okay, but this better not be a trick!
GID00010930	[FAILED] I'm not stupid little girl anymore, you can't talk me out of this!
GID00010931	Wh-What are you talking about? Andy wants to help me leave this hole... doesn't he?
GID00010932	She's guarding it, I know she is!
GID00010933	She's locked the bedroom door - like that's going to stop me. I was... I've got a gun, I'm going to make her give it to me!
GID00010934	She's guarding it, I know she is!
GID00010935	She's locked the bedroom door - like that's going to stop me. I was... I've got a gun, I'm going to make her give it to me!
GID00010936	... That- that- that son of a bitch! I'll take the money and I'll kill him too!
GID00010937	[SUCCEEDED] I... I don't know what I want. But I hate this place, and I hate these people.
GID00010938	It all used to be so simple. Why did they change? Why can't they see my pain?
GID00010939	[SUCCEEDED] I... I don't know what I want. But I hate this place, and I hate these people.
GID00010940	It all used to be so simple. Why did they change? Why can't they see my pain?
GID00010941	[FAILED] The money, yes! It's mine, and nobody can stop me from getting it!
GID00010942	Do they? Look at my Mother, all she cares for is a patch of bare dirt where nothing green will ever grow to feed us.
GID00010943	My Father? A trading business that he'll never own, risking his neck every day against Wastelanders and cut-throat "merchants."
GID00010944	And I'm supposed to be part of those dreams? What about my dreams, stranger? What about me?
GID00010945	Yeah, okay... I'll shoot the lock off the door and... and then.... Argh, dammit!
GID00010946	... I can't do it, I can't. She deserves it, and worse, but I can't hurt my own mother!
GID00010947	Oh, you think I won't do it? I'll show you!
GID00010948	Fine. Take it. But what the hell am I supposed to do now?
GID00010949	Oh, you think I won't do it? You think I'm not right in wanting back my life!? I'll show you!
GID00010950	Wait right there. You told my men that Alice's mother was waiting for me outside, didn't you?
GID00010951	Wait right there. I don't recall seeing your pretty face before - what do you want?
GID00010952	Nobody threatens me and walks away alive!
GID00010953	[SUCCEEDED] Hmmm... I've got my eye on you. Get the fuck off my turf.
GID00010954	[FAILED] Please, I've seen kids who were better liars than you. Tell the truth now - what are you after?
GID00010955	You think I give a shit? Has it crossed your mind that Alice is all the way in this with me?
GID00010956	Maybe because I'm so good-looking.
GID00010957	Maybe because her mother's trying to break her back planting crops that die from rads as soon as they're in the ground.
GID00010958	Or maybe she's just a dupe. Why do you even care? She's happy making her own way in the world.
GID00010959	Oh boy, you've just made your last mistake.
GID00010960	Leaving so soon? And I thought we'd have time for a little chat.
GID00010961	And... you think that's worth her happiness? Go on and tell her, then. Watch what happens when you crush her dreams.
GID00010962	Family's just what the world throws on our shoulders without our say or opinion.
GID00010963	You think Alice cares about her family? Tell her, then. Family's what drove her to me in the first place.
GID00010964	It's not polite to leave in the middle of a conversation, but I won't try to teach you manners. This time.
GID00010965	And how exactly would you do that?
GID00010966	Yeah, sure.
GID00010967	I'm glad we understand each other. Alice's at her home, getting our means out of this shit-hole. Make sure things go smoothly.
GID00010968	That's right, and good riddance.
GID00010969	I'll see you around.
GID00010970	'Cause that's the law of the land. You never know when someone's going to stab you in the back... and I like mine upright.
GID00010971	Maybe one day, stranger, when you've seen all I've seen, done all I've done, you'll sooner trust a Radscorpion than a new face in The Wasteland.
GID00010972	And I only asked first... I'll try one last time before I find out the hard way. Where you come from, and where you going?
GID00010973	All right... keep walking.
GID00010974	I'll see you again, stranger.
GID00010975	So long, warrior.
GID00010976	You ain't too smart, are you? Okay, let's dance.
GID00010977	[FAILED] I sure am, stranger. But there ain't anything about you that makes me want to go into details.
GID00010978	[SUCCEEDED] You've got a sharp eye on you. I take it you like guns, huh? Question is, can you handle more than just a weapon...
GID00010979	Sure thing. What's on your noggin?
GID00010980	What's eating you?
GID00010981	We're independent folks here. Merchants, gamblers, NCR whores, all of them trade with us and we offer protection against critters and the Fiends.
GID00010982	That's a long one, stranger. Let's just say I got tired of killing in The Wasteland and now I've found a better home for my old butt.
GID00010983	Alice... Oh yeah. I've seen her 'round here much too often as of late. I reckon she's been hanging out with Andy and his crew.
GID00010984	You heard me. We don't like those stiff-back, clean-hand, little pussies. New Vegas belongs to the people.
GID00010985	The NCR's just a corrupt and bloated monster, no better than any other Wasteland crawler. We make this land wealthy, and we ain't giving it up.
GID00010986	The NCR's just a corrupt and bloated monster, no better than any other Wasteland crawler. We make this land wealthy, and we ain't giving it up.
GID00010987	They're a bunch of lunatics, so pumped full of chems that they don't give a damn about life anymore. Fiends rape, kill and maim for the hell of it.
GID00010988	Vault 3's Fiend territory. Those shit-heads attack Westside all the time, even making it to the rest of Outer Vegas when they crawl under the sewers.
GID00010989	Vault 3's Fiend territory. Those shit-heads attack Westside all the time, even making it to the rest of Outer Vegas when they crawl under the sewers.
GID00010990	Bad weeds don't die easy. Still, things will be safer now that you've taught a lesson to those crazies.
GID00010991	Try "The Gray." Beats me why people go into that forsaken thing. At least with huts and sewers you know they ain't crumbling on top of your head.
GID00010992	Outer Vegas ain't exactly a safe place. Despite our numbers, The Wasteland creeps through every nook and cranny.
GID00010993	I make sure any dangers to the people of North Vegas stay outside our barriers, stranger. Day and night, I stand watch.
GID00010994	I make sure any dangers to the people of North Vegas stay outside our barriers, stranger. Day and night, I stand watch.
GID00010995	I know she's been frequenting the square in North Vegas, probably hanging out with street scum. I want to know more about her new "friends."
GID00010996	I know she's been frequenting the square in North Vegas, probably hanging out with street scum. I want to know more about her new "friends."
GID00010997	Folks call this East Vegas, but I don't care much for names.
GID00010998	The east side gets lots of merchant and gambler traffic. We're safer here than in North Vegas or Westside, though we've got to put up with the NCR.
GID00010999	The east side gets lots of merchant and gambler traffic. We're safer here than in North Vegas or Westside, though we've got to put up with the NCR.
GID00011000	Don't get me started, stranger. We don't take kindly to either of them. We've fought hard for our home, and we're here to stay.
GID00011001	The Legion knows nothing of working the land. Those folks would rather pillage, burn and steal, like mad beasts. That ain't honest living.
GID00011002	The NCR's no better. They won't burn your home and rape your daughter, sure, but they'll steal your wealth all the same... when you ain't looking.
GID00011003	The Legion knows nothing of working the land. Those folks would rather pillage, burn and steal, like mad beasts. That ain't honest living.
GID00011004	The NCR's no better. They won't burn your home and rape your daughter, sure, but they'll steal your wealth all the same... when you ain't looking.
GID00011005	He did, huh? All right, what do you want?
GID00011006	He should really mind his own business. Crandon's good to keep scum in check, but he ain't exactly subtle.
GID00011007	If you're good at snooping around, then I could use you. I need to find out what my daughter's up to.
GID00011008	She's been frequenting the square in North Vegas, probably hanging out with street scum. I want to know more about her new "friends."
GID00011009	Whatever you say, stranger. Go snoop somewhere else and get the fuck out of my house, right now!
GID00011010	Are you deaf? I don't give a damn about what you want. Just get out of here.
GID00011011	Get lost!
GID00011012	Goodbye, stranger.
GID00011013	You think I'm going to be easy, huh? Come get some, asshole!
GID00011014	Okay, what's on your mind?
GID00011015	All right, we've got a deal then. I'll make sure to compensate you for your time, if you find anything useful.
GID00011016	This ain't "babysitting," stranger. I'm telling you, these people are nasty and Alice is in danger.
GID00011017	Oh yeah? What for?
GID00011018	Maybe they don't wanna talk to you. Maybe they ain't here anymore. Maybe you ask too many questions, stranger.
GID00011019	This is our turf. Don't even try to snoop around or I'll fucking kill your right here, right now.
GID00011020	This is our turf. Don't even try to snoop around or I'll fucking kill your right here, right now.
GID00011021	So what? I don't give a shit about what you like. Go cry to your mama.
GID00011022	Get lost!
GID00011023	Maybe they don't wanna talk to you. Maybe they ain't here anymore. Maybe you ask too many questions, stranger.
GID00011024	This is our turf. Don't even try to snoop around or I'll fucking kill your right here, right now.
GID00011025	What? You've got to be kidding me... Fuck, why do I always gotta fix someone else's crap around here?
GID00011026	I'm ready for you... Hey, guys, need a hand here!
GID00011027	I mean you've first got to know yourself before you can truly know the gun.
GID00011028	So, let's see it, stranger. Do you know yourself?
GID00011029	So, let's see it, stranger. Do you know yourself?
GID00011030	[SUCCEEDED] We see eye to eye, we speak warrior to warrior... And I thought myself too old to find an equal, Ha!
GID00011031	Listen, warrior. There're two kinds of folks. You load your gun like an ordinary man, or you load it like a devil.
GID00011032	We ain't ordinary, are we? See, I pack good brass up with slow-burning powder, then cap it with a heavy semiwadcutter bullet.
GID00011033	That's how you make .44 ammo that'll put the fear of the heavens on any waster that dare cross your path.
GID00011034	[FAILED] You don't get it yet, stranger. I'm not surprised, though. It takes a special type. Come back when you've got what it takes.
GID00011035	Alpha Squad reporting in. Thanks for the support back there. We've been assigned to ensure you make it to the Legate. How can we be of assistance?
GID00011036	If you want. It's not really my thing. What do you want to know?
GID00011037	Give me my rifle and a clear line of sight and I'll start picking them off before they've even seen me.
GID00011038	Didn't have much hand-to-hand training, so our chances are better if you keep the enemy out of my face.
GID00011039	I'm trained as a spotter, too. If you're looking through a scope, I can find your targets for you.
GID00011040	No.
GID00011041	Don't ever say that name again.
GID00011042	He was a good spotter.
GID00011043	Yeah. We were.
GID00011044	No.
GID00011045	When Carla went missing he was the first person I told.
GID00011046	He tried to hide it, but I could tell right away. He was glad.
GID00011047	Sure.
GID00011048	Carla's dead. That's all you need to know.
GID00011049	I met Carla while I was at the Strip on leave. She said I looked lost.
GID00011050	She talked a lot. Suited me fine - I never know what to say. And listening to her, it could... make you forget.
GID00011051	She stuck out, pretty much everywhere we went. Like she was from a different time. A better time. I never met anyone like her.
GID00011052	No. I wanted to. I just couldn't.
GID00011053	Yeah. I don't know much. Just rumors.
GID00011054	All I know is he's supposed to be in charge of the Strip. And he's been able to stop the NCR from taking it over.
GID00011055	Wish he'd give it up, so the NCR could focus on securing the border.
GID00011056	Okay.
GID00011057	No. It doesn't.
GID00011058	It's NCR land, for the most part. We tamed it, now we're settling it.
GID00011059	Lot of people complain about it, but they forget what it was like before we showed up.
GID00011060	It's a lot of territory to secure. Too much, even for a big army like the NCR's.
GID00011061	Coming east was about securing the land, so people could live without fear.
GID00011062	It's not always that simple. But I think the cause is still right.
GID00011063	And God help us if they lose.
GID00011064	Yeah. Lots of thoughts. All about the best ways to kill them.
GID00011065	They got what they had coming. Glad we were the ones to deliver it.
GID00011066	Dark in here. If you want to use a scope, I can spot for you. Keep you on target.
GID00011067	It's possible, but I've yet to see any hard evidence or hear of any cases where humans were negatively affected.
GID00011068	Its negative effects are more pronounced on Nightkin.
GID00011069	Because Marcus asked me to and because it's a reason for me to get up in the morning. I'd like to get one more grand accomplishment done.
GID00011070	I'm not convinced that the Nightstalker mutation is a natural one, and I need someone to investigate their lair for proof.
GID00011071	Some of the Super Mutants have looked around as well, but they've come back empty-handed. Perhaps a pair of fresh eyes will have better luck.
GID00011072	Lily might be interested in coming with you - she's lost a few of her Bighorners to Nightstalker attacks and would enjoy a little revenge.
GID00011073	If we must.
GID00011074	[SUCCEEDED] You're right. I've been a mean son of a bitch the past couple years.
GID00011075	It won't be easy, but I'll try going sober. Maybe then my family will want me back.
GID00011076	Thank you for doing what you can. I won't let this go to waste.
GID00011077	[FAILED] They're my blood, man. You don't just walk away from your blood!
GID00011078	[FAILED] They're my blood, lady. You don't just walk away from your blood!
GID00011079	What?! Why won't you tell me?
GID00011080	Did my wife put you up to this?! What lies did she tell you?
GID00011081	[SUCCEEDED] Here, I don't have much left at this point. Please, just tell me where they are.
GID00011082	Dammit, I'll find them eventually! Mark my words!
GID00011083	[SUCCEEDED] You're right. I've been a mean son of a bitch the past couple years.
GID00011084	What am I supposed to do? I've got no money left, and now my family has abandoned me.
GID00011085	[FAILED] Well look who is all high and mighty! You're no better than me when it boils down, bub.
GID00011086	Crap, those goody-goodies kicked me out of there once already. No way I'm getting in.
GID00011087	Even if I could get in, rehab is for chumps. Well, thanks for doing what you could.
GID00011088	Guess I'll get a fresh start and keep an eye out in case they leave the Fort.
GID00011089	[SUCCEEDED] You're right. I've got nothing left...
GID00011090	I'll never see my kids grow up, but they're better off without me.
GID00011091	[FAILED] You think you're better than me? You're just like those goody-goody Followers of the Apocalypse.
GID00011092	Ha. I'm not saying. It's part of my mystique, after all.
GID00011093	I'm still not saying.
GID00011094	Well, ain't like I've got places to be.
GID00011095	Sure do. Had a wife for awhile - tribal girl, really pretty eyes - but she's been gone a long time now.
GID00011096	I'll be fine... eventually.
GID00011097	There won't be a next time. I hope.
GID00011098	I... may have overheard some things at Gomorrah that I passed on to the NCR. That's all! Honest.
GID00011099	Goodbye!
GID00011100	Oh. Um... okay.
GID00011101	What? I only talk to Captain Curtis over at McCarran. I would never work with slavers. Honest.
GID00011102	No! Well, not really. I mean, I'm not listening through doors or sneaking around or anything. People talk out loud, and I just pay attention.
GID00011103	The NCR likes to keep tabs on the activities of the families, and they pay me good caps to hang around the casinos and keep my ears open.
GID00011104	It isn't normally. The NCR wanted me to just gamble and listen, nothing else.
GID00011105	Okay.
GID00011106	I do odd jobs here and there, usually helping Sarah keep the Vault tidy. I came to New Vegas to be a professional gambler.
GID00011107	Too bad for me that the "professional" part isn't working out so good. But, I love gambling, so I'm here to stay on the Strip until they kick me out.
GID00011108	My name's Frank Weathers. I'm a farmer, got a few hundred acres near Junktown. Well, I was a farmer. I guess I'm not much of anything now.
GID00011109	They're cannibals, slavers, and worse.
GID00011110	I hear rumors they're poised to overrun the entire Colorado River Valley, and even the Army won't be enough to stop them.
GID00011111	One of the officers here, or at Camp McCarran, might be able to tell you more.
GID00011112	Why does anybody? I thought I'd strike it rich at the tables, make my fortune and never have to plow those damn fields again.
GID00011113	I just wanted to provide for my family - and now they're gone. All gone. God forgive me....
GID00011114	Yes? Have you found them?
GID00011115	We were crossing the Mojave, not far from Searchlight, when a band of Caesar's Legion slavers came out of nowhere. They took my family.
GID00011116	Caesar's Legion attacked us near Searchlight. The rangers say they probably took my family to Cottonwood Cove.
GID00011117	If you want me to stick around, that ends now. I don't care what the reasons are, I will not help the Legion. Ever. Got it?
GID00011118	Bullshit. You're a goddamned coward, trying to pick the winning side.
GID00011119	We will never work together again.
GID00011120	Then this is over. Next time I see you, it'll be through my scope.
GID00011121	Any Legion with you and I'm pulling the trigger.
GID00011122	I should never have trusted you.
GID00011123	All right. But we'd better not have to have this talk again.
GID00011124	Then we're finished here.
GID00011125	I should never have worked with you in the first place.
GID00011126	You're right. You won't.
GID00011127	Good thing I'm still alive, then.

GID00011291	Thumbs down, you son of a bitch.
GID00011292	Wish there was more of them. I wasn't done yet.
GID00011293	Heh. Yeah. That was some kind of stunt we pulled.
GID00011294	Whatever happens from here on out, we killed that prick in the middle of his fortress.
GID00011295	Ought to give the rest of them something to think about.
GID00011296	Intel we had back in the NCR said they had a whole succession lined up. They'll replace him as soon as word gets out.
GID00011297	The other thing I heard is that he wasn't really commanding the army anymore. Guess we made sure of that.
GID00011298	Yeah, it does. But we got these bastards pretty good today.
GID00011299	Goddamn it. We could've gotten them out.
GID00011300	Mercy killing is a last resort. Glad you recognized we had options.
GID00011301	To hell with mercy killing. We're getting those guys out of there.
GID00011302	Yeah.
GID00011303	Good luck to ya.
GID00011304	I do decent enough. The NCR patrols usually stop by for a quick bite, and travelers like yourself pass by a couple times a week.
GID00011305	The caravans or NCR patrols usually don't stop, but we usually get people like yourself wandering on by a few times a week.
GID00011306	Your belongings will be returned to you when you leave.
GID00011307	Your belongings will be returned to you when you leave.
GID00011308	This is your last warning. You will relinquish your weapons and banned items, or prepare to face the consequences.
GID00011309	This fool challenges the Legion, brothers! Let us teach him some manners!
GID00011310	Very well. Lucullus, escort this fool back to Cottonwood Cove.
GID00011311	Caesar strictly forbids the use of chems and alcohol. By his order, all visitors must also relinquish their arms upon entry.
GID00011312	If you come in peace, then there is no reason to not disarm. You will not be harmed unless Caesar wills it.
GID00011313	Alcohol and all chems, including stims and other addictive items.
GID00011314	[SUCCEEDED] I know not why Caesar would wish to speak with such a physically inferior whelp, but I will allow this one exception.
GID00011315	You may bear Caesar's mark, but do not attempt to share any of your medicine with anyone in The Fort.
GID00011316	[FAILED] Thus is Caesar's will. Do not test my patience.
GID00011317	Hmm, perhaps I was wrong about your skills. You've killed more NCR than most recruits.
GID00011318	Good, good! Your growing number of NCR kills rivals most legionaries.
GID00011319	Keep up the good work!
GID00011320	Ha! Perhaps I was wrong about your skills, Profligate. Your kill count rivals some of our best warriors!
GID00011321	How many?
GID00011322	As much as the Profligates' cowardice will allow. They haven't found the balls to attack us here, but we catch them out on patrols.
GID00011323	With two contubernia at my command, I've killed and captured four times my numbers.
GID00011324	It is the armor of a Centurion. You have the rare honor of beholding it unspattered by the blood of my inferiors.
GID00011325	The things the Profligates will build, to spy on us like cowards with little machines!
GID00011326	Find that officer and give him this old map of our patrol routes. The Profligates will try to set up ambushes... and we'll be waiting for them.
GID00011327	Vale.
GID00011328	Of course I am, you fool. I am a Centurion!
GID00011329	When Vulpes Inculta drove the NCR from Searchlight by clever means, Caesar himself ordered me to set up this camp and harass the Profligates!
GID00011330	It's a modest presence, a single finger of the Legion reaching across the river's narrows. But with me here, it has an iron knuckle.
GID00011331	Why would it bother me to enslave these wretches? They have no purpose, no creed, no honor.
GID00011332	They live in pitiful squalor, undisciplined, intemperate. To enslave them is to save them - to give them purpose, and virtue.
GID00011333	Honestas, Industria, Prudentia - even the virtues of slaves are beyond the Dissolute on this side of the river.
GID00011334	It's a weak bunch, to be honest. I'd rather have extra currency to buy supplies or better captures off traders.
GID00011335	There's a boy, too old to be trained as a Legionary. Normally they have to die, but he's too frail to make trouble.
GID00011336	The old woman's dried up, but she could keep house or do gardening - if she can learn to keep her mouth shut.
GID00011337	The girl's the only one of real value, young enough to breed, not hideous to look at. What's your offer for the lot?
GID00011338	Let me know if you change your mind.
GID00011339	Seems I'm fortunate to get that much for them, given the circumstances!
GID00011340	Here, this is the key to their collars. You'll want to take those off before you go far, trust me.
GID00011341	This isn't the total we agreed upon. Don't waste my time, wastelander.
GID00011342	It was easy. The Colorado is narrow here, and when the Profligates abandoned Searchlight, there was no one to guard the crossing.
GID00011343	It's just a small outpost, but we keep busy. Raiding parties go out, new captures come in.
GID00011344	I have Blackfoot in me, the first tribe that Caesar ever led in battle - the tribe that formed the Legion.
GID00011345	If not for him, we'd still be living in tents or shacks, scavenging for food like animals. If we were alive at all.
GID00011346	Vale.
GID00011347	The best Cursor in the Legion. You'll reach Fortification Hill without incident, that's for sure.
GID00011348	Wait until you see the encampment, how massive it is. And a personal audience with mighty Caesar - glorious!
GID00011349	Captures lose any claim to the names they called themselves when they let themselves be taken.
GID00011350	If they're fortunate enough to become slaves, a new name will be given to them - one they can be proud of.
GID00011351	Bye.
GID00011352	Why free me now? After what you done? I ain't saying thank you.
GID00011353	Bye.
GID00011354	[SUCCEEDED] Very well. You may proceed.
GID00011355	However, be warned. Aggressive acts against us will earn you a place on a cross.
GID00011356	[FAILED] Tread lightly, fool. You are entering Caesar's land.
GID00011357	Aggressive acts against us will earn you a place on a cross. Turn back now, or pay the consequences.
GID00011358	You wear the Mark of Caesar?! You must be who Cursor Lucullus is waiting for.
GID00011359	You may continue, but be warned. Mark or no, we will not tolerate aggressive action by visitors in the camp.
GID00011360	To arms, brothers!
GID00011361	Very well. You may proceed.
GID00011362	However, be warned. Aggressive acts against us will earn you a place on a cross.
GID00011363	Fool. Your deeds are known well among us.
GID00011364	To arms, my brothers!
GID00011365	Vale.
GID00011366	All who are not Legion are "Dissolute." They live in squalor, unrestrained by morality, lacking moderation, temper, and self-control.
GID00011367	Their very existence is a blight on the common good. Even worse are the Profligates, the subtype of Dissolute one finds this side of the river.
GID00011368	They hold themselves to be civilized, when in fact they are corrupt and self-interested. The truth will be made clear to them soon enough.
GID00011369	You'd know better than I would. But you must be remarkable, for Caesar to take such an interest.
GID00011370	Vale, as you wish. My orders are to wait here until you're ready to make the trip.
GID00011371	Women are physically and intellectually inferior to men. Their role is to bear children and ensure the survival of our species.
GID00011372	Not to say that all women are equally incapable. I trust Caesar will find a worthy use for you.
GID00011373	Very well.
GID00011374	Th-thank you! I don't know that we'll ever be able to repay you, but we'll do our best one day once I've found a place to settle.
GID00011375	Thank you! Thank you so much!
GID00011376	[SUCCEEDED] Finally! Let's get out of here!
GID00011377	[FAILED] I don't believe you. This key has to have been stolen.
GID00011378	None of the guards have said we're free to go. As soon as we step out of here, we're just going to get caught again, or worse.
GID00011379	One of these days we'll be free.
GID00011380	My family was ambushed by a pack of Legion raiders near Searchlight and Frank ran off, the gutless coward!
GID00011381	I have no idea where he is, but at least we're free from his abuse.
GID00011382	Why free me now? After what you done? I ain't saying thank you.
GID00011383	Momma...
GID00011384	Accident or not, you're to blame!
GID00011385	Wasting my time is more like it.
GID00011386	Vale.
GID00011387	If they're more powerful than the Profligates' landmines, by all means show me how.
GID00011388	Here, this is edible.
GID00011389	Here, this is edible.
GID00011390	Here, this is edible.
GID00011391	Here, this is edible.
GID00011392	Are we done, then?
GID00011393	Tin cans, gunpowder, scrap metal, and duct tape? We won't have any trouble finding those ingredients!
GID00011394	That would be worth knowing, especially if we can then rearm and reuse them.
GID00011395	[SUCCEEDED] The light is a button that can interrupt detonation? We were too busy throwing ourselves to the ground to figure that out.
GID00011396	To rearm the mine, we'd just press the button again - simple. The Profligates will regret that we learned this.
GID00011397	[FAILED] Go find a minefield and practice that "trick" several times, then. Idiot.
GID00011398	If you have nothing to teach, don't make the offer.
GID00011399	What of it?
GID00011400	So I'm supposed to just start giving in to the demands of random strangers that come in here, huh? I don't think so.
GID00011401	You want something from me, you're gonna have to earn it. And it just so happens that I've got a few things I need taken care of. So what do you say?
GID00011402	I'd love to help you, but it seems I can't even prevent my own friends from getting killed. I'm sorry as can be, but I can't help you.
GID00011403	Roger that. I'll have snipers move to position.
GID00011404	Confirmed. We'll stay with you and help you break through the line.
GID00011405	You are in charge of this operation. That sounds like a suicide mission, but our order are to take commands from you.
GID00011406	Unit, let's move out!
GID00011407	We aren't assigned for a suicide mission. Give us something we can do, and we'll do it. However I am not sending my unit on a suicide run.
GID00011408	Confirmed, we'll fall back. Good luck.
GID00011409	Yeah, I guess you're right. Here.
GID00011410	You give Lupa a worthy death in the arena, and her brain is yours. Don't let your guard down just because she's old, though.
GID00011411	Oh, and standard arena rules still apply. You don't get to wear armor and you get only a machete for a weapon.
GID00011412	Not too common but you still see 'em around.
GID00011413	All right. You've been a good dog, Lupa. Die well, girl.
GID00011414	Take all the time you need, otherwise Lupa will tear your throat out.
GID00011415	Damnit! I can't believe the Legion actually got someone past our security. Good job catching him.
GID00011416	I'll have a security team sweep the area to see if the Legion has any more surprises for us.
GID00011417	I'm also canceling the President's speech. We'll have a security team get him out of here right away. But let's not relax until he's safe.
GID00011418	Good timing. Looks like his Vertibird is arriving early. Here it comes now.
GID00011419	I hope you're up for this, because we won't get a second chance.
GID00011420	Well I have a bomb here that can be put on the vertibird that will detonate at a certain altitude, but it's a little unstable and dangerous.
GID00011421	Rise and shine. You have a big day ahead of you.
GID00011422	So, do you have a plan for how you're going to kill Kimball?
GID00011423	Thanks. We haven't been paired together long, but he's a smart dog.
GID00011424	Nope. Haven't noticed anything strange at all. Neither has my friend here, and he has a good nose for these things.
GID00011425	Not since the last time you asked, no.
GID00011426	Damnit! I can't believe the Legion actually got someone past our security. Good job catching him.
GID00011427	I'll have a security team sweep the area to see if the Legion has any more surprises for us.
GID00011428	I'm also canceling the President's speech. We'll have a security team get him out of here right away. But let's not relax until he's safe.
GID00011429	Then stay off the line and get back to work!
GID00011430	Only engineers and authorized personnel are allowed upstairs. Please step away.
GID00011431	I warned you. Intruder!
GID00011432	Move it, you curs!
GID00011433	There's still more killing to be done!
GID00011434	Keep moving!
GID00011435	I will personally gut the first man to slow down!
GID00011436	Leave none alive!
GID00011437	My men await in the tunnel below. I am to divide them between the dam top and the tunnels that lead to the western power plant.
GID00011438	The fighting in the power plant is the fiercest, as expected. But the dogs have been caught off guard, and their positions can expect no support.
GID00011439	However, the pipes below have been sealed, cutting off our men until the dam top can be secured.
GID00011440	I've been diverting half of my men to the tower next to this one. It's a bit of a swim, but the enemy hasn't sealed those pipes yet.
GID00011441	Some of the other centuriae are more stubborn in following their orders exactly, though, and wait in the pipes below.
GID00011442	If you should make it down there, unsealing the pipes again will allow us to spill over the enemy like a tide of blood.
GID00011443	More than a few, if I have my way.
GID00011444	[SUCCEEDED] Your words have merit... Very well. I shall tell my men to concentrate their efforts here.
GID00011445	[FAILED] I have my orders, and they explicitly state that I am to divide my men.
GID00011446	[SUCCEEDED] Agreed. If we take the power plant, this battle is over. I'll have my men focus their efforts there. May the Son of Mars go with you.
GID00011447	[FAILED] Forgive my appraisal of your prowess, but all the same I'd rather send some of my men with you to help secure the dam top.
GID00011448	This whole area used to be a Great Khan encampment before they relocated to Red Rock Canyon. We just haven't had the manpower to clean it all up yet.
GID00011449	Thanks. Your concern is touching.
GID00011450	That's very generous of you. I appreciate it.
GID00011451	Here, take this. I hope you put it to good use.
GID00011452	If a reward is all you're concerned with, here. Enjoy it.
GID00011453	Sure, but make them quick.
GID00011454	Ah. I should have expected as much. There's still a lot of bad blood between the Khans and the NCR, ever since the incident here.
GID00011455	Really? Well, this canyon used to be a Great Khan stronghold, I suppose that explains why he was able to evade us so easily.
GID00011456	The incident, yes. It was a tragic mistake, but the NCR has done everything it can to make amends since then.
GID00011457	About three years ago, this canyon was the main encampment for the Great Khans. NCR's 1st Recon tracked them here after a raid and made an attack.
GID00011458	There was a communication mix-up that resulted in some noncombatants being killed. It was a tragic mistake, but we've done all we can to make amends.
GID00011459	We provided medical aid to the wounded - all the wounded - and permitted the Khans to resettle at Red Rock Canyon.
GID00011460	I don't know how you did it, but thank you.
GID00011461	I'm glad it's taken care of, but still, I wish it could have been resolved without violence. There's too much bad blood there already.
GID00011462	Sure. What do you need?
GID00011463	About three years ago, NCR's 1st Recon launched an attack on the Khan encampment here.
GID00011464	There was a communication mix-up that resulted in some noncombatants being killed. I guess he was still bitter about it.
GID00011465	It was a tragic mistake, but we've done all we can to make amends.
GID00011466	[SUCCEEDED] As you wish.
GID00011467	[FAILED] I don't think so. If you work for the NCR, you're no better than they are. Flails of God!
GID00011468	[SUCCEEDED] As you wish.
GID00011469	Well, still. Thanks again.
GID00011470	Oh! Oh, yeah, sure, I think I can spare a little. Here. And thanks again.
GID00011471	Oh! Right, of course, I can give you a few spare meds and a few caps. Here.
GID00011472	No problem, here you go. I'm kind of amazed you found them at all. Thanks again for everything.
GID00011473	Really? Wow. Well, you did pay for them, so here you go. Thanks again for everything.
GID00011474	Alright. What do you want to know?
GID00011475	If you can find a way to cut off access to the sulfur in the caves below the vault, I've got some caps waiting for you.
GID00011476	Later.
GID00011477	See you around.
GID00011478	What do you want to know?
GID00011479	There are some fire geckos in the lower levels of the Vault. We need to get them gone so we can get to the sulfur.
GID00011480	You go clear them out for us, and there'll be some caps for you.
GID00011481	I want you to head to Red Rock Canyon, north of here. Find Papa Khan and ask him if he'd allow the Powder gangers to join up.
GID00011482	Bye.
GID00011483	See you around.
GID00011484	You bear the Mark of Caesar. That makes you special.
GID00011485	Do whatever Caesar tells you to do. And whenever the opportunity presents, strike at the Profligates. Pile body upon body.
GID00011486	Tell everyone you meet of what you saw here. The Legion can handle the rest.
GID00011487	That said, if you were to strike at the Profligates, butcher them, trouble their operations... this will not go unnoticed.
GID00011488	Indeed, our hounds demonstrate greater loyalty to each other every day than the wretched inhabitants of this town.
GID00011489	Nipton was a wicked place, debased and corrupt. It served all comers, so long as they paid.
GID00011490	Profligate troops, Powder Gangers, men of the Legion such as myself - the people here didn't care. It was a town of whores.
GID00011491	For a pittance, the town agreed to lead those it had sheltered into a trap. Only when I sprang it did they realize they were caught inside it, too.
GID00011492	Yes, and herded them to the center of town. I told them their sins, the foremost being disloyalty.
GID00011493	I told them that when Legionaries are disloyal, some are punished, the others made to watch. And I announced the lottery.
GID00011494	Each clutched his ticket, hoping it would set him free. Each did nothing, even when "loved ones" were dragged away to be killed.
GID00011495	Yes, they did. As will all the rest of you, in due time.
GID00011496	Now go, and teach what you've learned here. There will be more lessons in the days ahead.
GID00011497	Yes, they did. As will all the rest of them, in due time.
GID00011498	Now go, and teach them what you learned here. There will be more lessons in the days ahead.
GID00011499	You're unusually bright for a Profligate. Well done.
GID00011500	Now go, and teach what you've learned here. There will be more lessons in the days ahead.
GID00011501	It has a stark beauty, doesn't it? I'm glad you can appreciate it.
GID00011502	Now go, and teach them what you learned here. There will be more lessons in the days ahead.
GID00011503	Innocent? Hardly.
GID00011504	Cowardly, though. They outnumbered us, yet not once did they try to resist.
GID00011505	They stood and watched as their fellows were butchered, crucified, and burned, one by one.
GID00011506	They stood and hoped their turn would not come. Each cared only for himself.
GID00011507	I think your eyes will see more than I could ever tell you. Take your time. Enjoy the sights.
GID00011508	Why, then, do you keep asking?
GID00011509	Legatus Lanius, Monster of the East! Quite a man, if man he be.
GID00011510	Caesar prides himself on selecting the right tool to overcome each new obstacle. In Lanius, he found his hammer.
GID00011511	He's never been defeated in battle. 14 tribes have laid down arms at his boots. Another five, rendered extinct.
GID00011512	His latest campaign in the wilds of the Utah has concluded, and he is en route. When he arrives, your doom arrives with him.
GID00011513	What can be said? He's a man of towering intellect, the founder of the Legion, conquerer of 86 tribes.
GID00011514	Caesar is the salvation of mankind, his Legion the rebirth of civilization in a benighted age.
GID00011515	Don't worry, you'll know him well when you serve him. Or you'll be dead.
GID00011516	Him? When his ticket came up, they burned him alive on a pile of tires.
GID00011517	We get in position and next thing we know, we're surrounded by those fucking Legion freaks.
GID00011518	They dragged us and everybody else into the center of town. And that asshole with a dog on his head, he starts talking about how we're bad people!
GID00011519	He said we needed to be punished for what we did, not all of us, but some of us. And then he gives everyone a fucking lottery ticket...
GID00011520	Like what?
GID00011521	What do you think? He started drawing tickets, and that's how people got punished.
GID00011522	First up was the "lucky losers." They got decapitated - guess that's "lucky" because it's pretty quick.
GID00011523	Then came the crucifixions. Goddamn but those went on and on and on...
GID00011524	Third-place runners-up got enslaved. I got the fuck beat out of my legs, and the winner they let go free.
GID00011525	Yeah, a bunch of those Legion fucks dragged them off right away. They was headed East, if you're feeling heroic.
GID00011526	Don't act like you'd be doing me a favor. I don't give a fuck.
GID00011527	That's how I figure it. Got problems of my own to handle.
GID00011528	Then you're a fucking dream come true, ain't ya? How much you gonna give me?
GID00011529	Big fucking deal. Hand it over.
GID00011530	Good enough. Hand it over.
GID00011531	Three doses? That's almost enough for a party.
GID00011532	Five doses? Nice. A fella could put himself out of his misery with five doses.
GID00011533	Bullshit. You're holding, you just want it all for yourself!
GID00011534	Powder Ganger? What? I mean, yeah, used to be, sure!
GID00011535	But not no more! Powder Gang is small-time, man! I'm a winner! I won the motherfucking lottery!
GID00011536	Doctor's Bags would be a huge help too.
GID00011537	I think that should just about cover us. I really don't know how to thank you, bringing me these supplies saved a lot of people.
GID00011538	If I was the assassin, I'd be up on that ridge. Or if I didn't care about escaping, maybe that near tower, or the landing pad behind us.
GID00011539	You say so.
GID00011540	You'll be glad you did this. I'm gonna put a hole through Caesar's head.
GID00011541	Great Khan, looks like. Guess he fought at Bitter Springs. Or saw it happen.
GID00011542	Thanks. Anything else?
GID00011543	What? There's no way... we're miles from the Colorado. They...they aren't even waiting for the Dam to fall. They're already inside the borders...
GID00011544	...we'll never stop them, not at this rate. We're doomed. Thanks for bringing the word - even if the news is bad, I'll let the men know.
GID00011545	Legion!
GID00011546	First NCR Recon. It's a sniper battalion. Sees a lot of action.
GID00011547	They moved us around a lot. I was stationed at Camp Golf for a while. Last I heard they were at Camp McCarran.
GID00011548	They pick you out if you do well at the firing range. Pays a little better, so I said okay.
GID00011549	"The last thing you never see."
GID00011550	Pretty accurate, and so were we.
GID00011551	Yeah. You can tell by the patch. Bear skull with crossed rifles behind it. Slogan underneath.
GID00011552	Was an airport before the war. Command liked it because it was already fortified and it let them keep an eye on the Strip.
GID00011553	They've got an old monorail that still runs between them. Used mostly for supplies and deployment. But if you get leave you're allowed to go gamble.
GID00011554	Was General Oliver's post, but I heard he's been up at the Dam a lot lately. Guessing Colonel Hsu is running it.
GID00011555	It was on the front line for a while. Only resort in New Vegas no one wanted to get sent to.
GID00011556	Doesn't have that kind of importance anymore, though. They pulled most of the troops out of there after we took the Hoover Dam.
GID00011557	Didn't know him. He's a signature on my discharge papers.
GID00011558	Wasn't real popular, though. Even overheard my C.O. complain about him once.
GID00011559	"General Wait-and-see," he called him.
GID00011560	Yeah. He introduced himself to me once. I shook his hand. Doubt he'd remember me now, though.
GID00011561	When he looked at you, you could see he understood. After some of the things we'd seen, that meant something.
GID00011562	What I heard, he'd be a general right now if Oliver didn't know the president.
GID00011563	The big one. The one the NCR is trying to hold onto, that the Legion's pushing for. Whole war depends on holding it.
GID00011564	Okay. But let's make sure and come back here. I'd love to wipe this place off the map.
GID00011565	I don't think I'd hold it against you.
GID00011566	Fine. But if you make any new friends in there, all bets are off.
GID00011567	You're making a mistake. I want to be a part of this.
GID00011568	You ever change your mind, I'll be right there with you.
GID00011569	That's what the scope's for.
GID00011570	Damn right. You and I, we're just a couple of problem solvers.
GID00011571	If you're sure. There's a lot of high ground around the town. We could do a lot of damage.
GID00011572	Just saying.
GID00011573	Better be a good reason. I didn't join up with you to go on nature walks.
GID00011574	Goodbye.
GID00011575	Oh, it was great. I wouldn't trade it.
GID00011576	Something about that lifestyle, the discipline. Seeing new places, making people safe. What's not to like?
GID00011577	Ah, well... I just felt like it was time, you know? Wanted to have a home.
GID00011578	Plus I was up at Camp Golf when Bitter Springs went down. I faked like I was sick to get out of going, because I knew some of the people there.
GID00011579	But when everybody came back nobody would tell me what happened. And people would call us murderers sometimes when we showed up to secure towns.
GID00011580	I still don't know exactly. Just that a lot of people died who didn't want to be part of the fighting at all.
GID00011581	I don't blame anybody for it. There's so much chaos when you're fighting, you're lucky not to shoot your own guys.
GID00011582	But it did take something out of it for me. Just wasn't the same. So when it came time to re-enlist, I just took my papers and walked.
GID00011583	Sure thing.
GID00011584	Cursor Lucullus is waiting for you at the docks. He'll take you to Caesar.
GID00011585	[SUCCEEDED] No! Not like this!
GID00011586	[FAILED] I appreciate you trying, but you'll have to find another way to get us out of here.
GID00011587	You may find one in the workshop. You're a friend to the tribe, so I trust it will not find it's way into the wrong hands.
GID00011588	They are too rare and valuable to simply give away, nor have you proven yourself a friend.
GID00011589	[SUCCEEDED] All right, two it is. They'll still be more than enough to take you down, I think.
GID00011590	[FAILED] No deal. You and four of my dogs. Not two, not three - four.
GID00011591	And just about every one of them is occupied. Not all at the same time, usually - groups of Legionaries come and go all the time.
GID00011592	This also only one camp of many. You might have noticed the other camps down by the river.
GID00011593	They do say that! I guess you can be my friend.
GID00011594	Um... can you help me?
GID00011595	A bomb on the President's vertibird? Only a limited number of people had access to the vertibird.
GID00011596	We have to get the President out of here now. I'll cancel the speech and have security search the area.
GID00011597	We can't relax until we get the President out of here safely.
GID00011598	What the hell? This must control some sort of bomb that he was going to use to kill the President.
GID00011599	Nice work catching this. I'll have my Rangers go deal with this man right away.
GID00011600	I've heard of you. I'm glad you're here to help us out. This is a delicate matter and we need all the help we can get from people we can trust.
GID00011601	We've got a lot to do to prepare for the President's visit and not much time. Once we start we'll be on a strict timetable.
GID00011602	So you're the one Mr. House sent. His Securitron here informed me of what's going on.
GID00011603	Since Mr. House has helped me in the past, I'll let you help us during the President's visit. However, I will be keeping an eye on you.
GID00011604	We've got a lot to do to prepare for the President's visit and not much time. Once we start we'll be on a strict timetable.
GID00011605	So you're the one Colonel Moore sent to help out with the President's visit. Well, I'm running security for the visit, which means I'm in charge.
GID00011606	If anything goes down, you tell me first, you got that?
GID00011607	We've got a lot to do to prepare for the President's visit and not much time. Once we start we'll be on a strict timetable.
GID00011608	Are you ready?
GID00011609	Looks like that's his vertibird coming right now. It's show time, let's not mess this up.
GID00011610	Now if you'll excuse me I've got some security procedures to oversee.
GID00011611	For revenge! The NCR committed an atrocity here, an atrocity that they tried to bury and forget. I'm going to remind them.
GID00011612	[SUCCEEDED] I know that. But what else can I do?
GID00011613	[FAILED] Keep deluding yourself if you want. I've seen the NCR's true face.
GID00011614	Maybe... maybe you're right. Maybe three years is vengeance enough. Thank you for helping me see that.
GID00011615	Here. This will unlock the supply caches we left in caves around these mountains. You might get some use out of them.
GID00011616	You're right. A Khan's vengeance should be direct and bloody. No more skulking in caves - I'll remind the NCR why they feared us!
GID00011617	Then you'll have to kill me. My vengeance will not be stayed.
GID00011618	Why should I let you leave? You could lead the NCR right to me. I should kill you now.
GID00011619	As you wish.
GID00011620	Our creatures come from the farthest reaches of the Wasteland. The Thorn takes care of them until the time to spill their blood comes.
GID00011621	We constantly replenish our stock to keep this holy ground soaked red. Only a few brave ones ever earn the honor of serving The Thorn.
GID00011622	Think you have what it takes? Hmm, all right. Prove your worth and I'll reward your service.
GID00011623	The Thorn needs newborn specimens that will one day grow to honor us with their blood.
GID00011624	Bring me a dozen Giant Mantis' eggs. If you accomplish this, I might gift you with greater tasks in the future.
GID00011625	Bring me a dozen Giant Mantis' eggs. If you accomplish this, I might gift you with greater tasks in the future.
GID00011626	You'll find egg-carrying Mantises in The Wasteland. But a wise hunter would search at a Mantis' breeding ground, like the nearby ruins of Vault 22.
GID00011627	You've got yourself a deal.
GID00011628	So long, stranger.
GID00011629	So long, stranger.
GID00011630	We constantly replenish our stock to keep this holy ground soaked red. Only a few brave ones ever earn the honor of servicing The Thorn.
GID00011631	Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
GID00011632	You speak the truth, stranger, and The Thorn lives by the justice that honor and strength dispense. Here's a more fitting sum.
GID00011633	Those are the risks of a hunter's life. I've delivered as promised, but perhaps I should better search for someone with greater resolve and honor?
GID00011634	Bring me a dozen Radscorpion eggs. I'll see to it that you're rewarded fairly.
GID00011635	Bring me a dozen Fire Gecko eggs. This great challenge will earn you a matching reward.
GID00011636	The Thorn's calling its elite hunters to collect one of its deadliest creatures. Find Night Stalker eggs and your bravery will be greatly rewarded.
GID00011637	I'm asking our top hunters to gather Cazador eggs. I'd be impressed by whoever returns with such a prize.
GID00011638	This is it, hunter. I've decided to grant you the opportunity to earn the greatest honor The Thorn could ever expect.
GID00011639	Deathclaws are our most precious and our most feared contenders. I want you to be the one to deliver the sacred eggs to me, personally.
GID00011640	I thank you, stranger. The Thorn thanks you.
GID00011641	Don't think your servile gesture earns my respect, stranger. But if that's how you want it, so it'll be.
GID00011642	The eggs I seek are not easy to find, stranger. Your best chances are in the mountains north of Goodsprings, and west from Quarry Junction.
GID00011643	You've got yourself a deal.
GID00011644	So long, stranger.
GID00011645	So long, stranger.
GID00011646	Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
GID00011647	You're proving your worth to The Thorn. I hope these extra caps are sufficient to demonstrate my fairness.
GID00011648	Those are the risks of a hunter's life. I've delivered as promised, but perhaps I should better search for someone with greater resolve and honor?
GID00011649	Thank you, stranger. The Thorn thanks you.
GID00011650	Don't think your servile gesture earns my respect, stranger. But if that's how you want it, so it'll be.
GID00011651	Fire Geckos are among The Wasteland's most dangerous creatures. Near the Ireteba Peaks lies a nest where you may find their eggs.
GID00011652	Confident, I like that.
GID00011653	So long, stranger.
GID00011654	So long, stranger.
GID00011655	Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
GID00011656	You are a match to my elite, but don't congratulate yourself so profusely just yet. Still, your valor deserves recognition and I shall honor it.
GID00011657	Those are the risks of a hunter's life. I've delivered as promised, but perhaps I should better search for someone with greater resolve and honor?
GID00011658	Night Stalkers are amongst the most fearsome beasts you'll ever face. They're also hard to find, but I know of a nest at a cave near Bittersprings.
GID00011659	Confident, I like that.
GID00011660	So long, stranger.
GID00011661	So long, stranger.
GID00011662	Thank you, stranger. The Thorn thanks you.
GID00011663	Don't think your servile gesture earns my respect, stranger. But if that's how you want it, so it'll be.
GID00011664	Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
GID00011665	Do you have good news for The Thorn?
GID00011666	You speak the truth, stranger, and The Thorn lives by the justice that honor and strength dispense. Here's a more fitting sum.
GID00011667	Those are the risks of a hunter's life. I've delivered as promised, but perhaps I should better search for someone with greater resolve and honor?
GID00011668	Thank you, stranger. The Thorn thanks you.
GID00011669	That actually manages to surprise me, stranger. I'm starting to believe that there's something special about you.
GID00011670	Cazadores are extremely deadly, but they are also reclusive. Try looking near the Red Rock's canyons.
GID00011671	The crowd loves your bravery.
GID00011672	So long, stranger.
GID00011673	So long, stranger.
GID00011674	Good work, stranger. The Thorn will nurture these eggs until their hatchlings are ready to bleed for us.
GID00011675	Here's a compensation for your service. I trust that we're in agreement over it.
GID00011676	You are a match to my elite, but don't congratulate yourself so profusely just yet. Still, your valor deserves recognition and I shall honor it.
GID00011677	Those are the risks of a hunter's life. I've delivered as promised, but perhaps I should better search for someone with greater resolve and honor?
GID00011678	Thank you, stranger. The Thorn thanks you.
GID00011679	That actually manages to surprise me, stranger. I'm starting to believe that there's something special about you.
GID00011680	Quarry Junction is overrun with Deathclaws, but you may stand a better chance at a nest near the Repconn Test Site.
GID00011681	I've come to expect nothing less from you, brave stranger.
GID00011682	I've come to expect nothing less from you, brave stranger.
GID00011683	You've done enough to last many lifetimes, stranger. But... I'd like you to come see me, again.
GID00011684	Thank you, my brave hunter.
GID00011685	Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
GID00011686	Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
GID00011687	Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
GID00011688	You know what I'd be real excited about? If you'd showed up and saved me before they smashed my legs.
GID00011689	Now why don't you fuck off and let me sleep, hero? That'd be real exciting, too.
GID00011690	Refugee camp? Is that what they're calling it? Good old NCR, they can whitewash anything.
GID00011691	Let me tell you something, that refugee camp? It's built on the blood and tears of my people. Nobody likes to talk about it, but I remember.
GID00011692	Come for me then. Flails of God!
GID00011693	Come for me then. Flails of God!
GID00011694	We were the Flails of God. The scourge of the Mojave, the best warriors and raiders in the Wasteland. Until the NCR tracked us back to Bitter Springs.
GID00011695	The main force hit the canyon by surprise. While our warriors tried to hold them off, we sent our women, our children, our old through the Red Pass.
GID00011696	NCR's First Recon Battalion was waiting for them on Coyote Tail Ridge. No Khan left alive, that was the order. My family....
GID00011697	Ta-ta.
GID00011698	I think we're clear.
GID00011699	Thought my time had come. For a minute there everything made sense. I could feel the end coming. I was ready for it.
GID00011700	Now... I'm back where I was.
GID00011701	Guess I did. Guess I figured whatever we could handle, this time the Legion was going to send more.
GID00011702	I should've died here a long time ago. When I spotted the legionaries today I thought I understood. Things were finally going to even out.
GID00011703	But I'm still here and nothing's changed.
GID00011704	I guess they brought us here. One less Legion raiding party running loose now. Never a bad thing, you can take my word for that.
GID00011705	Still feels like I'm living on borrowed time. But I don't see any reason not to take a lot more of those sons of bitches with me.
GID00011706	You got a point. There's still some things I can do before all this is over.
GID00011707	I don't mean disrespect. It's a hell of a thing having someone with your ability looking out for me.
GID00011708	But I've come to believe that there are things nobody can stop. I thought for sure that's what we'd finally come up against today.
GID00011709	It would've made sense for things to end here. But now... I'm still waiting.
GID00011710	<Sighs> Goddamn it. It's like I'm being toyed with.
GID00011711	I don't know what I'm supposed to do about all this.
GID00011712	If that's how it is, there's not a lot of comfort in knowing it.
GID00011713	I never thought of it that way. Always expected something... more final. But maybe it is.
GID00011714	With the Khans, the only difference between a soldier and a civilian is that the civilian is more likely to miss when he shoots at you.
GID00011715	Maybe Bitter Springs just seemed different. Maybe it's the same as killing legionaries.
GID00011716	They'd have died whether or not they were soldiers. Whether or not I was there. And my leaving the NCR hasn't stopped any wars or saved any lives.
GID00011717	There's no controlling war. No sense regretting what you can't stop.
GID00011718	We need to get to the camp before they do!
GID00011719	More coming!
GID00011720	Alice McLafferty runs the Crimson Caravan. You can find her over in the main office.
GID00011721	I'm getting ready to run a caravan up towards Utah. There's a town called New Canaan which is supposed to be pretty prosperous.
GID00011722	The Crimson Caravan doesn't have any branches out that way, so it'll be up to me get to things started.
GID00011723	Yeah, he used to come around here a lot. Haven't seen him in a while, though. Why?
GID00011724	He used to go on and on about water and the farms east of the Strip. He was talking to one of the farmers named Bascom, had some problem with NCR.
GID00011725	Boring as hell, but it was his money and his time, so I let him talk about whatever.
GID00011726	Don't be a stranger.
GID00011727	Fuck off. You already screwed me once, and it's not happening again.
GID00011728	A hundred caps. No kissing, no rough stuff.
GID00011729	Fifty caps, just like we agreed.
GID00011730	We can go right over here, baby.
GID00011731	Well now, that's unusual. Normally no one cares enough to ask. To be honest, I don't rightly know. My mama was from around these parts.
GID00011732	I can remember her face, but not her name. More than I can remember of my daddy, I guess. We lived in Westside before the Omertas bought me.
GID00011733	As bad as it can be some days in here, it's better than living in that dump.
GID00011734	Suit yourself. The offer's always open if you feel like changing your mind.
GID00011735	We can go right over here, baby.
GID00011736	Hmm... I don't know. Doesn't that... mess you up?
GID00011737	[SUCCEEDED] Well, if you know what you're doing... okay. You show me a good time, and I'll return the favor.
GID00011738	[FAILED] That's nice, honey, but no thanks.
GID00011739	[SUCCEEDED] Well... no I guess not. Okay - you show me a good time, and I'll return the favor.
GID00011740	[FAILED] Um... it's sweet of you to offer, but no thanks.
GID00011741	Yeah, you're right. For you, and just you, fifty caps. Don't tell anyone.
GID00011742	We can go right over here, baby.
GID00011743	Yeah, you are different from my usual guys. Fine, fifty caps, but don't tell anyone.
GID00011744	Too bad, baby. Come back when you have the caps. I'll still be here.
GID00011745	Forget it, it's done.
GID00011746	So, what else did you want?
GID00011747	Ugh. I figured you were a bit slow, but I never thought - forget it, it's done.
GID00011748	Fuck you. So what do you want now?
GID00011749	Too bad, baby. You know where to find me.
GID00011750	Tell the truth... I think this is exactly what I've been waiting for.
GID00011751	Let's go up there first, huh?
GID00011752	Something's wrong. Got a group coming our way. Looks like a Legion raiding party. It's big.
GID00011753	It might be too big.
GID00011754	Main force got spotted too soon. We heard shooting. Then Khans started coming through Canyon 37 in bunches.
GID00011755	It was all wrong, though. Women, kids, elderly. Wounded started coming through, too.
GID00011756	We radioed to confirm our orders but command didn't get what we were seeing. They told us to shoot till we were out of ammo. So that's what we did.
GID00011757	Yeah, I guess not.
GID00011758	Yeah, well. I'm not a soldier anymore. Those rules don't seem like much of an excuse now.
GID00011759	Anyway... I don't know why we're here. Thought maybe it'd help me see things better.
GID00011760	I'd like to stay here for the night. Think some things over.
GID00011761	Maybe not. Maybe I wouldn't have either at one point. But that's why they train you. Break you down till you're automatic.
GID00011762	With the Khans, any of them can be dangerous. There's a lot you can't see through a scope.
GID00011763	Still. I often wonder the same thing.
GID00011764	You can do what you want, but I'm not going anywhere.
GID00011765	No. I only would've needed one bullet to do things right that day.
GID00011766	All right. We won't stay for long.
GID00011767	Fine, but I'd still like to when we get a chance.
GID00011768	Easy target for grabbing slaves. Bunch of refugees, just a few soldiers defending it.
GID00011769	I don't think they're here for us. Too bad. Would've made me feel good about myself.
GID00011770	Ha! If only it was this easy all the time.
GID00011771	I'm not. Always figured this was how it was gonna end for me. Just didn't know when.
GID00011772	That day you showed up in Novac, I had a feeling I was supposed to go with you. That it was time to end all this.
GID00011773	And now I know.
GID00011774	Well, things aren't great here, but I've seen a lot worse. We've got the Fiends to the south of us, and that ain't good.
GID00011775	The Scorpions hang out at the Monte Carlo when they aren't slinging chems or getting their heads blown off by the Fiends.
GID00011776	Probably the best thing we've got going on is the co-op, run by Mr. Ettienne. Gets some help from of the Followers of the Apocalypse, I think.
GID00011777	Not so much lately. The NCR is giving them hell any time they poke their damned heads out. Bless those boys and gals for getting rid of that vermin.
GID00011778	I feel pity for any man or woman that gets addicted to chems, but when they prey on decent folk... well, then it's time to put 'em down.
GID00011779	Not much to tell. Typical gang of dumb bullies and angry nobodies. They're holed up a bit south of here, in the Monte Carlo Suites.
GID00011780	They think they're tough, but any time they tangle with the Fiends, they get torn right up.
GID00011781	Food from the people and for the people. Anyone can buy, but the profits are shared by the folks who make the produce.
GID00011782	Locals got these little gardens that do real well. Gosh darn well, truth be told. Ettienne got some help from that Anderson kid, I think.
GID00011783	Anyway, we don't gotta rely on merchants so much. And it means the troopers can use all the food they make over on the east side. Works out nice.
GID00011784	Oh, heh. Yeah, that's Mean Sonofabitch. I know the name sounds bad, but he likes it. He's one nasty old coot.
GID00011785	Far as I can tell, he's one of them original Super Mutants, what came from the Boneyard. Wandered about after that "Master" fellow died.
GID00011786	Eventually got caught somewhere around the Hub, back in NCR. Boy, they sure treated him mean down there. Cut him up so bad he can't talk no more.
GID00011787	I tried to buy him, just so they'd stop hurting him, but they didn't want any of it.
GID00011788	I run the liquor store in Westside. With things this rough, some folks need a lot of booze just to step out the door in the morning.
GID00011789	After I close up shop, I walk around and help keep the peace. Not that I'm good with a gun, mind you, but someone's got to do it, you know?
GID00011790	Sure.
GID00011791	What else did you want to chat about?
GID00011792	He just showed up here one day. Couldn't really talk, but he remembered me all right.
GID00011793	Ever since then he's just been, well... hanging around, I guess. Does odd jobs for folks and smashes the bad guys when they come poking around.
GID00011794	Some folks steer clear of him, for sure, but he don't seem to mind.
GID00011795	Turned out some of them "Night Kids" - whatever you call those sneaky Super Mutant types - got in and busted him out.
GID00011796	I guess somebody named "Tabitha" led the bunch that freed him. Don't know much more than that.
GID00011797	Take care.
GID00011798	I'll surrender on one condition - you protect Westside's secret. Without that water, this community won't survive long.
GID00011799	I'll say that White and I had a... falling out over a woman. A crime of passion, if you will.
GID00011800	Thank you. I won't make any trouble when they come for me.
GID00011801	Then you leave me no choice.
GID00011802	Ten percent of the co-op's profits.
GID00011803	Good. Tell Etienne about our deal and I'll turn myself in.
GID00011804	Then we have an agreement. Thank you for keeping my secret - such a thing will never happen again.
GID00011805	If the NCR thinks White was killed by, say, members from the Scorpions gang, it may be enough for them to close the case.
GID00011806	Thank you. What happened was regrettable, but I'll make sure it never happens again.
GID00011807	[SUCCEEDED] Twenty percent it is. Etienne won't like it, but at least our secret will be safe.
GID00011808	I'll turn myself in. Thank you for understanding.
GID00011809	[SUCCEEDED] Twenty percent it is. Etienne won't like it, but at least our secret will be safe.
GID00011810	Thank you for keeping my secret. I'll make sure that nothing like it ever happens again.
GID00011811	[FAILED] You ask too much. We barely make a profit as it is.
GID00011812	Perhaps a partnership in the co-op would be enough. Say, ten percent of daily profits?
GID00011813	That's not a bargain I can accept. Westside depends on that water for survival and self-reliance.
GID00011814	No, no, no - they haven't yet earned the right to be called "slaves"! Those three in the pen are captures, nothing more.
GID00011815	I'm a Slavemaster, so I know what I'm talking about. Back at the Fort, I'd have those three half-broken and well on their way.
GID00011816	But this is just a holding area, so all I do is assess their fitness and decide whether to send them on.
GID00011817	[SUCCEEDED] Pustulah -- what? Is that contagious? That doesn't sound good at all!
GID00011818	[FAILED]I think my Latin is better than yours. I inspect all the captives myself, and there was no "dentata."
GID00011819	A fair price. Always best to have caps on hand in case traders stop by.
GID00011820	Here's the key to their collars. You want to take those off before you've gone far, trust me.
GID00011821	Seems I'm fortunate to get that much for them, given the circumstances!
GID00011822	Here, this is the key to their collars. You'll want to take those off before you go far, trust me.
GID00011823	Please do. An outbreak of pustulah-whatever is the last thing we need.
GID00011824	What have you done?
GID00011825	Are you trying to get me killed? Get away from me!
GID00011826	No way! I seen what happens when you mess with these collars!
GID00011827	Sounds like I don't have much choice.
GID00011828	[SUCCEEDED] Hey, you did it! Nice work!
GID00011829	[FAILED] Forget it, I'm not gonna get my head blown off just because you don't know what you're doing!
GID00011830	Good idea. I'd like to keep my head intact.
GID00011831	Sorry, I'm just glad someone is doing something. The last thing I need is to be made some legionaire's bitch and sent off to God knows where.
GID00011832	That man knows where we are? Just when I didn't think this could get any worse!
GID00011833	At least he's too much of a coward to come after us himself. What if he'd ended up in this pen with us?
GID00011834	Th-thank you! I don't know that we'll ever be able to repay you, but we'll do our best one day once I've found a place to settle.
GID00011835	[SUCCEEDED] You think we can make it? You really do?
GID00011836	FREEDOM!
GID00011837	[SUCCEEDED] You think we can make it? You really do?
GID00011838	[FAILED] Are you crazy? They'd run us down in an instant!
GID00011839	If you want to help us, you'll have to come up with something better than suicide!
GID00011840	No way. If the guard catches you, we'll be beaten.
GID00011841	If you want to help, get that gate unlocked or see if you can get the one they call Canyon Runner to let us go.
GID00011842	All you're doing is killing us! Leave us alone!
GID00011843	If there's any chance you can free us, it's worth the risk...
GID00011844	[SUCCEEDED] My goodness! I swear my heart skipped a beat!
GID00011845	[FAILED] That's enough of that! If you're going to get us out of here, it'll have to be another way.
GID00011846	Anything that gets us out of here, please.
GID00011847	[SUCCEEDED] Why? Why?
GID00011848	[FAILED] Okay, you can quit. I don't know what you're trying to do, but it ain't helping.
GID00011849	So you can kill more of us? Get away from me!
GID00011850	If you say so... you know these collars have a bomb in them, don't you?
GID00011851	Hurry up. The guards keep eyeing me like I'm a piece of meat.
GID00011852	[SUCCEEDED] You did it! Thank you so much!
GID00011853	[FAILED] Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there. It is obvious you don't know what you're doing!
GID00011854	Yeah, like get the key from the slavemaster or pay him to release us?
GID00011855	Here.
GID00011856	Here.
GID00011857	Here.
GID00011858	Here.
GID00011859	Here.
GID00011860	Here.
GID00011861	Take it.
GID00011862	Dynamite or grenades?
GID00011863	Watch yourself with this.
GID00011864	Watch yourself with this.
GID00011865	Take it.
GID00011866	Take it.
GID00011867	Take it.
GID00011868	This is your size.
GID00011869	This is your size.
GID00011870	Excellent. You've done very well indeed. These tribals will make useful machete fodder.
GID00011871	And if it should turn out we need their land later, well, it's not like we don't have the force to drive them out again.
GID00011872	In the meantime, however, I have something else I want you to look into.
GID00011873	We've had some disturbing reports recently concerning the Omertas, one of the Three Families that run the Strip.
GID00011874	Our intelligence has discovered that high ranking members of the Omertas have been having clandestine meetings for the past several months.
GID00011875	We haven't been able to determine whom they've been meeting with, but if it's Caesar's men, we'll need to act.
GID00011876	I need you to uncover what they're up to, and stop it if it threatens the NCR. Any questions?
GID00011877	Then stop wasting my time and get on it!
GID00011878	Since the majority of my men are on assignment dealing with the Legion, I need someone to handle other matters that have arisen.
GID00011879	Make no mistake, there's a battle coming, and I intend to make sure there are no loose ends when the time comes.
GID00011880	One such loose end is a gang known as the Great Khans. Have you heard of them?
GID00011881	But not too busy to come all the way out here? I don't think so. Stay a while, and listen to my offer.
GID00011882	Then I don't need to tell you that they can be a pain in the ass.
GID00011883	The NCR has a rather sordid history with them, and I'm concerned that we'll find them aiding our enemies when the Legion attack comes.
GID00011884	That is, unless we get to them first. I want you to visit them in their canyons to the far west and make sure they're in no shape to join the Legion.
GID00011885	They're just another gang of raiders as far as I'm concerned, so deal with them appropriately. Any questions?
GID00011886	Good, that anger is something I can use, and I think you may get a chance to settle your score sooner than you might have planned.
GID00011887	They're a rowdy bunch, and pride themselves as warriors. The dark leather and horned helmets they wear are pretty distinctive.
GID00011888	Then you'll need to make sure none of them are left to do so. Any other questions?
GID00011889	I can't lend you any troops, but I've already sent word to quartermaster Bardon that you're to be given full access to our hardware.
GID00011890	You'll have to pay for what you take, however. We can't afford to give away equipment. Did you have any other questions?
GID00011891	Good. I look forward to hearing of your progress.
GID00011892	Dismissed.
GID00011893	Liza O'Malley at the Embassy may have some information for you as well.
GID00011894	Dismissed.
GID00011895	Good riddance. We've had reports for years that they're the ones who supply the Fiends with chems, but no one's done anything about it.
GID00011896	In any event, no one will miss them. And I've got another mission for you.
GID00011897	Head to their casino, Gomorrah, and ask around. If you discover that what they're up to threatens the NCR, stop it.
GID00011898	The Omertas themselves likely won't be forthcoming, so you may need to talk to some of their help to pick up a trail. Anything else?
GID00011899	Our preliminary research shows that the Omertas used to do some business in Freeside, mostly buying weapons. Any other questions?
GID00011900	Excellent. You'd think living in the lap of luxury and power would be enough for some people, but no.
GID00011901	But we have other problems. While investigating the Omertas, what little I could on my end, I came across something much more sinister.
GID00011902	Evidence suggests that Mr. House is planning to make some kind of move when the battle breaks out, and I'm guessing he won't be coming to our rescue.
GID00011903	While we don't know what his exact plans are, my orders are to avoid all risks. I'm sending you to take Mr. House out of the equation. Any questions?
GID00011904	Now that that's out of the way, let's see... Mr. House was a concern, but someone conveniently dealt with him for us.
GID00011905	Oh, that reminds me, you might be happy to know that your efforts haven't gone unnoticed.
GID00011906	The next time we speak, I expect you to have something for me.
GID00011907	[SUCCEEDED] I wouldn't dismiss it that lightly, but it's nothing we need get involved with for now. Good work, I suppose.
GID00011908	[FAILED] I highly doubt that. You'd do well to report only facts to me, otherwise we might have ourselves a problem.
GID00011909	However, their activity has quieted down some so maybe my original information was wrong.
GID00011910	If you must, but please keep it brief.
GID00011911	But he's still alive? I'll have to remember to send someone to follow up on that later. Anyway, at least he's out of the picture for the time being.
GID00011912	You might be happy to know that your efforts haven't gone unnoticed, either.
GID00011913	The brass have been throwing around the idea of having the president visit the dam for a while now. To rally the troops and boost morale and such.
GID00011914	With our recent achievements, they finally feel secure enough to stage the damn thing. But while it's being planned, I have one last mission for you.
GID00011915	Several years ago, we managed to wrest the HELIOS One solar power station from the Brotherhood of Steel chapter local to this area.
GID00011916	It was a crushing victory, but no one's heard a peep from the Brotherhood since. Most people assume the Brotherhood is scattered and not a threat.
GID00011917	Recently we've had scouts go missing in an area west of HELIOS, and I'm concerned that the Brotherhood is involved.
GID00011918	I want you to find them, and once you do, finish them for good. Any questions?
GID00011919	Then that's one more nuisance we won't have to worry about. Good work. Our efforts haven't gone unnoticed, either.
GID00011920	I shouldn't have to say this, but please don't bother me until the mission is completed.
GID00011921	No, just because you secured the aid of the Khans, assuming they don't try to kill us, don't think the Brotherhood will be so easily swayed.
GID00011922	These are people that both hate us *and* outgun us. There can be no compromise. Anything else?
GID00011923	Don't even think about it. Any Brotherhood survivors likely harbor a deep grudge against us. We can't afford to leave such an enemy alive.
GID00011924	Any other objections? Maybe you'd like to bring the Brotherhood some flowers?
GID00011925	A fair question, and one I've had our strategists think about for some time. Their consensus is that we must focus on the one thing we can count on.
GID00011926	With the Brotherhood that's their obsessive attachment to technology. They'd never go anywhere that didn't have working power.
GID00011927	I'm willing to bet that wherever they're hiding, there's a working reactor powering their equipment. That's their vulnerability.
GID00011928	Detonate that reactor, and we can safely cross the Brotherhood off our list of concerns. Was there anything else?
GID00011929	After the battle, we consolidated our hold on the plant before pursuing our enemies.
GID00011930	It was a mistake, to be sure, but there wasn't really any place for them to go. When we finally gave chase, however, they had simply vanished.
GID00011931	Some of our people think they had some means of conveyance, like the vertibirds the Enclave used, and hightailed it out of here.
GID00011932	I think that they found someplace to hide close to HELIOS, and never went that far at all. Any other questions?
GID00011933	Dismissed.
GID00011934	Ah, that's a relief. A Brotherhood attack while we're busy with the Legion would be catastrophic.
GID00011935	The situation being what it is, we can't afford to lose even a single man unnecessarily.
GID00011936	Don't give up. They're out there, somewhere, and we're not safe until they've been destroyed.
GID00011937	And you believed them? Do you have any idea how long we've been fighting those bastards?
GID00011938	Ugh, Crocker will have a field day with this. He'll want to establish diplomatic relations with them, for pete's sake.
GID00011939	But we've got more important matters to attend to. The president is due to arrive soon, and we're sure the Legion won't waste such an opportunity.
GID00011940	I want you to assist the security detail we've prepared for the president. His safety is critical to maintaining the mens' fighting spirit.
GID00011941	Go up to the visitor center and speak to Ranger Grant. He's in charge of security during the president's visit. Dismissed.
GID00011942	Good, his death could have had a major impact on morale. This whole affair was ill-advised from the start, and I for one am glad it's over.
GID00011943	While you were out, General Oliver arrived and briefed all senior officers regarding a change in our strategy.
GID00011944	I'm not at liberty to divulge what was said, but I've been instructed to send you to him immediately.
GID00011945	He's set up his camp in the office area at the south end of this power plant.
GID00011946	Dismissed.
GID00011947	Damn it! The timing couldn't be any worse. I tried to warn those buffoons, but they insisted on this little show.
GID00011948	We'll be lucky if the men don't throw down their guns and surrender as the Legion approaches. I guess there's nothing to be done about it now.
GID00011949	Then what the hell are you doing down here? Get back topside and protect the president!
GID00011950	This is no time for questions! Get back topside and protect the president!
GID00011951	Hmm.
GID00011952	I think that you should be able to divert the flow of the water into the generator turbines. That would grind them up like hamburger.
GID00011953	The computer to activate it is just ahead, but you may need to go outside to activate the manual override. That system hasn't been used in a while.
GID00011954	Ok, be careful out there.
GID00011955	Good luck. I'm going to find a place to not get shot.
GID00011956	I think they'll probably end up killing you. I trained them myself. But, if you do win somehow, the mongrels will at least get honorable deaths.
GID00011957	I thought something was wrong. We usually have to pull them off any visitors to the Fort.
GID00011958	Well, that's no fun. Take the bear. I'll find them something else to chew on.
GID00011959	Take the bear. I can't believe I let some of my best dogs get killed over this stupid thing.
GID00011960	Your stuff is in the crate next to the arena entrance. Leave it there too long and we'll dump it in the lake.
GID00011961	Huh. I could've sworn I had that stupid bear on me. Well, tough luck for you, I guess.
GID00011962	You do that.
GID00011963	Good luck - you'll need it.
GID00011964	Lupa? Yes, she's the mother of a lot of our best dogs. She's getting old, but she's still a tough old bitch. Aren't you, girl?
GID00011965	Antony took Sergeant Teddy away and gave him to the stinky dogs. I want him back!
GID00011966	He's a toy. I'm not a baby, you know.
GID00011967	I kept him secret, but I think somebody told on me.
GID00011968	Oh, okay.
GID00011969	Thanks!
GID00011970	Bye.
GID00011971	Thank you!
GID00011972	But... I don't have anything. I thought you were my friend!
GID00011973	Sergeant Teddy!
GID00011974	Like what?
GID00011975	Light armor and machetes only. The challenger - the one who asks to enter the arena - may be pitted against one or more opponents.
GID00011976	All matches continue until one side is dead. No exceptions.
GID00011977	Most of the time it's some young Legionary trying to make a name for himself, hoping to get noticed by Caesar or the Praetorians.
GID00011978	We pit slaves or prisoners against each other once in awhile, but it's not much of a show. They're usually too reluctant to kill each other.
GID00011979	I set up the fights, keep track of prisoners available, and make sure the arena's cleaned up.
GID00011980	Remember the rules: light armor and machetes only. And, of course, to the death.
GID00011981	Good luck.
GID00011982	Very well.
GID00011983	All right. Did you want something else?
GID00011984	Careful in there - he's tougher than he looks.
GID00011985	Watch out for her - she's one of the deadliest fighters I've ever seen.
GID00011986	For sale? I'm a slave, not a merchant. I could give you some healing powder every day, but you'd have to be a friend of the Legion.
GID00011987	For sale? I'm a slave, not a merchant. I could give you some supplies every day, though - you are, after all, a friend of the Legion.
GID00011988	[SUCCEEDED] Oh - I've been using two roots per flower. Thanks to you, I'll be able to create twice as much healing powder per day.
GID00011989	[FAILED] I'd rather not go experimenting. Some of these wasteland plants are toxic.
GID00011990	Was there something else?
GID00011991	Good gracious! The Legion is using the intake tunnels to storm their way into the dam, someone has to stop them.
GID00011992	Caravan companies are probably your best bet. Smaller traders aren't likely to have anything that esoteric.
GID00011993	The clamor of our bloodthirsty crowds reaches every corner of The Wasteland, but I'll pretend that your ignorance doesn't offend me, stranger.
GID00011994	This is The Thorn! Here's where the strong make a name for themselves and the weak are fed to the jaws of hell.
GID00011995	You can bet on the contenders or, if you have what it takes, be one of the contenders.
GID00011996	Be warned, The Thorn demands respect. Break the rules, or offend me in any way, and I'll gut you open for all to see.
GID00011997	So long, stranger.
GID00011998	Good work, stranger. The Thorn will nurture these eggs until their hatchlings are ready to bleed for us.
GID00011999	Here's a compensation for your service. I trust that we're in agreement over it.
GID00012000	Good work, stranger. The Thorn will nurture these eggs until their hatchlings are ready to bleed for us.
GID00012001	Here's a compensation for your service. I trust that we're in agreement over it.
GID00012002	You've, indeed, become the greatest hunter The Thorn has ever seen, the best I've ever seen.
GID00012003	You've earned the honor of being part of this sacred ground. Come to me often and I'll share with you the wealth of The Thorn.
GID00012004	What do you want to know?
GID00012005	Ask and you might get an answer.
GID00012006	What's on your mind?
GID00012007	Good work, stranger. The Thorn will nurture these eggs until their hatchlings are ready to bleed for us.
GID00012008	Here's a compensation for your service. I trust that we're in agreement over it.
GID00012009	We've got a pair of Giant Mantises ready to bleed.
GID00012010	Radscorpions. The crowd loves those.
GID00012011	We're lucky to have some Cazadores in the next match.
GID00012012	Giant Radscorpions are about to battle in The Thorn.
GID00012013	Deadly NightStalkers will now fight for our pleasure.
GID00012014	The strongest Geckos you'll ever see are ready to fight.
GID00012015	The deadliest beast of all! You've never seen anything like this before.
GID00012016	Deathclaws will bleed this sacred ground red! Make your bets, stranger, before it's too late.
GID00012017	Fiend prisoners will fight for their lives against Night Stalkers.
GID00012018	Radscorpions against Fiends.
GID00012019	We've got three fiends ready for our Cazadores.
GID00012020	A rare fight, Deathclaw against Fire Geckos.
GID00012021	Giant Radscorpions against two Deathclaws.
GID00012022	Even if I trusted you I'd not share my secrets just for your pretty face, stranger.
GID00012023	The Thorn's a sacred ground, a source of awe. Here we truly rule over the forces of nature, for once.
GID00012024	These beasts are slaves to their instincts and hunger for blood. That's good enough an answer for everyone, and it'll do for you too.
GID00012025	These beasts are slaves to their instincts and hunger for blood. That's good enough an answer for everyone, and it'll do for you too.
GID00012026	And I won't stop you, stranger.
GID00012027	What's the name of your deathwish?
GID00012028	Let's test your mettle.
GID00012029	On how many can you take, stranger?
GID00012030	Let's see what you've got.
GID00012031	On how many can you take, stranger?
GID00012032	My deadly Cazadores will test your limits.
GID00012033	On how many can you take, stranger?
GID00012034	Be warned, my Geckos are the toughest you'll ever face.
GID00012035	On how many can you take, stranger?
GID00012036	Now you're talking! I'll be impressed if you make it out alive, stranger.
GID00012037	Having seen what you're capable of, I think you'd fight a horde of them and not bat an eye.
GID00012038	But The Thorn honors balance, not foolish sacrifice. I'll only allow one Deathclaw against you.
GID00012039	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
GID00012040	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
GID00012041	I'm listening.
GID00012042	You've got yourself a deal.
GID00012043	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
GID00012044	Confident, I like that.
GID00012045	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
GID00012046	The crowd loves your bravery.
GID00012047	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
GID00012048	Good work, stranger. The Thorn will nurture these eggs until their hatchlings are ready to bleed for us.
GID00012049	Here's a compensation for your service. I trust that we're in agreement over it.
GID00012050	You've got yourself a deal.
GID00012051	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
GID00012052	Confident, I like that.
GID00012053	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
GID00012054	The crowd loves your bravery.
GID00012055	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
GID00012056	You've got yourself a deal.
GID00012057	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
GID00012058	Confident, I like that.
GID00012059	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
GID00012060	The crowd loves your bravery.
GID00012061	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
GID00012062	The rules are simple. My creatures fight for our pleasure. You can bet on a contender and earn double if you chose the victor.
GID00012063	But you can get a bigger share if you risk your skin in The Thorn. Win a fight and I'll give you a meaty cut of the earnings.
GID00012064	I won't tolerate anyone that interferes with the fights. Offend me, and your blood will be the next to spill. Other than that, anything goes.
GID00012065	Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
GID00012066	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
GID00012067	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
GID00012068	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
GID00012069	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
GID00012070	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
GID00012071	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
GID00012072	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
GID00012073	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
GID00012074	Giant Radscorpions make deadly opponents.
GID00012075	On how many can you take?
GID00012076	You've got yourself a deal.
GID00012077	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
GID00012078	Confident, I like that.
GID00012079	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
GID00012080	The crowd loves your bravery.
GID00012081	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
GID00012082	You've proven yourself, stranger. Your blood hungers for glory and I'll placate its thirst.
GID00012083	Name your challenge.
GID00012084	You've got yourself a deal.
GID00012085	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
GID00012086	Confident, I like that.
GID00012087	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
GID00012088	The crowd loves your bravery.
GID00012089	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
GID00012090	Prepare yourself, these Night Stalkers are hungry for blood.
GID00012091	On how many can you take, stranger?
GID00012092	You've got yourself a deal.
GID00012093	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
GID00012094	Confident, I like that.
GID00012095	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
GID00012096	The crowd loves your bravery.
GID00012097	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
GID00012098	You are paying for it. What'll bleed today in The Thorn, stranger?
GID00012099	My creatures are expensive to find, expensive to raise, and expensive to maintain.
GID00012100	If your pleasure is to see them bleed at your will, I'll oblige only after my costs are covered, stranger.
GID00012101	Those costs will change depending on your choice of fighters. Also, I'll only allow fair fights in The Thorn.
GID00012102	I'll help you set up good matches. You pay, you bet, and I bring you the most delightful spectacle on this world. Are we clear?
GID00012103	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.

GID00012202	It ain't like we came to Nipton to play it! Me and my crew had it worked out to kidnap some NCR troopers who come to town to get laid.
GID00012203	Had it all worked out with the scumbag mayor. We were gonna ransom them off, keep their weapons for ourselves, a nice score.
GID00012204	They must have run straight back to camp. I bet they didn't even stop and say thanks.
GID00012205	The NCR could use someone like you. Stop by our camps if you're looking for work.
GID00012206	Can you hurry? I know those Legion bastards are tough but my friends won't last long with all the radiation in there.
GID00012207	Were? What do you mean were?
GID00012208	Legion bastards. They'll pay for that.
GID00012209	I was worried Alexus had already thrown them down a mineshaft. I'll run by camp and see how they're doing when I get a chance. Thanks for the help.
GID00012210	What? Why on earth would you think you can walk in here and make troop deployment recommendations to me?
GID00012211	I appreciate your concern for Bitter Springs. You've already been quite helpful to the NCR, I suppose it's only right to return the favor.
GID00012212	Well, you have been a great help here, and with the saboteur dealt with... Yes, I think we can spare a few men. Consider it done.
GID00012213	Who the hell are you, coming in here and asking me if I can "spare any?" I don't hand out NCR troopers to anybody who wanders out of the Wasteland!
GID00012214	Hey, you're a damn fine soldier, and word on the grapevine is that you're already some kind of hero. You got yourself a deal.
GID00012215	After what you did getting my misfits whipped into shape? Yeah, I can spare a couple of boys for Bitter Springs. I'll issue the dispatch orders.
GID00012216	Sorry, I'm not in the habit of letting random civilians dictate my troop deployment schedule.
GID00012217	I'll be honest, the Legion has me worried here, but I think I can spare some soldiers. Consider your request granted.
GID00012218	You handled yourself well against the Legion, and that took some of the pressure off of us. I'll send a couple of troops out there right now.
GID00012219	Well, keep those eyes up and turning - or I'll set 'em spinning.
GID00012220	Got no time for gawkers... or anyone looking for something I ain't selling.
GID00012221	Your business, huh? Now there's a store worth tending.
GID00012222	You run along now... judging by that busted pilot light expression you're fixed with, "business" ain't so good.
GID00012223	Got no time or answers for you. Ask a drifter in need of a few caps, they'll give you all the answers you need.
GID00012224	This is the place. We got sent from Camp Golf, looking for some Khans who'd been making trouble with one of our settlements.
GID00012225	I guess one of the settlers was connected, because we sent everything we had. We figured this was a gang hideout, but... they'd led us to their home.
GID00012226	There's a ridge called Coyote Tail on the south side. That's where we set up.
GID00012227	Christ. They put the graveyard here.
GID00012228	Canyon 37. That's what the NCR calls the pass down there.
GID00012229	It was the Khans' only escape, so we set up here to guard it while the main force attacked from the front.
GID00012230	Standing orders were to shoot on sight.
GID00012231	Yeah. Always. Even when I sleep.
GID00012232	I don't think so. It won't change anything. And that's a memory I don't want refreshed.
GID00012233	Nothing. Dream. Just tired of thinking about it.
GID00012234	I hope this isn't a mistake.
GID00012235	Yeah. Yeah, I guess not. Forget I brought it up.
GID00012236	You're the one who suggested it.
GID00012237	Fine. If I'm on my own I'm on my own. But I'm gonna go.
GID00012238	Good working with you.
GID00012239	All right. Let's head out, then.
GID00012240	In trade for what?
GID00012241	What do you want to trade for?
GID00012242	How many tags worth?
GID00012243	What type of ammo?
GID00012244	Firearms of what kind?
GID00012245	What sort of armor?
GID00012246	Grecks is a bit cracked, but mostly harmless. Just don't mention anything about his lazy eye.
GID00012247	He owes 138 caps and should still be around Freeside.
GID00012248	Lady Jane fancies herself a high roller, but she's just another dirtbag NCR prospector. I'm not sure where to find her.
GID00012249	I hear she's run goods for the Followers of the Apocalypse in the past, but other locals might know more. She owes us 250 caps.
GID00012250	Santiago is a suave son of a bitch, but a total pansy when it comes to fisticuffs. He owes 212 caps and should be around Freeside as well.
GID00012251	Anything else you need?
GID00012252	I don't know. The NCR's stretched thin as it is. I've put in requests at Camp Golf, Forlorn Hope, McCarran - but things are no better there.
GID00012253	Maybe if their situations improved, they'd have men to spare. Or maybe they'd listen to someone with a reputation for helping the NCR.
GID00012254	Food, blankets, clothes, tools. The army used to ship out caches of supplies regularly, but with the Legion so active we haven't gotten any in months.
GID00012255	You'll want to talk to Lieutenant Markland about that, he's our medical officer. He should be down at the medical tent now.
GID00012256	It started about six months ago. At first it was just supplies going missing - we figured it was refugees. Then people started dying.
GID00012257	Always a single bullet to the head, always from extreme range. We've lost eight refugees and three soldiers to this son of a bitch.
GID00012258	We know he must be hiding out in one of the caves up in the mountains, but I don't have enough men to send out looking for him!
GID00012259	Okay, but make it quick - I'm very busy here.
GID00012260	The Legion happened. What the fuck's it look like?
GID00012261	Luck, that's how! I'm just that fucking lucky!
GID00012262	You're looking at the second place winner of the Nipton lottery! That asshole Swanick took first place, so him they let walk!
GID00012263	I dunno, I just love it here. What the fuck do you think, asshole?
GID00012264	Prize for second place was I got to live, but they beat my fucking legs with hammers. I'm fucking crippled, get it?
GID00012265	Where did you get these? You know what, it doesn't even matter. Thank you. These will be a tremendous help.
GID00012266	Where did you get this? You know what, it doesn't even matter. It doesn't completely solve our problems, but it goes a long way.
GID00012267	Again, thank you, this is a huge help.
GID00012268	I'm an Army field medic. I can treat bullet wounds, shrapnel, trenchfoot, no problem.
GID00012269	But this - the kids and the psychological trauma and all the rest - is out of my league.
GID00012270	Thank you. Any help you can give would be a godsend.
GID00012271	Yeah? Hey, sure, that would be fantastic!
GID00012272	Where did you get this? You know what, it doesn't even matter. Thank you. This will be a tremendous help.
GID00012273	[SUCCEEDED] We do have some spare Rad-X in the supply tent. That might work. Thank you.
GID00012274	[FAILED] You know, I appreciate the help but... we'll pass on those. Thanks.
GID00012275	Well enough. Be on your way.
GID00012276	Of course I'm aware. It's a distress call. This camp is in bad shape, and if we don't get relief soon, I don't know what will happen.
GID00012277	It's a distress call. This camp is in bad shape, and if we don't get relief soon, I don't know what will happen.
GID00012278	Hey, if you can help, I'll take whatever I can get. Doctor's Bags would be a huge help, but what I really need are medical texts.
GID00012279	I'm not trained to deal with major psychological trauma, and we've got a lot of kids in this camp.
GID00012280	What I really need are medical texts - books on psychology or pediatrics, specifically.
GID00012281	What I really need is a book on psychology. Something for post-traumatic stress.
GID00012282	What I really need is a book on pediatric medicine. We've got a lot of sick and injured kids here.
GID00012283	Doctor's bags would be a huge help, but what I really need are medical texts.
GID00012284	I'm not trained to deal with major psychological trauma, and we've got a lot of kids in this camp.
GID00012285	Both of them? Wow, that's very resourceful. Thank you.
GID00012286	That's great! Thank you. I'm sure this will go a long way toward making things better here.
GID00012287	This is exactly the kind of thing I was looking for. Thank you.
GID00012288	At this point, I'll take anything you can give me. We need more troops, fresh supplies, and medical relief.
GID00012289	As if that wasn't enough, someone's been coming out of the mountains at night, stealing supplies and picking off my people.
GID00012290	At this point, I'll take anything you can give me. We need more troops, fresh supplies, and medical relief.
GID00012291	Someone's been coming out of the mountains at night, stealing supplies and picking off my people.
GID00012292	This is the Bitter Springs refugee camp. We've been maintaining it for a few years now, ever since Caesar's Legion started seriously pushing west.
GID00012293	Most of the people here were displaced by the Legion's advance. At first there weren't many, but lately it's been more than we can handle.
GID00012294	Thanks to your help, I think Bitter Springs has a real shot at surviving. I can't offer you much of a reward, but know that the NCR is very grateful.
GID00012295	Thanks to your help, I think Bitter Springs has a real shot at surviving. Thank you again.
GID00012296	Yeah. What they do to women... that's worse than death. There was no choice in what I did.
GID00012297	It was more like... being forced to watch something you can't stop.
GID00012298	All this was only ever going to play out one way. It still is. I don't have any say. All I can do is wait for it to be done with me.
GID00012299	There was never any saving her. They'd have taken her where I couldn't follow. What I did... that was the only rescue.
GID00012300	There was no decision. I was meant to pull that trigger. It was a mistake to think I could escape it.
GID00012301	You take out a debt, it's only a matter of time before someone comes collecting. Things just finally caught up with me.
GID00012302	It was gonna be something. If I'd never met Carla, it would've been something else. I should've never gotten close to her.
GID00012303	I've got bad things coming to me. You'd better keep your distance, too.
GID00012304	Because fair is fair.
GID00012305	Better that you don't.
GID00012306	All right.
GID00012307	No. Sorry.
GID00012308	I was in a lot of places with First Recon. I don't really remember.
GID00012309	That part of my life is over now. So is this discussion.
GID00012310	We won.
GID00012311	There was a... miscommunication.
GID00012312	Look, we've done some traveling together, but we're not exactly comrades-in-arms. I'm not ready to swap war stories.
GID00012313	Maybe some other time.
GID00012314	Your enemies, or mine?
GID00012315	True. It's a start.
GID00012316	I don't know. Couldn't hurt.
GID00012317	Yeah. I guess that'd be the word.
GID00012318	We did what we were there to do. Lot of people got killed. That's war.
GID00012319	Maybe looking back you'd do things differently, but that's not how it works.
GID00012320	In the field, you hesitate, you or someone you care about will die. They teach that from day one.
GID00012321	Yeah, well. That's how they wrote it up in the report.
GID00012322	Not as much as you'd think.
GID00012323	You don't come out of a tour of duty without regrets. It's best just not to think about it.
GID00012324	It doesn't lead anywhere that does any good. I know that much.
GID00012325	Not much hope either way, is there?
GID00012326	Life has a way of punishing you for the mistakes you make.
GID00012327	Big enough mistake, punishment can take a while.
GID00012328	Mine's not over.
GID00012329	A murderer who does good deeds is still a murderer. And he'll still get his judgment.
GID00012330	I left the NCR when my tour was up. Had enough of war. Decided I was gonna start over.
GID00012331	None of it made a difference in the end.
GID00012332	That's what they tell you in the casinos, too. Because it's the only way to get you to buy back in.
GID00012333	If people knew the truth, that something's watching you, waiting to take it all away from you, and it never loses...
GID00012334	That's all it's doing now. Waiting for me to buy back in.
GID00012335	Yeah, that's what I thought, too.
GID00012336	But it's not so easy when you know it's coming for you.
GID00012337	Because I'm still alive.
GID00012338	I heard, we'll be needing those guns. Word on the street is you handled those Fiend freaks like a real pro.
GID00012339	Yeah, I heard. I wasn't sold on the whole gas thing. He's the expert though. It sounds like this chlorine thing is going to work out real well.
GID00012340	I heard you did some good work for us. Thank you. Here's a little cash from us to you. Try not to spend it all in one place.
GID00012341	How do you know? Did you find proof?
GID00012342	Those sick bastards - can't say I'll shed any tears for them. Here, you've earned this.
GID00012343	All right. Maybe Dermot's got something, as well.
GID00012344	All right. Maybe Saint James has something connected to the refugees as well.
GID00012345	We know there's a connection with the refugees, but we need to know where they could be found. There could be more evidence in Dermot's room.
GID00012346	We need a direct connection to the refugees, now that we've got an idea of what happened to them. Saint James could have something in his room.
GID00012347	Let's see... a bear. Yes, this belonged to the little girl, so that's a direct connection to the missing people.
GID00012348	And this ledger - I know these names. Nephi and Cook are major players with the Fiends. Dermot and Saint James must be working with them.
GID00012349	Thank you for your help - I'll make sure those sick bastards get what's coming to them. Here, you've earned this.
GID00012350	You got no right asking me that. Drop it.
GID00012351	That goes both ways. I joined up with you to kill legionaries. Sooner we get back to that, sooner we can have an understanding.
GID00012352	You don't know what you're asking. Just... let it go for now.
GID00012353	The Legion's the only thing I want on my mind right now.
GID00012354	It's just something I'm not ready to discuss. With you or anybody.
GID00012355	I don't see what this helps. She's dead.
GID00012356	Fine. How do I know she's dead? Here it is.
GID00012357	She... I tracked her down. Southeast, near the river. They were selling her. Saw it through my scope.
GID00012358	Whole place swarming with Legion. Hundreds of them. Bidding for things no man has a right to.
GID00012359	I just had my rifle with me. Just me, against all of them, so... I took the shot.
GID00012360	All right.
GID00012361	Yeah, fuck off.
GID00012362	Yeah, well, I must've heard rumors, and, uh... fuck you! You got nothing on me and Dermot.
GID00012363	The killing of Profligates should never go unrewarded. I'll pay you a small sum per tag.
GID00012364	[SUCCEEDED] Go see Decanus Severus when you have tags, in that case. He watches over our stores.
GID00012365	[FAILED] Nothing on this Earth could make you worthy to wear the armor of a Centurion. Do not ask again.
GID00012366	Yes, stop wasting my time.
GID00012367	Killing one Profligate is the work of a child.
GID00012368	Just two?
GID00012369	So you're getting some exercise.
GID00012370	A good bit of hunting. Here's your payment.
GID00012371	Hardly a day's work, but then again, you're not Legion.
GID00012372	Was there something else you wanted to bother me with?
GID00012373	The trip will take a few hours. Take your place on the boat.
GID00012374	That bad huh? Well at least I tried. The actual idea is better. It's a Legion hunt. Whoever kills the most wins. How about it?
GID00012375	Straight to the point. I like that. What I propose is a Legion hunt. Troopers kill them anyway so why not make it a game. What do you say?
GID00012376	Alright fine. Is there anything you do care about?
GID00012377	Alright calm down buddy. I don't wanna provoke you. I'll let you ask the questions.
GID00012378	Yeah it was bad. I'll leave the comedy alone. So how about it?
GID00012379	Yep. Been waiting for a chance to use it. So can I count you in?
GID00012380	Great! Don't be surprised if you're already last when you return. If I'm right, the troopers will use any excuse to slaughter Legion scum.
GID00012381	Can I help you with anything else?
GID00012382	That's a shame. Well if you change your mind, let me know. Need anything else?
GID00012383	Well don't let me stop you then.
GID00012384	Know what? I'm going to sign you up anyway. If you don't mind being last then there's not much else I can say. Any questions?
GID00012385	[SUCCEEDED] Yeah, well, you see anybody wearing Legion crimson or a lot of sports equipment, you just let me know.
GID00012386	You still haven't answered my question.
GID00012387	[FAILED] Drop it. Now why the hell are you here?
GID00012388	You sure you want it to go down this way? You're going to have every Omerta in this place jumping down your throat.
GID00012389	All right, this is going to be fun.
GID00012390	Sorry, we don't have any hotel rooms available right now, but feel free to gamble or help yourself to our other services.
GID00012391	Sorry, we don't have any hotel rooms available right now, but feel free to gamble or help yourself to our other services.
GID00012392	Feel free to head to our club, Brimstone, or you can see our gorgeous courtyard out behind the casino.
GID00012393	Feel free to head to our club, Brimstone, or you can see our gorgeous courtyard out behind the casino.
GID00012394	The fuck? I knew there had to be someone higher up helping you. Nero, you backstabbing, two-timing motherfucker. I knew this day would come.
GID00012395	It's a long story. Let's just say whiskey makes you do strange things to impress a girl.
GID00012396	But it also leads to some of my best competition ideas. Wanna hear one?
GID00012397	Goodbye.
GID00012398	I haven't the time to speak to commoners such as yourself.
GID00012399	Where would I go? My caravan is lost and I haven't the caps to do much else.
GID00012400	Great. I'll have the medical supplies for you by the time you come back.
GID00012401	Here, take this packet sniffer. It will allow us to intercept data on Mr. House's network.
GID00012402	You might have to manually remove the encryption from his data network, but hopefully you won't have too much trouble. Good luck!
GID00012403	I'm afraid that's all I can offer. Well, I won't keep you any longer.
GID00012404	Let me know if you change your mind. The offer for medical supplies will still be good.
GID00012405	Ask away.
GID00012406	Do you mind if I ask why?
GID00012407	Well... I guess that makes some sense. After all, you're the first person who's set foot in there in over two hundred years.
GID00012408	Let me know if you change your mind. I'll be around here or in Vault 21.
GID00012409	Great. You and every other asshole around here. If you grow a heart anytime soon, I'll be around.
GID00012410	Oh... okay. I'll be around if you change your mind.
GID00012411	[SUCCEEDED] Ah. I see. I suppose I can give you some medical supplies for your efforts. I assure you they will be worth plenty of caps.
GID00012412	[FAILED] Oh. No that wasn't really what we had in mind. We were hoping you would just, you know, help us. To be helpful.
GID00012413	Um... I help take care of the Brahmin. I sometimes bring water and food to people. Um... that's it.
GID00012414	Go.
GID00012415	Seek Caesar by way of Cottonwood Cove, south of Nelson. The Cursor Lucullus will be waiting.
GID00012416	Nope, strictly independent. Well... kind of independent.
GID00012417	To vend anything here on the Strip, you got to register with one of those police robots and sign a franchisee agreement.
GID00012418	At the end of each day, you keep half of what you made. The rest, you hand over to those bots - and they know if you're cheating.
GID00012419	Yep, he makes the rules. It's steep, but it sure beats living in North Vegas. Here on the Strip I can afford to eat, and no one tries to kill me.
GID00012420	Best booze in Vegas, baby. What'll it be?
GID00012421	Suit yourself. Gambling's thirsty work - I'll be here if you change your mind.
GID00012422	What starts in misery tends to stay there. Freeside wasn't Freeside until six or seven years ago.
GID00012423	That's when Mr. House's robots rolled out of the Lucky 38 and started pushing everyone who wouldn't join him off the Strip.
GID00012424	Lots of folks died. Some scattered to the winds. The rest wound up in Freeside and seem never to lose the habit of living like refugees.
GID00012425	What about them? Pretty much the sort of gang you'd find anywhere else, just with better clothes.
GID00012426	The King himself, though? He's got that something special you can't put a finger on. Too bad he likes girls with skin.
GID00012427	What did you want to know?
GID00012428	I reckon they care about getting water and electricity from the dam, and that's where it ends.
GID00012429	The locals here are just an inconvenience to them, something to step over or stomp down. They're here for the resources, plain and simple.
GID00012430	Before or after the human race shot itself in the foot? I been around long enough to have both opinions, see.
GID00012431	Before the war, Mr. House was a famous captain of industry - robotics, to be specific. Seemed charming in interviews, until he became a recluse.
GID00012432	Since the war, though? Didn't make a peep for near two hundred years - but when he came back, he came back strong and killed a lot of people.
GID00012433	I don't know how they do it. They're like saints, those Followers.
GID00012434	If they didn't charge for their services, I'd think they was crazy. But no, they're just naive. Warms your heart.
GID00012435	A couple of Radscorpions, those two. Gloria is the stable one, but she'd slit your throat if there's a profit in it.
GID00012436	Or rather she'd tell her brother to do it for her. Jean Baptiste is one of the sicker humans I've had the displeasure of observing.
GID00012437	I've escorted my share of idiot tourists around Freeside. Too much trouble for what it pays.
GID00012438	I'm all boot knives and leather, friend - and a ghoul, besides. What kind of weirdo wants what I've got?
GID00012439	Weirdos into bullwhips and necrosis, eh? Doesn't sound half-bad...
GID00012440	What am I thinking? I'm no whore, and I ain't about to hand my ass over to some penny-ante hustler like he owns me.
GID00012441	[SUCCEEDED] Hmm. They do have a damn good selection of hooch over at the Wrangler.
GID00012442	If I get to choose my customers, if I get to be a little rough with them, if my cut is fair, and if I get that discount? That just might work.
GID00012443	Tell the Garrets I'll stop by to work out terms.
GID00012444	[FAILED] Take your best shot, sweetheart. That's all the action I need.
GID00012445	Then, what do you want?
GID00012446	What's the difference?! Once you start working for the man, you gotta buy nice things to wear.
GID00012447	Then, you gotta make more money to afford the nice things. Seems like a right vicious cycle to get into.
GID00012448	Not saying there wouldn't be advantages, especially if it'd let me start saving up my caps...
GID00012449	Absinthe?! I haven't had a taste of that in decades!
GID00012450	If they keep bottles stocked at the Wrangler, you can count me in. I'll head that way and talk to Mr. Garret.
GID00012451	Goodbye.
GID00012452	Please, find them soon. I can already feel the withdrawal effects taking hold.
GID00012453	Goodbye.
GID00012454	Sure. Just tell me the author and what you want it to say.
GID00012455	Not a problem. I occasionally do business with the Van Graffs, so I have a sample of Mr. Cutting's handwriting around here somewhere.
GID00012456	What would you like it to say?
GID00012457	Like to live dangerously, do we? No problem. And... here you go.
GID00012458	This is important enough to the Followers that we scraped together the caps required for the credit check.
GID00012459	And I'm staying at Vault 21, which is pretty cheap. For the Strip, anyway.
GID00012460	I understand.
GID00012461	Just doing my job, okay? Jeesh.
GID00012462	Like he helped the envoy we sent? No thanks.
GID00012463	It's not something I'm willing to discuss. Now if you'll excuse me, there are other people waiting.
GID00012464	You won't regret it. At least until an hour or so from now.
GID00012465	You'll be back.
GID00012466	Typically, I find it goes down better if I leave people guessing. So what do you say, want some?
GID00012467	Only a little. A friend of mine, Major Elizabeth Kieran, has been handing out supplies to the poor a little west of here. What about it?
GID00012468	I know something's got them riled up, but I've been too busy with other matters to really look into it.
GID00012469	If you're looking into the matter, talk to Elizabeth. She's in charge of the operations here in Freeside, though she won't open up to you right away.
GID00012470	If Elizabeth holds out on you, tell her that I sent you. She should be a little more forthcoming if you mention my name.
GID00012471	Was there anything else you wanted to talk about?
GID00012472	Okay, what did you want to talk about?
GID00012473	Good. I like that enthusiasm. Return when you have some information we can use.
GID00012474	Good. Return here when you've found something.
GID00012475	Bunch of soldier boys, huh? They usually don't come around these parts since their big base is on the other side of the Strip.
GID00012476	If they're comin' over here now, it's got to be for a reason. I didn't want to believe the rumors that they're looking to take over Vegas, but now...
GID00012477	If something big is going down, I'm sure rumors of it will have spread. Ask around, particularly in the squatter areas where the NCR folk hang.
GID00012478	You might also mosey on over to the Mormon Fort and chat Julie Farkas up. The Followers tend to be in the know about these things.
GID00012479	Just don't ask her what to do about it. She'll probably ask you to hug someone or somethin'.
GID00012480	Then there's no sense in us talkin' about it.
GID00012481	Go ahead. Throw some questions at me.
GID00012482	Ah, that would explain the goons. They're here to keep people like my friends away from the food. That ain't something I support. No sir.
GID00012483	Keep at it. Those boys are here for a reason.
GID00012484	Sure can. What did you want to know?
GID00012485	Nothing's innocent in Freeside. You should know that by now.
GID00012486	No, I'm guessing they're doing something they know will cause a row, like keep the food all to themselves.
GID00012487	Ah, that would explain the goons. They're here to keep people like my friends away from the food. That ain't something I support. No sir.
GID00012488	I'm gonna see that those supplies are distributed a little m- what the hell?
GID00012489	Wait a minute, wait a minute. They said what?
GID00012490	Don't worry, I'm not gonna do anything uncalled for.
GID00012491	Huh, that would explain why they're all riled at us. Seems like we have a big misunderst- what the hell?
GID00012492	What is that fool doing? I need you to head out there and try to defuse the situation. Tell them I'm willing to cooperate.
GID00012493	You there! Keep your hands where we can see them! Draw a weapon and we will fire!
GID00012494	Put your weapon away or we will fire!
GID00012495	Here comes a winner. I'll let you handle this one.
GID00012496	Settle in. You've got some hours left before your shift ends.
GID00012497	Heck Gunderson, you are under arrest for the murder of Ted Gunderson.
GID00012498	What in blazes? That's my son you're talking about! He ain't dead. I'm looking for him.
GID00012499	It is my duty to inform you that murder is a serious crime.
GID00012500	As a murderer you should be feeling emotions such as guilt, sorrow, and shame.
GID00012501	If not, you may wish to consult a mental health professional.
GID00012502	Where's my son? What'd you do with my boy?
GID00012503	I hope this experience has taught you an important lesson about the value of human life.
GID00012504	You can't do this to me! This is a mistake!
GID00012505	Dead or alive, you're coming with me.
GID00012506	Please allow me to escort you to the nearest criminal processing facility.
GID00012507	The hell I will.
GID00012508	Stand back, citizens. Deceased bodies are a known source of illness, and a potential tripping hazard.
GID00012509	Wonderful. You have come through with flying colors. On behalf of my colleagues, allow me to extend my thanks.
GID00012510	I know what a terrible sacrifice this must've been for you.
GID00012511	King, we've got problems!
GID00012512	Lay it on me. What's going on?
GID00012513	There's a shootout going down near the train station. It's Pacer and some strangers. Might be NCR.
GID00012514	Hey there, I heard that NCR soldier lady told you some wild story about them sending a messenger to us to work out some deal.
GID00012515	That's bullshit, and it's nothing to bother the King with. More like they sent someone to spy on us and he wasn't tough enough to last in Freeside.
GID00012516	So do everyone a favor and keep your mouth shut about it, okay?
GID00012517	It's no problem, just something I'd rather not think about. Now, I should get to the other customers.
GID00012518	No, I'm afraid we don't. Do you have a friend you wanted to bring in?
GID00012519	Like I said before, we don't. And I'm not inclined to discuss why.
GID00012520	You were right, but here, take another helping for your friend. It'll be our secret.
GID00012521	Well, now you know. Enjoy the food.
GID00012522	That's not really a pleasant topic of conversation. Let's just say we have our reasons.
GID00012523	You know Julie? Not everyone in the NCR sees eye-to-eye with the Followers, but they're okay in my book, mostly because of her.
GID00012524	If you really want to know, we sent an envoy to the King offering to coordinate the relief effort.
GID00012525	In a manner of speaking. Our envoy was brutally beaten, and only barely survived. My superiors ordered the relief mission scrapped.
GID00012526	I managed to get clearance to carry out the mission anyway, but with greatly reduced support.
GID00012527	Now there's not enough supplies to go around even if I wanted to serve the rest of Freeside, which I don't.
GID00012528	But that's all in the past now. I should get back to work. Say hi to Julie for me.
GID00012529	Our envoy was brutally beaten, and only barely survived. My superiors ordered the relief mission scrapped.
GID00012530	The man was brutally beaten, and only barely survived. My superiors ordered the relief mission scrapped.
GID00012531	Wh-? Guards!
GID00012532	Then he should watch his back. We know for a fact that the envoy made it to their headquarters.
GID00012533	Still, if the King's willing to deal with us, perhaps we can work something out. I'll tell my men to stand down.
GID00012534	You're a bastard after my own heart. Here, this should do it.
GID00012535	[SUCCEEDED] Fine, here's some more, but you better keep you mouth shut! I'm out of here. Got some important business to take care of.
GID00012536	[FAILED] That's all you get. Now keep your mouth shut. Now if you'll pardon me, I got some important business to take care of.
GID00012537	Good, see that it stays that way. Now if you'll pardon me, I got some important business to take care of.
GID00012538	That's a shame. Well, do what you want. Just don't expect it to matter.
GID00012539	Exactly. Seeing that we're of one mind on this, I'll head out. I got business to take care of.
GID00012540	Why you lit- You're just lucky I got something important to take care of. We'll settle this later.
GID00012541	Sorry, but I can't tell you that. Trade secret.
GID00012542	He's the reason the Strip shines like a star at night. Mike's imagined and built every sign, billboard and light you'll see around here.
GID00012543	Then go bother someone else. I got shit to do.
GID00012544	Yeah, you can blame Glory for that mess. She had some fun with the little prick and it ended badly.
GID00012545	Now he goes around spreading lies about my sister, which pisses me off. One of these days I'm going to piss in his skull, you watch.
GID00012546	Ha, he's a jet junkie? He'll go crazy when he finds it gone. I like it.
GID00012547	I'll tell you what. When you hit the stash, leave him this note from me. If the punk really has it bad, he'll come running straight here.
GID00012548	His gang won't be able to say shit if he comes storming this place himself.
GID00012549	We could do that, but then we'd have to kill his four hundred friends too, and that'd just get tiring.
GID00012550	Some day he'll make a mistake, though, and his friends won't be around to back him up, and then he'll be mine.
GID00012551	Our family comes from Redding, to the west. We deal weapons mostly, but trade other commodities, like gold, if there's cash in it.
GID00012552	Our mother's been running the show for longer than most of us have been alive, but she stays at the home office.
GID00012553	We've got branches all over the place, which are run by my brothers and sisters.
GID00012554	Momma's real popular with the menfolk, both for her money and her looks, which is why there's ten of us kids in total, all by different fathers.
GID00012555	We're a wild bunch. There's my sister Frieda, who used to run this branch but took off to pursue "the opportunity of a lifetime", as she put it.
GID00012556	The rest are all long stories, and I don't got the time to tell them.
GID00012557	I used to be a doctor back in California, but a few years back I got suckered into doing military work because it was my "patriotic duty."
GID00012558	Back then, I, like many idealistic men before me, thought it was a great idea and was excited about making the world a better place with the NCR.
GID00012559	Now... I just want to get back home. I've had enough fighting and fixing up soldiers just to send them right back out to die to last a lifetime.
GID00012560	[SUCCEEDED] Excessive use causes dilated eyes, an increased heart rate and blood pressure, massive sweating, you know... the usual.
GID00012561	[FAILED] Good god, no. Look, don't worry about symptoms, just ask around and see if anyone has noticed anything suspicious.
GID00012562	Quite a bit actually. I was stationed nearby during the first battle of Hoover Dam four years ago. I saw a lot of what happened firsthand.
GID00012563	My take? I try not to think about it, I got enough on my hands here.
GID00012564	The Legion attacked in full force. Chief Hanlon had the troopers fall back pulling the enemy in, before entrenching into secure positions.
GID00012565	The Legion got bogged down and Rangers and 1st Recon sharpshooters started taking out the Legion officers.
GID00012566	They sent their best men to stop the Rangers and 1st Recon, but the Rangers pulled them into a trap at Boulder City and blew them all to hell.
GID00012567	After that the Legion's forces were in disarray and tried to retreat. However, our forces advanced rapidly and routed them. And that was that.
GID00012568	You have no idea. It was a fierce battle. Lots of people died.
GID00012569	Anyone with medical training had their hands full for weeks after the battle was finally over.
GID00012570	During that time I saw quite a few things I wouldn't mind forgetting about.
GID00012571	Okay, what's on your mind?
GID00012572	Alright. What do you want to know?
GID00012573	You're welcome. Enjoy.
GID00012574	I'm not going to argue with you there. Thanks, I appreciate this.
GID00012575	Holy shit! How the hell did you find that?
GID00012576	Look, I can explain everything! Really, just give me a chance to explain!
GID00012577	I do what now? Uhh... I mean, yeah, I sometimes need to... stretch my legs. Helps me... uh... think.
GID00012578	[SUCCEEDED] Well... sometimes I sneak into the medical tent at night and "borrow" some of the medical supplies.
GID00012579	But it's not what you think. I can explain everything. Just hear me out.
GID00012580	[FAILED] Nothing's going on, so just mind your own business.
GID00012581	Yeah, nothing strange about a late night stroll. Everybody does it.
GID00012582	I don't care what you believe. Now unless there's something else, why don't you just buzz off.
GID00012583	No, I didn't. You might hear that kind of nonsense from a drunk trooper on the Strip, but not from me. The Legion doesn't have Super Mutants.
GID00012584	That patrol was wiped out by its own incompetence - a couple of the troopers were fooling around with a grenade when it went off.
GID00012585	Keeping watch on the river and looking for anyone trying to cross it. The Legion likes to send infiltration teams over on rafts.
GID00012586	Maybe. I'd like to know who I'm dealing with, first.
GID00012587	My squad was ambushed by a Legion party lead by that bastard Alexus.
GID00012588	He was taking us into the mine up ahead, but I managed to get away. I need help to get them out.
GID00012589	That's already more than I was expecting. I'll keep watch to make sure no more Legion come up the road. Good Luck.
GID00012590	There's a slim chance. But if the Legion wanted us dead, our heads would already be on pikes.
GID00012591	[SUCCEEDED] I understand. Here's what I have on me. Now go before it's too late.
GID00012592	[FAILED] This is an emergency. How can you be asking for payment?
GID00012593	There's no way I can take on the Legion by myself. I'll be here if you change your mind.
GID00012594	Really? I can't thank you enough. I'll wait here and watch the road. Good luck in there.
GID00012595	That should only take a few seconds if you've got the caps.
GID00012596	There you go. Anything else?
GID00012597	Stitching up lacerations and treating wounds will take some time. I'm going to need caps to get started.
GID00012598	You look fine to me. I hope this isn't drug-seeking behavior... though I've never seen anyone get addicted to Stimpaks.
GID00012599	How have you been using the bathroom with your arms that messed up? Oh, forget I asked... phew.
GID00012600	I'm amazed you managed to limp here with your legs like that.
GID00012601	I didn't think red, purple, and swollen was your natural eye color. I can fix that right up.
GID00012602	Did a super mutant use your torso as a punching bag or something? I'm going to need more gauze...
GID00012603	Okay. This shouldn't take long, but I'm going to need some caps to cover supplies.
GID00012604	You might want to brace yourself. This might get a bit painful.
GID00012605	You might want to brace yourself. This might get a bit painful.
GID00012606	A shot of Med-X for the pain, and you shouldn't feel... well some of what I need to do.
GID00012607	A shot of Med-X for the pain, and you shouldn't feel... well some of what I need to do.
GID00012608	This could take a while. Did you bring caps?
GID00012609	A shot of Med-X for the pain, and you shouldn't feel... well some of what I need to do.
GID00012610	A shot of Med-X for the pain, and you shouldn't feel... well some of what I need to do.
GID00012611	Besides the gratitude of the Legion? Don't worry, you'll be paid in coin or caps.
GID00012612	I prefer to handle these matters through intermediaries such as yourself.
GID00012613	Good. Martina frequents the Vault 21 Gift Shop, on the Strip. Hurry along, and she still may be in one piece by the time you get there.
GID00012614	If you have to. I really don't see what there is to consider.
GID00012615	Made me a special arrangement with the hotel. They want to do business with me, they got to play by my rules.
GID00012616	Lot of people out there resent success, might wanna take a swipe at me. This makes them think twice.
GID00012617	If I'd have been thinking, though, I'd have had him watching my boy instead. Then none of this would've happened.
GID00012618	I don't have that many supplies left, so I can't offer my services freely, but I can help you.
GID00012619	Well, go somewhere else. You're not welcome here.
GID00012620	You look fine to me. Well, as fine as anyone else around here.
GID00012621	I've seen worse, but I should be able to fix you up pretty easily.
GID00012622	Yeah, that looks pretty nasty.
GID00012623	This might take a miracle, and a lot of money.
GID00012624	You and me both, but let's worry about you first. I can fix you up, if you know what I mean.
GID00012625	Sure can. The sooner the better if you ask me, unless you want a third arm.
GID00012626	Sorry. I'm low on supplies as it is and I don't have any to spare.
GID00012627	Okay, now this might hurt a bit...
GID00012628	Well, let me know if you get some money before that third arm comes in.
GID00012629	Your loss, not mine. Let me know if your hair starts falling out.
GID00012630	Thanks, I'll fix you up right away.
GID00012631	If you can't do the time, don't do the crime. Think about that next time you get high.
GID00012632	Good luck to you then, junkie.
GID00012633	Excellent, just let me grab my scalpel and a body bag, and we'll get started.
GID00012634	Well, you'll probably be fine. For a little while, anyway.
GID00012635	Okay then. Just try not to bleed all over the place, okay?
GID00012636	Okay then.
GID00012637	I don't have any supplies to spare, but I've got caps if you have anything you don't need.
GID00012638	I don't have any supplies to spare for someone with your spotted reputation, but buy your stuff for half the going rate.
GID00012639	You have no idea who you're messing with!
GID00012640	[SUCCEEDED] Shit. Look, we're just following orders. We, uh, need to take this up with the boss.
GID00012641	[FAILED] Fuck the Legion. The NCR's got troops between us and them.
GID00012642	Omerta business. Now fuck off, or else.
GID00012643	Deal.
GID00012644	Everything your little heart desires, that's what. You like gambling? Boom. Either one of the main hallways has cards, slots, you name it.
GID00012645	Hungry? Thirsty? The restaurant just off the left-hand hallway has the best food and booze in Vegas.
GID00012646	Or maybe you'd rather take in a show? The Aces Theater upstairs always has hot acts raring to go. Check it out.
GID00012647	Relax, baby, they're safe as houses. We'll keep them locked up in the bank upstairs, right next to the money. It's serious protection.
GID00012648	My orders are to hold Nelson. So far the enemy north of here has been too frightened to move against us. Why should it concern you?
GID00012649	Not all of us have the luxury of coming and going as we please. Here, we stay put.
GID00012650	What stalemate? It is Caesar's will that I hold this position - that I not advance.
GID00012651	If you're so eager to see Camp Forlorn Hope fall, why don't you go attack it all by yourself? Well?
GID00012652	You have license to go where you please, at my will. True to Caesar.
GID00012653	I have attacked the enemy. I led the assault on Nelson with two contubernia against twice our number.
GID00012654	It is Caesar's wish that we hold this position. Our mere presence this side of the Colorado humiliates and demoralizes the enemy.
GID00012655	I do not question Caesar's will! I do not second-guess!
GID00012656	I butchered this town. Those who weren't hacked limb from limb were forced to throw themselves from the cliffs. Three more, I have just crucified.
GID00012657	All this, in full view of the enemy's spotters to the north. Yes, our presence here demoralizes the enemy.
GID00012658	That remains to be seen.
GID00012659	You are not my Centurion! You aren't even Legion! I do not "carry on" at your command.
GID00012660	True to Caesar.
GID00012661	Even if you are Legion, you are not my Centurion! I do not "carry on" at your command.
GID00012662	True to Caesar.
GID00012663	True to Caesar.
GID00012664	True to Caesar.
GID00012665	A vow without action is breath across the lips, nothing more. True to Caesar.
GID00012666	A glorious victory. You must be very satisfied.
GID00012667	I'll send word of your achievement. Perhaps Caesar will see fit to send another contubernium to occupy the Camp.
GID00012668	Here - take this, my blade. It was a gift from my Centurion upon the defeat of the Sun Dog tribe.
GID00012669	Then there's nothing for us to talk about. True to Caesar.
GID00012670	True to Caesar.
GID00012671	That blade has split the heads of... The only reason I give it to you is to force myself to earn another. True to Caesar.
GID00012672	You don't understand. I'll have to distinguish myself in battle to earn another. True to Caesar.
GID00012673	You'll get these back on your way out.
GID00012674	You'll get these back on your way out.
GID00012675	Then get the fuck out of here.
GID00012676	Yes?
GID00012677	Okay, I got clothes I can use for that. When you give the word, I'll let the other girls know and we'll meet you at the lobby.
GID00012678	I'm ready. Just give the word and we'll meet you at the lobby, in an hour.
GID00012679	It's not a good time right now, hon. It's got to be around midnight.
GID00012680	We're ready. Let's get the hell out of here before they recognize us.
GID00012681	Okay. See you soon.
GID00012682	It's now or never, let's go.
GID00012683	Whatever you've got to do, do it quick!
GID00012684	Smooth and easy, just the way I like it. Don't worry, they'll be as safe as kittens till you're ready to leave.
GID00012685	Oh, and a friendly word of advice: if you happen to "stumble across" any weapons during your stay here, well... just don't wear them openly. You dig?
GID00012686	Now that we got that little business out of the way, what can I do to make your Tops experience the tops?
GID00012687	Smooth and easy, just the way I like it. Don't worry, they'll be as safe as kittens till you're ready to leave.
GID00012688	Oh, and a friendly word of advice: if you happen to "stumble across" any weapons during your stay here, well... just don't wear them openly. You dig?
GID00012689	Now that we got that little business out of the way, what can I do to make your Tops experience the tops?
GID00012690	Security, baby. Can't make the bread if the bakers are full of lead, you dig it? Don't worry, you're safe as houses in here, courtesy of Mr. House.
GID00012691	Them's the breaks. You want in, you don't bring the guns.
GID00012692	Buddy, you just made the biggest mistake of your life.
GID00012693	Lady, you just made the biggest mistake of your life.
GID00012694	I've been placed in charge of morale. It's difficult trying to keep spirits up with the Legion nearby.
GID00012695	In fact, there's more hope in wrangling Brahmin with my grandmother's stocking than inspiring these troopers.
GID00012696	Ironic isn't it?
GID00012697	But it's understandable. The constant skirmishes take their toll on everyone in the end.
GID00012698	I'd call that an understatement.
GID00012699	But I can't complain. I'm not in the field as much as the others. I just stay here most of the day coming up with activities to occupy the camp.
GID00012700	Which reminds me of something I've been meaning to try. A killer competition to boost morale. Interested?
GID00012701	Great. Since the camp is threatened by Legion, I propose a hunt. Kill any you encounter and bring me the Legion's ear as proof.
GID00012702	You get it? Legion ear?
GID00012703	Come on. Lend me your ear. I bet you'll be good at it.
GID00012704	Woah boy! This puts you far ahead of everyone else. I think I'll have to declare you the winner of the competition.
GID00012705	It's not much, but here's a little something I scraped together for the winner of the contest. Good job, you earned it.
GID00012706	Oh man! Awesome! The competition is still going strong. Keep it up!
GID00012707	What's on your mind?
GID00012708	No complaints. My assignment isn't easy but it's vital in keeping the troopers going.
GID00012709	In fact I have a new idea I'm confident will help morale. But if I told the troopers, it would likely fall on deaf ears.
GID00012710	I'd have better luck with the Legion's ears. Heh, get it? Legion ears?
GID00012711	Haven't started it yet. Are you interested to hear about it now?
GID00012712	You ready to participate?
GID00012713	About the shortage of Hydra right? We all have our own ways to deal with this place. Me, I sometimes walk at night. Calms the nerves.
GID00012714	I think Private Stone does the same thing.
GID00012715	Great! Don't be surprised if you're already last when you return. If I'm right, the troopers will use any excuse to slaughter Legion scum.
GID00012716	Can I help you with anything else?
GID00012717	Yeah it was a crazy idea. Did you need anything else?
GID00012718	The best it's been since the camp started. All because of you. So thanks, buddy!
GID00012719	It's showing improvement. Troopers aren't showing up late to their posts anymore.
GID00012720	Lower than a Feral Ghoul's IQ.
GID00012721	I sometimes see him wandering around the camp. Though he seems to need more time to himself. His cot's still empty when I return after midnight.
GID00012722	Did you need anything else?
GID00012723	Glad to help.
GID00012724	Okay, what level of care do you require?
GID00012725	You look fine to me. I hope this isn't drug-seeking behavior... though I've never seen anyone get addicted to Stimpaks.
GID00012726	Hey, no one but Omertas are allowed to carry guns into Gomorrah! Check your weapons with me.
GID00012727	Welcome back to Gomorrah. I know you're good for it, but you're still gonna have to leave your weapons with me.
GID00012728	[SUCCEEDED] Very well... five times your delivery bonus - not one cap more.
GID00012729	[FAILED] Is that an attempt at... humor?
GID00012730	I've always taken business negotiations seriously. I advise you to do the same.
GID00012731	You can't - but the Chip can. The hatch will recognize the Platinum Chip and "open sesame."
GID00012732	You'll need a disguise, then. Or overwhelming firepower. Whatever works.
GID00012733	Sorry for the inconvenience, but it can't be helped. This is too important.
GID00012734	Then look harder.
GID00012735	I don't employ you to uncover evidence. This isn't a court of law.
GID00012736	If the Omertas pose a threat to the physical or economic security of the Vegas Strip, I want you to do whatever it takes to neutralize that threat.
GID00012737	Well done. They won't be causing any trouble, then.
GID00012738	The Legion has nothing left to wait for. Their assault on the dam could begin at any moment.
GID00012739	Before that happens, I'll ask you to complete one other task. It may seem trivial, but that's far from the case.
GID00012740	Well done. The Boomers' firepower may prove an advantage when the battle for Hoover Dam comes around.
GID00012741	It seems diplomacy is not your forte.
GID00012742	Given the strength of your past performance, I think we can let this go without further comment. I'm pulling you on to a new assignment.
GID00012743	There's more than one way to skin a cat, as the saying goes. Or went, that is - cats being extinct.
GID00012744	I don't promote political assassination as a first option, but it has a long and storied history. I'll consider the Boomers neutralized.
GID00012745	Singlehandedly destroying a Brotherhood of Steel bunker is quite an accomplishment. Platoons of NCR troops have died, trying to do the same.
GID00012746	This welcome news comes just in time, as events in the wider world are coming to a head...
GID00012747	Not surprising. Also not acceptable.
GID00012748	I didn't ask you to tell me what they were planning, I asked you to kill them. This was a waste of time.
GID00012749	Go back to the bunker and destroy it. My directions have been clear from the start.
GID00012750	This is no time to be droll...
GID00012751	Your "accident" has jeopardized the success of this entire concern.
GID00012752	Up to this point, your efforts yielded near-perfect results. But now I'm forced to fumble in the dark - to gamble.
GID00012753	Light must be brought to this darkness.
GID00012754	Your impulsivity has jeopardized the success of this entire concern!
GID00012755	Your incompetence has jeopardized the success of this entire concern!
GID00012756	Every step of my plan has been precisely calculated and was, until now, well-executed.
GID00012757	I'll be happy to satisfy your every curiosity once the Platinum Chip has been delivered.
GID00012758	This is not the time for Q&A. Kindly hand over the Chip.
GID00012759	Fine - give me the Chip, and I'll pay you four times the delivery bonus stipulated in your contract. How's that?
GID00012760	How do you suggest Santiago does this?
GID00012761	I don't care how you handled those lumps of human refuse, but you got the job done. We need you to hunt down another person.
GID00012762	That son of a bitch, McCaffery, stole a ton of caps and ran off to Vegas. I guess the fact that we farmed out his usual work to you pissed him off.
GID00012763	No one steals from the Garret Twins! If you can kill that bastard and bring back as much as you can, you'll be paid very well.
GID00012764	I don't care how you handled those lumps of human refuse, but you got the job done. For helping us out, we would like to set you up with a room.
GID00012765	You can have the corner room, rent free. It was McCaffery's.
GID00012766	Now that he's dead, we're happy to let you use it. Thanks for helping us.
GID00012767	I don't care how you handled those lumps of human refuse, but you got the job done. We need you to hunt down another person.
GID00012768	That son of a bitch, McCaffery, stole a ton of caps and ran off to Vegas. I guess the fact that we farmed out his usual work to you pissed him off.
GID00012769	No one steals from the Garret Twins! If you can kill that bastard and bring back as much as you can, you'll be paid very well.
GID00012770	I don't care how you handled those lumps of human refuse, but you got the job done. For helping us out, we would like to set you up with a room.
GID00012771	You can have the corner room, rent free. It was McCaffery's.
GID00012772	Now that he's dead, we're happy to let you use it. Thanks for helping us.
GID00012773	I'm sorry, but I can't give you meds for nothing. There are too many people who need these supplies.
GID00012774	Follow me.
GID00012775	Like I always say, a polite society is an armed society.
GID00012776	Caesar has taught us that over-reliance on firearms can only weaken us in the long run. It's why we train heavily with our blades and our fists.
GID00012777	Unlike an NCR trooper, a Legionary is always ready to fight regardless of the circumstance he finds himself in.
GID00012778	We're property. If you're too young or too old, the men usually leave you alone. Usually.
GID00012779	We're property. If you're too young or too old, the men usually leave you alone. Usually.
GID00012780	You ought to be careful, yourself. I overheard some of the Legionaries talking about "trying you out."
GID00012781	I suppose you have a few questions.
GID00012782	Their commander is down! Kill the rest!
GID00012783	I trust you find everything acceptable?
GID00012784	Everything seems to be in order. Caesar will not soon forget this.
GID00012785	No, I imagine he won't.
GID00012786	They're taking an awfully long time inspecting the weapons. I'm beginning to think they're doing it just to unnerve us.
GID00012787	Don't let them rattle you, though. The deal's almost done. There's just one last piece of business left.
GID00012788	Speaking of which, I need you to listen to me very carefully. Things are about to get a little crazy. When I give the signal, follow my lead, okay?
GID00012789	It's a trap! Fall back!
GID00012790	Mmm. Yes. He was none too pleased when he discovered who we took. The boy is in the freezer, back through the kitchen.
GID00012791	The dumpster? That's filthy!
GID00012792	I can't tell you how much that turns me on. Takes me back to my youth when I used to fool around with the help at our estate.
GID00012793	I shouldn't... but... it's been so long. And when is this ever gonna happen to me again? Okay, you're on. Don't keep me waiting, gorgeous.
GID00012794	Yeah? What about?
GID00012795	It's been stiff lately. Since I was attacked I've been afraid to sleep in my bed. I know it's irrational.
GID00012796	Now I can't hardly sleep at all. I just nod off from time to time. I'm so tired.
GID00012797	Oh that feels nice. I can already feel myself rela...
GID00012798	Really? Is that some kind of ancient Chinese secret or something? Well, what the hell. I'll try anything once. Here goes...
GID00012799	Ouch! What the hell? I don't think that did any-
GID00012800	Are they back?
GID00012801	Make it quick.
GID00012802	That obvious, huh? Yeah I'm not from around here. But where I'm from, they don't want me, so that's just as well.
GID00012803	Really with my reputation, there aren't many places I can go that'll have me. My own family's blackballed me, and they've got a lot of clout.
GID00012804	Whatever.
GID00012805	Oh, sure. That's all I need. Someone telling people around here about my reputation. I'll be run out of here before dawn. Forget it.
GID00012806	I've heard of them. Ultra-Luxe, right? Yeah, that'd be a step in the right direction. They'd never have me, though.
GID00012807	Yeah? Okay, maybe I will. Hell, anything's better than this. Thanks.
GID00012808	Splendid, splendid. The boy is being held in the kitchen beneath the Gourmand. Here are some keys that will allow you access to him.
GID00012809	The elder Gunderson is staying in our penthouse. I understand he's hired security, so be careful if you go up there.
GID00012810	And our Mr. St. Clair resides to the north. He rarely strays far from his house, and he's surrounded it with booby traps.
GID00012811	Not this one. Empty. I don't believe it's seen use since before the war.
GID00012812	And what would the point be, really? Who would pick up his trash if he used it?
GID00012813	But for our purposes, it should keep his body safe and hidden until my cohorts can recover it.
GID00012814	Just as I asked. What a magnificent relief! By now, barring any more bungling, my underlings should have him on his way here.
GID00012815	Of his own volition? My goodness, you are very professional, aren't you? Well, he's sure to be a hit at our next banquet.
GID00012816	Drat! He was our best chance at a fresh and healthy entree.
GID00012817	Without a replacement, I'll have to push back the whole affair. I can just see my rivals sneering at me.
GID00012818	What about Joana?
GID00012819	She'll have to go disguised. Gomorrah's packed around midnight and the bouncers won't notice just another patron leaving the joint.
GID00012820	I'll be near the entrance but I need to keep out of sight. The Omertas have contacts, and they're still looking for me.
GID00012821	All right! See you soon.
GID00012822	All right! See you soon.
GID00012823	Dammit! You're going to leave me hanging, uh? Don't know how else I can get her back.
GID00012824	All right! See you soon.
GID00012825	I take care of my debts. How can I repay you, friend?
GID00012826	I take care of my debts. How can I repay you, friend?
GID00012827	Are you leaving... just like that?
GID00012828	Okay, friend, I hope to see you again, far away from this place.
GID00012829	Really, you're one of a kind.
GID00012830	Okay, friend, I hope to see you again, far away from this place.
GID00012831	[SUCCEEDED] We have a deal, then.
GID00012832	Okay, friend, I hope to see you again, far away from this place.
GID00012833	[FAILED] No deal, we agreed on less than that.
GID00012834	Okay, friend, I hope to see you again, far away from this place.
GID00012835	What, you think I can just waltz in there and take her away? She's their doll now, okay?
GID00012836	Besides, I step in Gomorrah and I'm as good as dead, you hear? You don't just leave the Omertas unless it's in a body bag.
GID00012837	Whose doesn't, huh? Look, see Joana safely to Freeside and you'll cash in this favor, big time.
GID00012838	Deal! Come back with news soon, you hear?
GID00012839	No... Joana! It can't be! She didn't deserve this, she didn't, you hear?
GID00012840	It should've been me, not her... They will pay, right now! Out of my way!
GID00012841	What mission, what are you talking about?
GID00012842	Surrender. You don't seriously think that you can take on my crew, do you?
GID00012843	Profit? What sort of profit do you have in mind that would compensate for your lives.
GID00012844	Time to die!
GID00012845	What mission, what are you talking about?
GID00012846	[SUCCEEDED] All the dough!? Cachino once said this traitor flipped with thousands off the record. But, why wasn't I informed?
GID00012847	[SUCCEEDED] I see, yeah... he knows what we usually do to traitors. But all that profit is well worth sparing his miserable life.
GID00012848	Okay, carry on. And, we've never been here, you understand? Boss doesn't need to know about this.
GID00012849	[FAILED] You think me a fool? We wouldn't hire an outsider to deal with a traitor.
GID00012850	Time to die!
GID00012851	[FAILED] You think me a fool? We wouldn't hire an outsider to deal with a traitor.
GID00012852	Time to die!
GID00012853	[SUCCEEDED] They're not... are they? Okay, I'll deal with them later, after I deal with you by myself!
GID00012854	[SUCCEEDED] I... I've got to make sure our boss hears about this! Otherwise you'd be dead.
GID00012855	[FAILED] Time to die!
GID00012856	[FAILED] Time to die!
GID00012857	[SUCCEEDED] That much, huh? You're right, we could use a tribute to our... I mean, our family's coffers.
GID00012858	Okay, carry on. And, we've never been here, you understand? Boss doesn't need to know about this.
GID00012859	[FAILED] Sorry, no deal. Our loyalty to the family is not for sale.
GID00012860	[SUCCEEDED] That much, huh? You're right, we could use a tribute to our... I mean, our family's coffers.
GID00012861	Okay, carry on. And, we've never been here, you understand? Boss doesn't need to know about this.
GID00012862	[FAILED] Do you think us inferior men, willing to sell their soul for scraps! Enough of this.
GID00012863	Time to die!
GID00012864	Hahaha! Yeeeehaw! Now, that's something I thought I'd never hear.
GID00012865	All right, I'm going to get Ethel far away from this damned city and head back home. There's a worthy life waiting for us there.
GID00012866	People like Heck are rotten, kid, plenty of them in the Wasteland. They'll shoot you, kidnap your family, or drive NCR troops through your lands.
GID00012867	Whatever it takes to step over us honest folk is good enough in their book. Heck has bought NCR senators left and right, and then is even worse.
GID00012868	You have? What are you waiting for, kid? Spill the beans!
GID00012869	Hahaha! Yeeeehaw! Now, that's something I thought I'd never hear.
GID00012870	This deserves a good compensation, kid. How does that sound?
GID00012871	Good work. I'm sorry that stupid mail-order cowboy ended like that but his father's misery makes it well worthy.
GID00012872	This deserves a good compensation, kid. How does that sound?
GID00012873	Both Gundersons, gone? I'll be damned, you are one of a kind!
GID00012874	This deserves a good compensation, kid. How does that sound?
GID00012875	[SUCCEEDED] You'll leave me drier than tumbleweed, kid, but I reckon anything I can do to get back at Heck is well worth the expense.
GID00012876	I'm a man of my word. Here's your money. You've earned it.
GID00012877	[FAILED] Cut that in half and we got a clean deal, kid.
GID00012878	I'm a man of my word. Here's your money. You've earned it.
GID00012879	You don't want anything in return? That's rare in these times, got to say.
GID00012880	All right, kid! I appreciate it. I hope to see you soon.
GID00012881	You don't want anything in return? That's rare in these times, got to say.
GID00012882	All right, kid! I appreciate it. I hope to see you soon.
GID00012883	[SUCCEEDED] You'll leave me drier than tumbleweed, kid, but I reckon anything I can do to get back at Heck is well worth the expense.

GID00012899	You don't want anything in return? That's rare in these times, got to say.
GID00012900	That's what we said. So, do we have a deal?
GID00012901	All right, kid! I appreciate it. I hope to see you soon.
GID00012902	That's what we said. So, do we have a deal?
GID00012903	All right, kid! I appreciate it. I hope to see you soon.
GID00012904	I don't have time to explain now. Just do as you're told and we'll all be rich.
GID00012905	That's what I like about you. You follow orders, for the most part. Just remember to wait for the signal.
GID00012906	Not if we don't screw this up. I'm counting on you to do your part. Just wait for the signal. You'll know what to do.
GID00012907	You're welcome here any time.
GID00012908	We made a lot of money, that's what. The Legion paid us to deliver weapons, and the NCR paid us to deliver the Legion. Or some of them, anyway.
GID00012909	Oh, I do. They're a bunch of corrupt, bullying fools who think they can tell everyone how to live their lives, and my family's fought them for years.
GID00012910	But that's just it. Do you know how large the NCR army is? If they wanted to, they could have beaten us a dozen times over.
GID00012911	Do you know why they haven't? Money. Every time things have gotten too tense, we've paid them off and laid low for a while.
GID00012912	They're an enemy we can live with. This Caesar, on the other hand, is a different animal.
GID00012913	We've heard reports for years from our agents to the east. He doesn't tolerate his enemies, he makes examples of them.
GID00012914	And he doesn't have friends. Only servants. And the Van Graffs serve no one but themselves.
GID00012915	Given that, the choice was rather simple.
GID00012916	Caesar has been making overtures to prominent suppliers for some time now. Usually, they're too scared of him to cross him and just pay or flee.
GID00012917	I saw an opportunity and negotiated a deal with the NCR - I help draw some of their enemy's troops into a trap and they agree to buy from me.
GID00012918	Normally, those stuck-up bastards wouldn't have anything to do with us, but their situation is precarious, and this chance was too tempting.
GID00012919	Well... not exactly. The deal wasn't exactly sanctioned by my mother, but she'll come around when she hears about the profit I made.
GID00012920	If she's smart, and she is, believe me, she'll turn this to her own advantage and make a bundle off our new "connections" in the NCR.
GID00012921	Hardly. They've got a lot of soldiers, and slaves. But they don't come close to having the amount of wealth the NCR has.
GID00012922	When I said we were going to be rich, I meant it. The deal I brokered with the NCR netted me fives times what Caesar paid.
GID00012923	Keeping Caesar's money was just a bonus.
GID00012924	It'll be all I can do to supply the NCR with the amount of weapons they want, so I'll be pretty busy for the foreseeable future.
GID00012925	Oh, you're probably wondering if you still have a job! I don't have anything open at the moment, sadly.
GID00012926	But we're going to need all the help we can get transporting guns to the NCR, so stop by every now and then and I might have a delivery job for you.
GID00012927	And before I forget, here's your share of the take from the warehouse job. You can keep the armor. Thanks again for all your help.
GID00012928	Wait... what? Why would he do that?
GID00012929	Whatever the Chief had in mind, I'm sure it was the right thing to do - even if it did end up scaring a lot of people in the process.
GID00012930	The Chief should've known that the NCR is too stubborn to back down from anything, even when it's for the best.
GID00012931	While I'm glad it wasn't an enemy who was spreading lies and killing morale, I'm disappointed that a legend like the Chief felt he had to do it.
GID00012932	Dirty job, but I'm glad you did it. I'm not authorized to reward contract pay, but here's a little something for you.
GID00012933	And I'll let everyone know you did the right thing. Some people might not like it, but no one who matters. At least not as far as I'm concerned.
GID00012934	I have to admit, I didn't think you could do it. Guess that makes me the sap and you the hero.
GID00012935	I'm not authorized to pay for contract work, but here's something for the effort. And I'll make sure everyone hears about what you did. Thanks.
GID00012936	Then head back down into that camp and deal with the hostages.
GID00012937	Bye.
GID00012938	Hey, hold on. Just so you know, if you go down into that camp, one of two things is gonna happen.
GID00012939	Either that little head of yours is gonna sail into the Colorado courtesy of a Legion machete or they're gonna try to make friends with you.
GID00012940	And if I find out you're friends with the Legion, I'll put a lump of lead through your skull soon as you pop it back up over the ridge. Are we clear?
GID00012941	This should have you cleaned up in no time.
GID00012942	This should help with the pain.
GID00012943	This should flush those rads out quickly.
GID00012944	Yeah, Clanden will be hard to replace but not impossible. We'll find contractors just like him without breaking a sweat.
GID00012945	[SUCCEEDED] Are you shitting me? You didn't even know what the plan was? Yeah, as a last request I guess we can give you that courtesy.
GID00012946	[FAILED] Sorry, but you're going to have to die ignorant.
GID00012947	Caesar asked us to provide a distraction on the Strip. So when he gives the word we're going to launch an all out assault on the Strip.
GID00012948	First we're going to blow the Embassy, then we're going to use soldiers to kill every last motherfucker on the Strip. Then we'll run this joint.
GID00012949	That'll teach Not-At-Home what can go on while he sits in his fucking ivory tower lording down from on high.
GID00012950	Okay, lay down and I'll take care of you.
GID00012951	All right, honey. What do you want to know?
GID00012952	Stay for a while, hon. Jump in bed and let me do the rest.
GID00012953	Yes?
GID00012954	Imagine that! What's his name and when's he start?
GID00012955	A she, huh? Well... I guess the customer who made that request can't get everything he wants.
GID00012956	Hell, who knows? He might not even notice the difference.
GID00012957	Looks like that gives us a full roster of new ass to sell. Good work - enjoy the bonus.
GID00012958	A she, huh? Well... I guess the customer who made that request can't get everything he wants.
GID00012959	Hell, who knows? He might not even notice the difference.

GID00012961	A she, huh? Well... I guess the customer who made that request can't get everything he wants.
GID00012962	Hell, who knows? He might not even notice the difference.
GID00012963	A she, huh? Well... I guess the customer who made that request can't get everything he wants.
GID00012964	Hell, who knows? He might not even notice the difference.
GID00012965	The tribe calling themselves the Boomers is obsessed with such weapons, I've been told. You can probably find a spare firing mechanism there.
GID00012966	The trader, Dale Barton, salvaged it from a military base in Arizona. Yuma, I believe.
GID00012967	The best marksman of the NCR are usually at the rear of any battle. The gun will allow us to strike at them.
GID00012968	Non-alcoholic beverages and snack foods. The casinos get to sell booze. No one else does.
GID00012969	Take your pick.
GID00012970	Of course! I've got a special discount for special people, like you.
GID00012971	A friend of The Strip's a friend of mine.
GID00012972	Don't get me wrong, I appreciate your business, but dealing with you carries extra costs.
GID00012973	I'll sell to you, if only to get you out of sight as soon as possible.
GID00012974	It's the most amazing place in the world, don't you think? This must be what it was like to live a thousand years ago!
GID00012975	There are three casinos open for business - Gomorrah, The Tops, and the Ultra-Luxe. They get nicer in that order.
GID00012976	This here's the monorail station leading in from Camp McCarran. Most of my business is with soldiers coming and going on furlough.
GID00012977	Come back anytime!
GID00012978	See you soon, friend!
GID00012979	Yeah, don't cause me any trouble, okay?
GID00012980	Follow me, hon.
GID00012981	And who would that be?
GID00012982	That honey-mouthed sonofabitch? Fine. At least he'll have to shut up occasionally.
GID00012983	Those pretty lips of his are going to see more traffic than a Brahmin trail in low summer!
GID00012984	Looks like that gives us a full roster of new ass to sell. Good work - enjoy the bonus.
GID00012985	That honey-mouthed sonofabitch? Fine. At least he'll have to shut up occasionally.
GID00012986	Those pretty lips of his are going to see more traffiic than a Brahmin trail in low summer!
GID00012987	Looks like that gives us a full roster of new ass to sell. Good work - enjoy the bonus.
GID00012988	That honey-mouthed sonofabitch? Fine. At least he'll have to shut up occasionally.
GID00012989	Those pretty lips of his are going to see more traffic than a Brahmin trail in low summer!
GID00012990	That honey-mouthed sonofabitch? Fine. At least he'll have to shut up occasionally.
GID00012991	Those pretty lips of his are going to see more traffic than a Brahmin trail in low summer!
GID00012992	That honey-mouthed sonofabitch owes me a scad of caps! He'll feel like a Brahmin hitching post by the time he's worked off his debt!
GID00012993	Looks like that gives us a full roster of new ass to sell. Good work - enjoy the bonus.
GID00012994	That honey-mouthed sonofabitch owes me a scad of caps! He'll feel like a Brahmin hitching post by the time he's worked off his debt!

GID00012998	What did you want to know?
GID00012999	Bill Ronte installed that pump a few years ago, back when he was sober. It was a major improvement for the community.
GID00013000	But lately The Kings have started charging locals to use it - and NCR squatters twice as much. That'll come to no good.
GID00013001	They've been Freeside's gang for the past five years or so, ever since Mr. House and his Three Families pushed everyone else out of Vegas.
GID00013002	They've done a lot of good for the community - but that seems to be changing. The flood of NCR squatters has been an affront to them.
GID00013003	I guess that explains the situation with the water pump. Usually The King wouldn't let his crew bully folks around like that.
GID00013004	I know they sell a lot of guns - as if that's what Freeside needs. I hear Mick handles the guns. No idea what Ralph does.
GID00013005	Oh, them. They sell energy weapons, which are very popular with better-heeled prospectors looking to explore the wastes.
GID00013006	Stay clear of them. Brother and sister are both psychopaths, though at least Gloria is rational. Jean-Baptiste likes killing.
GID00013007	A den of iniquity. The Garrets do more than their share to keep the locals drunk or high enough to stay lazy.
GID00013008	Their thugs, on the other hand, they keep wired on chems to stay dangerous. What is it with Freeside and brother-sister psychopath teams?
GID00013009	All right. What did you want to know?
GID00013010	What do you want to know?
GID00013011	If you haven't heard of The King, you must have been living under a rock or something.
GID00013012	The King has his boys all over Freeside. He controls the water pump and is essentially the go-to guy for what goes around here.
GID00013013	They are the local energy weapon dealers in Freeside. When it comes to lasers and plasma, they're the only game in town and they keep it that way.
GID00013014	Gloria's men are the best armed in Freeside and ruthless to boot, but her brother, Jean-Baptiste Cutting, puts them all to shame.
GID00013015	Their joint is the only place in Freeside to get it all under one roof. They've got gambling, booze, chems, and whores.
GID00013016	They're good folks, just don't cross them. They're known for tidying up loose ends with a bullet to the brain box.
GID00013017	Hadrian, the insult comic! "Did I stutter, fucktard?
GID00013018	See, I'm using insults to promote the act. That was my idea!
GID00013019	One-liners! The epi-tome of comedy! Little nuggets of hilarity irresistibly bringing forth laughter!
GID00013020	You know, like "is that your face, or is a bowl of puke stuck in your collar?" I tell you, you gotta see this show!
GID00013021	At the coolest, hippest, swinging-est joint on the Strip, that's where! The Tops, baby - don't miss it!
GID00013022	No need to be rude, pal. Just trying to bring the joy of entertainment into your life!
GID00013023	Way I hear it, he's some whack job who used to spend his nights sitting around a campfire and howling to himself.
GID00013024	"Who wants to hear songs that make you wanna cry?" I try to tell them. But hey, they don't pay me to ask questions.
GID00013025	Do me a favor - go see the show. Otherwise they'll think I didn't do my job.
GID00013026	A velvety-voiced cool cat fresh out of New Reno, that's who! When Bruce sings, his smokey, dulcet tones will transport you to another world!
GID00013027	The Tops casino, my friend! If you're in the mood to knock back a few and frolic the night away, ain't no better place on Earth!
GID00013028	This will help with the pain.
GID00013029	Yeah, they were here a while ago. Gave them all I could, which wasn't much. But as many problems as we're having here, I know they've got it worse.
GID00013030	I've seen soldiers get assigned there. It's like they got told they were gonna die. I wouldn't wish it on anybody.
GID00013031	If you're trying to track them down, we put a GPS marker in the supply crate. You can track it with your Pip-Boy. Good luck.
GID00013032	You've done the right thing, citizen. Reporting struggles, scuffles, and tussles is the civic duty of every man, woman, and child.
GID00013033	Thanks to you, we can all sleep in our beds a little sounder, knowing that swift justice awaits those who take moral shortcuts for personal gain.
GID00013034	Rest assured, I will apprehend the perpetrator and see him or her punished. Even though, in some ways, evil is its own punishment.
GID00013035	Ah, yes, I've heard that one too. Jealous people say such nasty things. I feel sorry for them.
GID00013036	Good. Then you know what it is to be discreet in matters of... nutrition. Perhaps you can help me.
GID00013037	[SUCCEEDED] Good. Then you know what it is to be discreet in matters of... nutrition. Perhaps you can help me.
GID00013038	[FAILED] Please, you're embarrassing yourself. I must request that you change the subject.
GID00013039	I can assure you that the only thing the White Glove Society is guilty of is preparing the tastiest cuisine you'll ever sample.
GID00013040	That is, of course, if you can afford it.
GID00013041	Indeed. Let's.
GID00013042	No, not from the likes of you, I'm afraid. I don't think you'd have the stomach for it. Better look elsewhere.
GID00013043	I do, but I need someone I know I can rely on. And I haven't heard a thing about you.
GID00013044	Perhaps if you made more of a name for yourself around the Strip, we could talk. But not before.
GID00013045	Yes, I'm glad you asked. I've heard about you, you know. You strike me as just the sort of person who can help me.
GID00013046	I'm in a bind. I've been planning an exquisite Society dinner, but there's a bit of a problem with the main course.
GID00013047	He's got a powerful and temperamental father.
GID00013048	Yes. The wrong person. We scouted the right one for weeks. The heir to a mercantile empire. Sort of a black sheep.
GID00013049	He cut ties with his family and left their estate to wander. He was ideal. Corn-fed and well-to-do, but no one to miss him if he were to disappear.
GID00013050	Unfortunately the trap my subordinates set for him failed. And as he escaped, he saw their faces. Now he's wary.
GID00013051	You barbarous cur.
GID00013052	Perhaps I do. Forget I mentioned it.
GID00013053	I asked for a last-minute replacement. And they stole the son of the most dangerous Brahmin baron in New Vegas while he stayed at this very hotel.
GID00013054	Needless to say, this could be a disaster if things aren't put back the way they should be. And I still need somebody reputable to serve for dinner.
GID00013055	Strictly speaking, we're no longer allowed to eat people. But I'm hoping the right person and preparation might sway Marjorie to see things my way.
GID00013056	I need a replacement, and I need the boy taken care of. The replacement must be healthy and well-bred. One can't very well make steak from gristle.
GID00013057	With so little time, we'll have go after our original choice, Carlyle St. Clair. He lives in a shack north of here. For freshness, we need him alive.
GID00013058	If you could send him here or knock him out with this and drag him into the dumpster next to his house, we can do the rest.
GID00013059	Ted Gunderson is his name. It would be simplest if you could convince him this was all an unfortunate misunderstanding.
GID00013060	But if he won't listen, we can't very well let him go. He'll have to be slaughtered and served. Then we wouldn't need the replacement.
GID00013061	But you would need to deal with his father, Heck. Perhaps if you could smear some of Ted's blood around his father's hotel room, you could frame him.
GID00013062	Splendid, splendid. The boy is being held in the kitchen beneath the Gourmand. Here are some keys that will allow you access to him.
GID00013063	The elder Gunderson is staying in our penthouse. I understand he's hired security, so be careful if you go up there.
GID00013064	And our Mr. St. Clair resides to the north. He rarely strays far from his house, and he's surrounded it with booby traps.
GID00013065	Very well, but I'll need to know soon or I'll be forced to make other plans.
GID00013066	Which one?
GID00013067	Hmm. He's a little thin, but he looks like he comes from good stock with that strong jaw and upright posture.
GID00013068	Perhaps a little rugged, a little gamey. But he is in good shape and looks healthy.
GID00013069	From the smell of her I'd say we can skip the whiskey marinade. But other than her liver she seems to be in working order.
GID00013070	Her skin has a certain supple quality to it, doesn't it? She's kept it well. How mouth-watering.
GID00013071	I'm sorry, but it absolutely must be a human. Former doesn't count.
GID00013072	I assume you're joking.
GID00013073	Very well. If you're able to convince young Mr. Gunderson to return to his father, replace him in the freezer with your friend and we'll have a deal.
GID00013074	So the baron has slaughtered his last Brahmin. How delightful. He was a pox on our business.
GID00013075	He would've driven the price of beef down to the point where any poor wretch could afford it. Can you imagine?
GID00013076	But now we can price it even higher, create a new luxury market. Not for you, of course. You'll get a special discount.
GID00013077	We'll know after tonight's banquet at 7 o'clock. I'll only be telling everyone what they've eaten after they've eaten it.
GID00013078	That way, they will all have crossed the same silly taboo. They'll have to reconsider it. Even Marjorie.
GID00013079	It's all image with her, anyway. She just needs to realize the only difference between savage and sophisticated is the proper seasoning.
GID00013080	We'll know after tomorrow night's banquet at 7 o'clock. I'll only be telling everyone what they've eaten after they've eaten it.
GID00013081	That way, they will all have crossed the same silly taboo. They'll have to reconsider it. Even Marjorie.
GID00013082	It's all image with her, anyway. She just needs to realize the only difference between savage and sophisticated is the proper seasoning.
GID00013083	I certainly did. Philippe created an extraordinary amuse bouche from the flesh of the Gunderson boy.
GID00013084	I certainly did. Philippe created an extraordinary amuse bouche from the flesh of the late Mr. St. Clair.
GID00013085	I certainly did. Philippe created an extraordinary amuse bouche from the flesh of your former travel partner.
GID00013086	Everyone at the banquet loved it! I told them what it was and the room was quiet for a moment, but then we all had a hearty laugh.
GID00013087	I see. Keep me in the know.
GID00013088	You have done very well in keeping this business low-key. I appreciate your discretion. I'll be sure to drop your name during our functions.
GID00013089	I hope you understand what a tremendous boon this will be to your standing in society.
GID00013090	Good. Having his father's attention cast upon me was the last thing I needed.
GID00013091	Now if you can lure Mr. St. Clair out of his home and into captivity, and he's still disease-free, I shall breathe a sigh of relief.
GID00013092	I see. Well this could get out of hand very quickly unless something is done to keep the elder Gunderson in check.
GID00013093	You mustn't kill him, though. The publicity would be a disaster. I need you to handle this quietly, like we discussed.
GID00013094	A little blood in his suite should do the trick. And if you have a Securitron arrest him, our involvement will appear nonexistent.
GID00013095	No. Everyone he meets, he tells the same story. That his son disappeared from the casino, not from his room. He'll look guilty.
GID00013096	You made it past his guards, then? Excellent. Send a Securitron up to his room. It's programmed to investigate anything suspicious.
GID00013097	[SUCCEEDED] My daddy's got a lot of enemies. It don't make no sense that the White Pants Society would kidnap me. He's here to do business with them.
GID00013098	Well, you got a point. But if you don't know who it is, my daddy's gonna be awful mad he ain't got anyone to shoot over this.
GID00013099	All right. Let's get out of here.
GID00013100	[FAILED] Who gives a rat's patoot if they're sorry? Sorry's what they'll be when they're strung up and lynched by my daddy's posse.
GID00013101	These White Knuckles got hell to pay, I'll see to that when I get outta here.
GID00013102	What did you say...? I mean, Joana sent you?
GID00013103	Please, tell me! Is she all right? When did you see her? What does she have to say?
GID00013104	Then she has to know! I'm ready to help her escape, once and for all.
GID00013105	Why am I even scared of Cachino and all those fuckers? Joana and I are dead anyway if we don't get the hell out of here.
GID00013106	Dammit! You're going to leave me hanging, huh? Don't know how else I can get her back.
GID00013107	Until next round.
GID00013108	Questions can wait, Joana can't.
GID00013109	Deal! Come back with news soon, you hear?
GID00013110	Deal! Come back with news soon, you hear?
GID00013111	Okay, you try that and let me know. How she looks, what she's wearing, she's safe, anything - I'll pay you, you hear?
GID00013112	Deal! Come back with news soon, you hear?
GID00013113	Depends on why you're asking.
GID00013114	Let's just say it had something to do with the beards, and leave it at that.
GID00013115	See you around.
GID00013116	We'll take care of Carlitos, don't worry.
GID00013117	I see. Well, he can count on Little Beard and me for an assist. Tell us where and when, and we'll be there.
GID00013118	So you said. All Little Beard and me need to know is the when and where.
GID00013119	I see. Well, he can count on Little Beard and me for an assist. Tell us where and when, and we'll be there.
GID00013120	The Beards will be there.
GID00013121	You saw our front sign, didn't you? This is where all the beautiful signs of the Strip become a reality.
GID00013122	It all comes from Michael Angelo's imagination. We do a little work here and there too, sure, but he's the real artist.
GID00013123	You saw our front sign, didn't you? This is where all the beautiful signs of the Strip become a reality.
GID00013124	Check out the back of the shop, he's usually working there.
GID00013125	Bye.
GID00013126	He's the reason the Strip shines like a star at night. Mike's imagined and built every sign, billboard and light you'll see around here.
GID00013127	I've been here over a year now. Though I'm not one to get tied for long.
GID00013128	I plan to roam the Wasteland once I'm ready. The people need light and kindness, there's too much fear and pain out there already.
GID00013129	Perfect. We're still getting everything together, but I can always find a use for idle hands in the meantime.
GID00013130	Once we're settled, we'll head out to the rendezvous point.
GID00013131	That's okay, I still need some time to get everything together. The logistics of an order like this are headache inducing.
GID00013132	We won't need to head out for a while yet, so stop back when you have the time.
GID00013133	I thought so. Come back when you've got a backbone.
GID00013134	Her name's Rose of Sharon Cassidy. That's some fancy shit, right? Don't know what her mother was thinking with a name like that.
GID00013135	But this girl and I, we need to have a discussion. Find her, bring her here, so I can talk to her, one-on-one.
GID00013136	Find her, bring her back here so we can talk. Needless to say, there's some good money in it for you.
GID00013137	You already agreed to take the job, asshole. There's no backing out now.
GID00013138	<Jean-Baptiste just stares at you.>
GID00013139	Guess I don't have to worry about talking with her, then. About fucking time. Any longer and I was gonna track you both down.
GID00013140	Anyway, Glory's been antsy lately because that big deal she's been working on is finally going down.
GID00013141	If this thing goes down, we'll have it made. Fucking made, I tell you! Talk to her about it. I'm sure she'll want you along.
GID00013142	And don't think I forgot your pay. A job well done is its own reward, but it doesn't pay for pussy at the local brothel, does it?
GID00013143	Well work fucking faster. I don't like thinking there's someone out there that hates me more than I hate them.
GID00013144	Do you have what we requested?
GID00013145	Don't play games with me. The question was just a formality. Now do you have what we requested?
GID00013146	I don't think so. My men watched you head straight for this location. Now do you have what we requested?
GID00013147	We were told there would be no questions. Do you have what we requested or not?
GID00013148	Ah, then our business is concluded. Tell your superiors that we will contact them shortly.
GID00013149	I wasn't informed there was to be an exchange on my part. What are you talking about?
GID00013150	[SUCCEEDED] Such a thing is possible. I've been out in the field for some time. Fine, this should cover your grievance.
GID00013151	Now, the package, if you will.
GID00013152	[FAILED] I've heard no such report. I'd have to check with my contacts before agreeing to such an exchange, and there's no time for that.
GID00013153	Now, the package, if you will.
GID00013154	Fine, now do you have the package or not?
GID00013155	That you would have something for me. Now do you or not?
GID00013156	Maybe, but the situation around here calls for it. You gonna help or not?
GID00013157	I can spare a few moments, make it quick.
GID00013158	Things are looking good. With the new resources and support, morale is at the highest it's ever been around here.
GID00013159	Well, things have been improving lately. More supplies, more troops. We might actually be able to turn things around.
GID00013160	We're hanging in there. Things wouldn't be so bad if we could actually get some reinforcements or supplies, but we'll just have to survive for now.
GID00013161	Not good. We still haven't gotten any support from the rest of the NCR and the Legion is kicking our ass right now.
GID00013162	It's no picnic, I'll tell you that much. My troops are out here every day dying for the NCR, but they've left us out to dry.
GID00013163	We have no men or supplies and we're stretched too thin trying to guard the entire river.
GID00013164	If the brass back home could get their heads out of their asses long enough to send support, we could turn this all around.
GID00013165	Make it quick.
GID00013166	We don't have many troops, so we can only attack from one direction. Where should we focus the attack?
GID00013167	Make it quick, we don't want to lose the element of surprise.
GID00013168	North it is. Reports also say that they might have some NCR hostages. If that's true we need to do what we can to save them. So stay sharp.
GID00013169	Our main target is the Legion leader at Nelson. Intel has the commander as one Dead Sea. I've uploaded his last known location to your Pip-Boy.
GID00013170	Let's move out!
GID00013171	Our main targets are the Legion leaders at Nelson. I've uploaded their last known locations to your Pip-Boy.
GID00013172	East it is. Reports also say that they might have some NCR hostages. If that's true we need to do what we can to save them. So stay sharp.
GID00013173	Our main target is the Legion leader at Nelson. Intel has the commander as one Dead Sea. I've uploaded his last known location to your Pip-Boy.
GID00013174	Let's move out!
GID00013175	Our main targets are the Legion leaders at Nelson. I've uploaded their last known locations to your Pip-Boy.
GID00013176	Okay, I admit it, I ain't exactly rolling in caps here, but whaddya want? I'm under contract, I can't get out.
GID00013177	Eesh... say, you wouldn't happen to have been my manager in a past life, would you? You've got all his money-smarts.
GID00013178	Heh, good luck. Garret's a tough, mean sonofabitch, he's not likely to give up. Let me know if you make any headway.
GID00013179	Ain't my mind needs changing, kid, it's Garret's.
GID00013180	It's great to be here at the Tops, folks. The room I'm in has a lovely little closet. A nail.
GID00013181	Thank you everybody, you've been a great audience, good night.
GID00013182	It's hard to sleep in this place, I tell you. Last night some girl was pounding on my door all night. Finally I had to let her out.
GID00013183	They really care about your privacy here at the Tops. Even room service has an unlisted number!
GID00013184	My hotel room is so small, when I put the key in the lock, I broke the window!
GID00013185	How about that suit Benny wears? If I had a suit like that, the ladies would be all over me. What, you expect a punchline? This guy pays my salary!
GID00013186	I told my wife she was good-looking for a ghoul. It's just too bad she's not a ghoul.
GID00013187	I love these robots with the friendly little policeman's faces. Sure, they still rough you up, but they look so happy!
GID00013188	My cousin and his wife are a fastidious couple. She's fast and he's hideous.
GID00013189	I know a guy, his motto is Love Thy Neighbor. He lives next door to a brothel.
GID00013190	I try to be frank and earnest with women. In New Reno, I'm Frank and in the Boneyard I'm Ernest.
GID00013191	I've been married for 17 years. Where did I go wrong?
GID00013192	I've been in love with the same woman for 17 years. If my wife ever finds out, she'll kill me!
GID00013193	My wife and I know the secret to a happy marriage. Two times a week, we go to a nice restaurant. She goes Mondays, I go Fridays.
GID00013194	I take my wife everywhere, but somehow she keeps finding her way back.
GID00013195	I bought my wife a little car here in New Vegas. An Omerta. It has a hood under the hood.
GID00013196	People say it's hard to survive the Wasteland - how hard can it be, the water glows in the dark!
GID00013197	So I hear Mr. House runs the Strip. He took it over from the last guy, Mr. Mob-Infested Hellhole.
GID00013198	I had dinner at the Ultra-Luxe the other night. I told them my steak tasted funny. They said it was a clown.
GID00013199	I hear James Garret drove 5,000 head of Brahmin to New Reno. No bodies, just the heads.
GID00013200	A ghoul goes to a doctor and he says "Doctor, Doctor, I have this horrible rash!" The Doctor says "Son, that's called your face."
GID00013201	It's great to be up here, looking down at all your smiling faces. That won't last long.
GID00013202	Hey, look at this guy! I didn't know they let Brahmin into this joint!
GID00013203	Hey, look at this gal! I didn't know they let Brahmin into this joint!
GID00013204	Hey, look at this guy! Those muscles are unreal - I mean it, they're imaginary!
GID00013205	Hey, look at this gal! Those muscles are unreal - I mean it, they're imaginary!
GID00013206	This guy's so sharp-eyed, he cuts himself every time he blinks!
GID00013207	This gal's so sharp-eyed, she cuts herself every time she blinks!
GID00013208	I tell ya, you've got great eyes. You could spot a Super mutant at three paces.
GID00013209	Buddy, you look tough enough to drink a pint of glowing water. Why don't you do us all a favor and try it?
GID00013210	Sister, you look tough enough to drink a pint of glowing water. Why don't you do us all a favor and try it?
GID00013211	Whoa, you don't look too healthy. Maybe you should see a doctor. Or an undertaker.
GID00013212	I hear you've got a ready wit. Tell me when it's ready.
GID00013213	My friend, you've got style, grace, and charm - the style of a feral Ghoul, the grace of a Super mutant, and the charm of a Deathclaw.
GID00013214	Somebody told me the other day you were bright - I wasn't sure if he meant smart, or radioactive.
GID00013215	The way I hear it, you've got brains to spare. Looks to me like a 7-10 split.
GID00013216	And talk about your quick reflexes, this guy is so fast he beat me to the punchline.
GID00013217	And talk about your quick reflexes, this gal is so fast she beat me to the punchline.
GID00013218	Boy, you're clumsy. You're so clumsy when you slip in the shower, you fall up.
GID00013219	This guy right here, he's got an angel looking over his shoulder. If I were him, I'd get a restraining order.
GID00013220	This gal right here, she's got an angel looking over her shoulder. If I were her, I'd get a restraining order.
GID00013221	You know, some people have all the luck. Some people, not you.
GID00013222	Was that suit made to order? It was? And where were you at the time?
GID00013223	If you had your life to live over again, let me make a suggestion: Play in traffic.
GID00013224	Look at you, you look like a talent scout for a cemetery.
GID00013225	The more I think of you, the less I think of you.
GID00013226	How about a hand for the Rad Pack, the band that inspired that great saying, "Stop the music!"
GID00013227	Swank is here, ladies and gentlemen. Make yourself at home, Swank - hit somebody!
GID00013228	Now, you see, you should have opened with that. I'll sell you his contract, but it will cost you.
GID00013229	[SUCCEEDED] I suppose you've got a point. Plenty of Brahmin on the prairie, and all that. Fine, I'll cut him loose. He's all yours.
GID00013230	[FAILED] That's the stupidest argument I've ever heard. I'm not letting my star performer go without some guarantee of new incomes.
GID00013231	[SUCCEEDED] I admit that thought had crossed my mind. Maybe you're right - maybe I'd do better with a human act. He's all yours.
GID00013232	[FAILED] That may be the case, but I can't risk that kind of cash-flow. You'll have to do better than that.
GID00013233	Ah. I suppose that's a very... compelling negotiating stance. Fine. The contract is yours. I hope you choke on it.
GID00013234	[SUCCEEDED] Well, I see there's no fooling you in a horse trade. Fine - you've got a deal.
GID00013235	[FAILED] No, no I don't think you will. The deal is final.
GID00013236	Pleasure doing business with you.
GID00013237	Take your time - the ghoul's not going anywhere.
GID00013238	Pleasure doing business with you.
GID00013239	Take your time - the ghoul's not going anywhere.
GID00013240	They run the place as a center for all their dirty scams and extortions. Gambling, sex, drugs, they'll use whatever works to exploit your weaknesses.
GID00013241	Hooker, customer, it doesn't matter. Everyone here's a pawn to the Omertas, playing and dying by their rules.
GID00013242	Nero's the pack leader and Big Sal's his right hand. What Nero wants, Big Sal does. Then there's... Cachino.
GID00013243	What? Have you seen him? Have you talked to him?
GID00013244	Yes?
GID00013245	I... look, we can't talk here. If you think you can help me, follow me to my room, please.
GID00013246	He... does? Wait, this changes everything. I can't leave my girls here... and, where would we go even if we escape?
GID00013247	No. It's too risky, we'll all end up dead.
GID00013248	No. It's too risky, we'll all end up dead.
GID00013249	But the Omertas will want us dead. What are we going to do about that?
GID00013250	Let Carlitos know that we'll be ready when you are.
GID00013251	Okay, what's on your mind?
GID00013252	[FAILED] I'm not, but questions bore me, hon.
GID00013253	[SUCCEEDED] I... look, we can't talk here. If you think you can help me, follow me to my room, please.
GID00013254	[SUCCEEDED] I'm... I don't know what's happening to me. I can't feel a goddamn thing anymore, empty and poisoned like the Wasteland.
GID00013255	I'm afraid I won't make it out of here, not without Carlitos. If the Med-X doesn't kill me first, Cachino or another Omerta will.
GID00013256	Ha, I look pathetic, huh? The great Joana and now... I don't even know why I'm telling you this.
GID00013257	[FAILED] I'm not, but questions bore me, hon.
GID00013258	[SUCCEEDED] I... I didn't think it showed. I guess that it's worse than I thought.
GID00013259	I... look, we can't talk here. If you think you can help me, follow me to my room, please.
GID00013260	[SUCCEEDED] I... I didn't think it showed. I guess that it's worse than I thought.
GID00013261	[SUCCEEDED] You sound so sure. Damn it all, you better not make me regret this later.
GID00013262	But the Omertas will want us dead. What are we going to do about that?
GID00013263	[FAILED] Sorry, I can't risk our lives without more guarantees than that.
GID00013264	[SUCCEEDED] To be free and with Carlitos again... Tell him that I still, I - never mind.
GID00013265	Let Carlitos know that we'll be ready when you are.
GID00013266	Thank you so much for your help.
GID00013267	[FAILED] Sorry, I can't risk our lives without more guarantees than that.
GID00013268	He's a filthy monster. I've been with perverted men but Cachino's done things... to me, that -
GID00013269	Even other Omertas would also want to kill him if they knew what he does. He's broken so many of their rules that I don't know how he still breathes.
GID00013270	I'm... I don't know what's happening to me. I can't feel a goddamn thing anymore, empty and poisoned like the Wasteland.
GID00013271	I'm afraid I won't make it out of here, not without Carlitos. If the Med-X doesn't kill me first, Cachino or another Omerta will.
GID00013272	Ha, I look pathetic, huh? The great Joana and now... I don't even know why I'm telling you this.
GID00013273	As I told you, Carlitos was the only thing that kept me alive in this place. Now, I just don't know what'll happen.
GID00013274	He was an Omerta that... fell in love with me. They don't ever mix with people outside the "family," you know?
GID00013275	He was planning to escape with me but Cachino found out about us. So he did something, talked, I don't know, and Carlitos disappeared.
GID00013276	Cachino doesn't give a shit about rules, only cares to feed his perversions. He lusted for me, he's done things to me.
GID00013277	Look... I'm stuck here, I know that. Carlitos is the only thing that kept me going, and now I don't have anything left.
GID00013278	What? Have you seen him? Have you talked to him?
GID00013279	Damn shame. Anything else I can do for you?
GID00013280	What? Carlitos is alive? Please, tell him that I still love him, that I want to escape with him... please.
GID00013281	If he's alive he's long gone. The Omertas want him dead, now.
GID00013282	If you meet him, anywhere... I'd do anything to get him back and escape this hell, although I'm not keeping my hopes up.
GID00013283	Hon, nobody's given me a free thing before. What's it going to be for you, caps, sex, straps, what?
GID00013284	What? Are you... serious? Well, I'm not complaining, hon.
GID00013285	Thank you so much for your help.
GID00013286	That sounds good, hon. I hope to see you soon.
GID00013287	Yes... I know what you want. And I know how to give it to you, right now.
GID00013288	Yes?
GID00013289	If you meet him, anywhere... I'd do anything to get him back and escape this hell, although I'm not keeping my hopes up.
GID00013290	There were tales once, of a cannibal tribe near Vegas, one that hid itself in a cavern far below ground, hunting men as prey above.
GID00013291	The scouts I occasionally sent west many years ago reported these tales, but never had contact. Well, except the ones who went missing, perhaps.
GID00013292	There are rumors that the White Gloves might be this lost tribe. Maybe you can help them find themselves.
GID00013293	Culture is an odd thing. Sometimes a tribe grows tired of its identity, grabs for an opportunity to reimagine itself.
GID00013294	The tribe becomes its own antithesis. Everything flips to the opposite polarity.
GID00013295	Dialectics tells us that this can't last. There has to be a synthesis, a final sorting out.
GID00013296	I'll hand it to that piece of shit, he was determined. He used some kind of Old-World stealth device to get across the river in a Legion boat.
GID00013297	Seems the device ran out of juice once he got here, but he was dressed like a Legionary. He was caught just outside the weather station.
GID00013298	See, thing is, he didn't change his hairstyle. To go through all that effort and fail because you're too vain to muss your hair...
GID00013299	He was brought before me, along with the Platinum Chip. That's how I knew he wasn't some kind of Profligate infiltrator.
GID00013300	Benny tried to sell me a story, but Lucius has a way coaxing the truth out of captives. Everything just comes spilling out.
GID00013301	Do you want my opinion as a former citizen, or future conqueror? Actually, my opinion's the same either way.
GID00013302	As a young man I was taught to venerate President Tandi of Shady Sands. "The Founding Mother of the New California Republic."
GID00013303	Did you know her Presidency lasted 52 years? And that her father, Aradesh, was the Republic's first President?
GID00013304	Does that sound like democracy to you, or a hereditary dictatorship?
GID00013305	Because the council didn't dare oppose her. She was too popular. She had the people's love.
GID00013306	So things ran smoothly, more or less. And as soon as she was gone, as soon as there really could be "democracy" - what happened then?
GID00013307	Ever since losing its queen, the NCR has been weaker, more diffuse. Democracy has been its weakness, not its strength.
GID00013308	Greed runs rampant. The government is corrupt, accepting bribes from Brahmin barons and landowners, to the detriment of citizens.
GID00013309	The NCR is a loose conglomerate of individuals looking out for themselves. It's lost virtue. No one cares about the collective, the greater good.
GID00013310	It's not built to last. I'm just hastening the inevitable.
GID00013311	Of course. The most powerful my Legion has faced. Also the first to which I am ideologically opposed.
GID00013312	Until now, every tribe I've conquered has been so backwards and stunted, enslavement has been a gift bestowed upon them.
GID00013313	My conquest of the Mojave will be a glorious triumph, marking the transition of the Legion from a basically nomadic tribe to a genuine empire.
GID00013314	Just as my namesake campaigned in Gaul before he crossed the Rubicon, so have I campaigned, and will cross the Colorado.
GID00013315	I know he's a coward, hiding behind an army of robots, ensconced in that tower of his like a wizard in one of those Grognak comic books.
GID00013316	Some say he's a man, others, a machine. I don't care. He's in the way.
GID00013317	I know he's dead. I know he's no longer a factor. That's all I need to know.
GID00013318	Losers don't matter in the history books. He's a fucking footnote.
GID00013319	I've analyzed the region's tribes to determine how they might be useful. I may tell you more at a later time, if it suits me.
GID00013320	Here, this document has clear instructions on what to do next.
GID00013321	Here, these written orders make it plain.
GID00013322	These written orders will tell you what to do next.
GID00013323	See Vulpes for details about your next mission.
GID00013324	For further instructions, see Vulpes.
GID00013325	Go see Vulpes. He'll brief you.
GID00013326	Go see Lucius for details about your next mission.
GID00013327	For further instructions, see Lucius.
GID00013328	Go see Lucius. He'll brief you.
GID00013329	Ironically, I was born a Profligate myself, a citizen of the NCR.
GID00013330	My family lived not far from the great Boneyard. After Raiders killed my father, my mother sought the Followers' protection. I was two years old.
GID00013331	She found work at their Library, cooking and cleaning. I learned how to read and soon I was taking courses, free of charge.
GID00013332	Oh yes, raised in that tradition. And the teaching stuck. I was taught it was my responsibility to bring the torch of knowledge to the wastes.
GID00013333	I may have taken the torch part more literally than they intended.
GID00013334	When I was 20, the Followers sent me East to Grand Canyon. It was my first expedition, just me and a physician named Calhoun.
GID00013335	As an anthropologist and linguist, my assignment was to learn the dialects of the Grand Canyon tribes. What a fucking waste of time!
GID00013336	If you think it's worthwhile to make smart people learn how to talk like backward savages, you're a Follower of the Apocalypse... or an idiot.
GID00013337	Anyway, we met up with a Mormon missionary who already knew a bunch of dialects - Joshua Graham. He was supposed to teach me.
GID00013338	But before that went too far, the Blackfoot tribe captured us, to hold us for ransom.
GID00013339	They were a backward bunch. But the real problem was, they didn't know how to fight.
GID00013340	The Blackfoot were at war with seven other tribes, each just as pissant as they were. But outnumbered like that, they weren't going to last long.
GID00013341	It's one thing to be taken hostage, another to be lashed to a sinking ship. So over Calhoun's objections, I decided to take certain steps.
GID00013342	I taught them how to use the guns they already had - how to strip and clean them, how to breathe when pulling a trigger, how to reload ammunition.
GID00013343	They looked at me like I was some kind of a sorcerer. So I taught them how to make explosives, and started drilling them on small unit tactics.
GID00013344	If there's anything I learned as a Follower of the Apocalypse, it's that there's a lot of good information in old books.
GID00013345	Divide et impera - divide and conquer. I led the Blackfoot against the Ridgers, their weakest enemy.
GID00013346	When they refused to surrender, I ordered every man, woman, and child killed. When next we surrounded the Kaibabs and they likewise refused...
GID00013347	I took one of their envoys to the Ridgers' village and showed him the corpse piles.
GID00013348	This was new for the tribes, you see. They played at war, raiding each other, a little rape and pillage here, a little ransoming there.
GID00013349	I showed them total warfare. Like I said, there's a lot you can learn from old books.
GID00013350	The Kaibabs joined me, and the Fredonians after that - all the pissant tribes, with names that should be forgotten.
GID00013351	I knew from the start I'd need to eradicate this plague of tribal identities, replacing them with a monolithic culture, a uniform identity.
GID00013352	So that's what I did, once my confederation of tribes was large enough. I crowned myself Caesar and created a single Great Tribe - my Legion.
GID00013353	I sent Calhoun, the Follower captured with me, back West with a message that I should not be interfered with.
GID00013354	Joshua Graham, the Mormon interpreter, stayed with me and served as my first Legatus.
GID00013355	That's right. Decades of warfare, absorbing lesser tribes, gathering power. Forging the dross into a vast, razor-sharp scythe.
GID00013356	My Legion's expansion has never ceased. Much of the Utah and Colorado, and all of Arizona and New Mexico, are mine.
GID00013357	We have cities of our own, but nothing compared to Vegas. Finally, my Legion will have its Rome.
GID00013358	I used imperial Rome as the model for my Legion precisely because it was so foreign, so alien.
GID00013359	I'd seen what had become of the NCR's attempts to emulate the culture of Pre-War America - the in-fighting, the corruption.
GID00013360	Rome was a highly militarized autocracy that effectively integrated the foreign cultures it conquered.
GID00013361	It dedicated its citizens to something higher than themselves - to the idea of Rome itself.
GID00013362	In Rome I found a template for a society equal to the challenges of the post-apocalyptic world - a society that could and would survive.
GID00013363	A society that could prevent mankind from fracturing and destroying itself in this new world, by establishing a new Pax Romana.
GID00013364	It means a nationalist, imperialist, totalitarian, homogenous culture that obliterates the identity of every group it conquers.
GID00013365	Long-term stability at all costs. The individual has no value beyond his utility to the state, whether as an instrument of war, or production.
GID00013366	No, I'll destroy it because it's inevitable that it be destroyed. It's Hegelian Dialectics, not personal animosity.
GID00013367	How do I put this basically enough? It's a philosophical theory, the kind you might encounter if you took time to read some books.
GID00013368	The fundamental premise is to envision history as a sequence of "dialectical" conflicts. Each dialectic begins with a proposition, a thesis...
GID00013369	...which inherently contains, or creates, its opposite - an antithesis. Thesis and antithesis. The conflict is inevitable.
GID00013370	But the resolution of the conflict yields something new - a synthesis - eliminating the flaws in each, leaving behind common elements and ideas.
GID00013371	The bombs wiped the slate clean. Human civilization descended to a level of ignorance that effectively set our cultural progress back to zero.
GID00013372	The NCR has all of the problems of the ancient Roman Republic - extreme bureaucracy, corruption, extensive senatorial infighting.
GID00013373	Just as with the ancient Republic, it is natural that a military force should conquer and transform the NCR into a military dictatorship.
GID00013374	Thesis and antithesis. The Colorado River is my Rubicon. The NCR council will be eradicated, but the new synthesis will change the Legion as well...
GID00013375	...from a basically nomadic army to a standing military force that protects its citizens, and the power of its dictator.
GID00013376	Here you go.
GID00013377	Sorry, it's not my business to get involved.
GID00013378	All right. At Gomorrah, the bar is always open.
GID00013379	Oh did you now? What business is that of yours, and why the fuck should I care?
GID00013380	[SUCCEEDED] Oh, already? I figured it would be a couple days. Well, let's go meet the lucky lady.
GID00013381	[FAILED] I don't care much about your tastes. Get lost and leave me alone.
GID00013382	Well, look at you! It's so rare I get a volunteer. Yes, let's head to my special room. Follow me, we'll talk there.
GID00013383	Alright, but you're starting to get on my nerves.
GID00013384	Get lost.
GID00013385	I think I should kill you before you have a chance to show those tapes to anyone. What do I have to lose?
GID00013386	[SUCCEEDED] Alright, give me the tapes and I'll leave.
GID00013387	I'm going a long way away from Vegas, but you better hope that you and I never see each other again.
GID00013388	[FAILED] Sorry, but there's no fucking way I'm going anywhere if those tapes aren't with me.
GID00013389	I guess you've made your choice then. Time to die.
GID00013390	[SUCCEEDED] Oh, confident. I like that.
GID00013391	So, what do you want to do with what you've got?
GID00013392	[FAILED] Haha, not too bright, huh? It takes caps, honey, lots of them.
GID00013393	All right, honey. What do you want to know?
GID00013394	Yes?
GID00013395	Yes?
GID00013396	You'd best hold your tongue... friend, or someone here will take care of it, for good.
GID00013397	What do you want to know about those sons of bitches?
GID00013398	I'll see you soon, I'm sure.
GID00013399	Follow me, hon.
GID00013400	Follow me, hon.
GID00013401	Follow me, hon.
GID00013402	Okay. See you soon.
GID00013403	Follow me, hon.
GID00013404	[FAILED] Honey, I've had better than just "good." And you were being so amusing...
GID00013405	Okay, we can have more fun together, but it's not going to be free, hon.
GID00013406	[SUCCEEDED] Oh my, aren't you something else...!? I guess you'll have to see for yourself what I can do, huh?
GID00013407	Consider it "on the house," honey.
GID00013408	[SUCCEEDED] Oh my, aren't you something else...!? I guess you'll have to see for yourself what I can do, huh?
GID00013409	Consider it "on the house," honey.
GID00013410	Fine. Are you ready?
GID00013411	Well... ladies are always a welcome change.
GID00013412	Fine. Are you ready?
GID00013413	Damn shame. Anything else I can do for you?
GID00013414	Damn shame. Anything else I can do for you?
GID00013415	Oh, nothing special, hon. I'm the best lay in Gomorrah, and that's all you need to know.
GID00013416	I like that you're here, doesn't that make you happy?
GID00013417	It's your paradise on this desolate earth, hon. Your troubles are gone, your pain forgotten, and your dreams come true.
GID00013418	Everyone wants a piece of their own personal heaven. So, they come here, for hours... and hours, hon.
GID00013419	Military men, NCR ranchers, wandering travelers... they're all the same without their clothes on. What they want, the Omertas provide.
GID00013420	So you've followed the call of your desires... all the way to the arms of Joana, moi. Now that you've found me, I wonder, do you have what it takes?
GID00013421	Yes?
GID00013422	So, what do you want to do with what you've got?
GID00013423	Consider it "on the house," honey.
GID00013424	Okay, we can have more fun together, but it's not going to be free, hon.
GID00013425	Look, I can't right now. I just want to leave this place and be with Carlitos.
GID00013426	Our terms were clear. Now that you have the Chip in your possession, any attempt to "re-negotiate" payment would be tantamount to blackmail.
GID00013427	Hmm... How shall I put this?
GID00013428	Delivery of the Platinum Chip is non-negotiable.
GID00013429	I invite you to think carefully about what you do next... standing alone before me, surrounded by my heavily-armed Securitron guards.
GID00013430	By the time I was 30 years old, I was a billionaire 30 times over. I founded and ran a vast economic empire.
GID00013431	Do you really think I'm going to let an upstart come into my home and ransom my property to me?
GID00013432	I spent two centuries searching for the Platinum Chip. It's my invention, my property - mine. Now be a good courier and deliver it!
GID00013433	Why, thank you so much. You played that very poorly, you realize?
GID00013434	You're fortunate that I have a certain tolerance for greed. I expect my business partners to be self-interested - but smartly so.
GID00013435	You needn't be afraid of me. It's my Securitrons that are going to kill you.
GID00013436	Not if you've been invited. You realize that you've made quite a splash here in New Vegas?
GID00013437	I can predict with a high degree of confidence that you'll receive an official summons from Caesar. If you haven't already, that is.
GID00013438	I want you to open a hatch in the basement of the derelict weather station atop Fortification Hill.
GID00013439	You'll recognize it on sight. The hatch bears the logo of the Lucky 38, same as the Platinum Chip.
GID00013440	I'm not surprised. The Legion has spies on the Strip.
GID00013441	You have? So you have the means to gain entry?
GID00013442	If you find Caesar's Legion so frightening at this remove, imagine them rampaging across the Strip.
GID00013443	We have a chance to see them detroyed, to see New Vegas become the harbinger of a new age.
GID00013444	This is not the time for Q&A. Kindly hand over the Chip.
GID00013445	This is not the time for Q&A. Kindly hand over the Chip.
GID00013446	I'm not offering you an incentive as crude as money - though there'll be plenty of that.
GID00013447	What I'm offering you is a ground-floor opportunity in the most important enterprise on Earth.
GID00013448	What I'm offering is a future - for you, and for what remains of the human race.
GID00013449	Well enough. We can put the past behind us, I think.
GID00013450	Then this is a waste of time.
GID00013451	A great deal shall be happening - a cascade of events, with you taking a central role.
GID00013452	At the moment, however, all you need to do is take the elevator all the way down to the bottom level. You'll understand soon enough...
GID00013453	A great deal shall be happening - a cascade of events, with you taking a central role.
GID00013454	At the moment, however, all you need to do is take the elevator all the way down to the bottom level.
GID00013455	What you see there will help you understand the significance of what you accomplished at the Fort.
GID00013456	Yes, so far as you've seen, all it does is change the picture on the Securitrons' face screens from policemen to soldiers. But as you'll see...
GID00013457	Some things are more easily shown than told. Take the elevator all the way down to the bottom level, and you'll see what I mean.
GID00013458	Don't worry, you'll like what you see. We have much to accomplish, you and I...
GID00013459	I must insist that you stay long for me to show you that the Platinum Chip does more than change the pictures on the Securitrons' face screens.
GID00013460	Events of great import are about to unfold, with you taking a central role. To get started, all you need do is take the elevator all the way down...
GID00013461	I must insist that you stay long for me to show you what the Chip does. I promise you'll like what you see...
GID00013462	Events of great import are about to unfold, with you taking a central role.
GID00013463	To get started, all you need to do is take the elevator all the way down to the bottom level...
GID00013464	I'm surprised you can still underestimate me after everything you've seen.
GID00013465	I haven't shown my hand - I've shown one card. I've given my enemies a single, provocative datum upon which to fixate.
GID00013466	They have no idea what other cards I'm holding. It's a strong hand, believe me - I dealt it to myself.
GID00013467	Why would I want to go to war against the NCR? They're my best customers.
GID00013468	If their leaders weren't scheming to steal Vegas out from under me, I'd have no troubles with the NCR at all.
GID00013469	No no no, you'll want to hear this out...
GID00013470	Disappointing. In the extreme.
GID00013471	The next step will require you to infiltrate Caesar's camp at Fortification Hill.
GID00013472	You'll have to return to Caesar's camp at Fortification Hill.
GID00013473	Do you have any idea how prodigious is the opportunity you're casting aside here?
GID00013474	Here, take the Platinum Chip again. You will need it.
GID00013475	Upon arrival at the Fort, it's likely that you'll be searched and the Chip taken from you. Don't worry - it will come back to you.
GID00013476	I expect that if Benny doesn't have the Chip, Caesar will make sure you get it. More on that later. Be off.
GID00013477	Something very important. I wouldn't want to spoil the surprise - so don't bother asking.
GID00013478	That's because he ceased to be relevant when you recovered the Platinum Chip. Revenge doesn't interest me, progress does.
GID00013479	Sorry to deny you a moment of primate triumph, but you'll have to go elsewhere to sound your barbaric yawp.
GID00013480	I'll give you time to think over the consequences of what you're saying. I urge you to reconsider.
GID00013481	Feed a man for free, and he'll be back asking for more.
GID00013482	Feed a man a bullet. You won't hear from him again.
GID00013483	Good, bad... The guy with the gun makes the rules.
GID00013484	Time you enjoy wasting isn't wasted time.
GID00013485	The only thing I know for certain is that I don't know nothing.
GID00013486	Longing makes the heart grow fonder, but I've always been a fan of hog-tying my lovers to make sure they can't escape.
GID00013487	[SUCCEEDED] Now you're talking. I suppose I could sleaze it up a bit for their customers if it means I have a non-stop supply of drink.
GID00013488	Tell the Garrets I'm in. I'll make my way there shortly.
GID00013489	[FAILED] I don't need caps that bad. A hard day's labor pays well enough.
GID00013490	I've never been much of a showboat, or cared about being a public figure. I'm plenty content with caps for an honest hard day's work.
GID00013491	What do you have in mind?
GID00013492	I've been around a while. Currently working for the Followers as a gun for hire, but it's getting rather dull.
GID00013493	Aside from protecting them from the occasional thug looking to intercept supply shipments, there isn't much to do around here.
GID00013494	The one researcher I liked who I could chat up about liquor got transferred, and the rest of the docs are pretty uptight about my kind of fun.
GID00013495	And I may have answers.
GID00013496	I joined up looking for a decent-paying job. Granted, the pay is all right, but they won't let me kick back and slog a brew at the end of the day.
GID00013497	They're worried the filthy drunkies in detox seeing me drink will cause an immediate relapse. I say their rehab effort here is just a revolving door.
GID00013498	I've been around long enough to observe patterns of human behavior. Physical and mental anguish are especially exciting to explore.
GID00013499	I'm available, sweetie - but you'll have to do as I say.
GID00013500	Then you'll need to get a room first, sweetie. You're going to want the privacy.
GID00013501	Meet me upstairs. I'll try to leave you in one piece.
GID00013502	Suit yourself. Anything else on your mind?
GID00013503	Goodbye.
GID00013504	I'm honored they would consider me. I'll start immediately.
GID00013505	Santiago is here to please, my prarie flower. Just a few caps and I'm yours.
GID00013506	Santiago is sorry, but you must have a room first. Please see Ms. Garret to procure lodging.
GID00013507	I'll meet you upstairs in a moment, darling.
GID00013508	I will require a hardware and software upgrade to offer enhanced services.
GID00013509	Have a look, baby.
GID00013510	Thank God! I thought I was going to die if you didn't come back soon.
GID00013511	I'm going to head to the Followers' fort to get some rest and detox. You've saved my life, friend.
GID00013512	Thank God! I thought I was going to die if you didn't come back soon.
GID00013513	I'm going to head to the Followers' fort to get some rest and detox. You've saved my life, friend.
GID00013514	[SUCCEEDED] I think you're right. I've been through worse. I'll go to the fort and see if the Followers can watch over me while I recover.
GID00013515	[FAILED] Get the hell out of here. Think you're one of the Followers of the Apocalypse or something?
GID00013516	So far the Crimson Caravan won't cut us a deal. If you can convince them or some other merchant to work with us, I'll discount supplies to you.
GID00013517	You might ask around at Mick and Ralph's - or go see the Garrets, though I suspect they're too busy poisoning Freeside to help it out.
GID00013518	All right. You'll get them at a discounted rate, thanks to all the supplies you've donated.
GID00013519	What seems to be the problem?
GID00013520	Anything else?
GID00013521	That would be a godsend, but so far we've had no luck working out a deal with the Crimson Caravan or any other local merchants.
GID00013522	If you could manage to find someone willing to work with us, I'd gladly offer medical supplies at a discount.
GID00013523	Great! What do you have?
GID00013524	Good to hear! Oh, by the way. I got a shipment of magazines from home I'd be willing to sell if you're interested.
GID00013525	It looks like you took care of our short term supply issues. In thanks, you can have a discount on medical services with me.
GID00013526	Also, I would like to extend an invitation to join the Followers of the Apocalypse.
GID00013527	Your work here in the Old Mormon Fort has been invaluable, and I can't think of a more worthy recruit. Will you join us?
GID00013528	Good to hear! What do you have to donate?
GID00013529	It looks like we've got enough Med-X for the moment, but it always helps to be prepared with a backup supply. How much do you have to donate?
GID00013530	How much do you have to donate?
GID00013531	How much do you have to donate?
GID00013532	We have a good stock of Rad-Away at this point, but every extra bit helps. How much do you have to donate?
GID00013533	How much do you have to donate?
GID00013534	How much do you have to donate?
GID00013535	With your help, we now have a small overstock of Fixer, however, it never hurts to have extra. How much do you have to donate?
GID00013536	How much do you have to donate?
GID00013537	How much do you have to donate?
GID00013538	A common enough problem here in Freeside.
GID00013539	You don't show any signs of physical dependency. Nothing I can do for psychological dependency, I'm afraid.
GID00013540	That's easy enough to clear up.
GID00013541	Who hasn't? But your rad level is nothing dangerous.
GID00013542	This will help you kick the habit.
GID00013543	Anything else?
GID00013544	Hold still. The Rad-Away burns a little.
GID00013545	Thanks! Anything else?
GID00013546	Thanks! Anything else?
GID00013547	Thanks! Anything else?
GID00013548	Thanks! Anything else?
GID00013549	Thanks! Anything else?
GID00013550	Thanks! Anything else?
GID00013551	Thanks! Anything else?
GID00013552	Thanks! Anything else?
GID00013553	Thanks! Anything else?
GID00013554	Thanks for the donation. Every bit goes toward helping Freeside.
GID00013555	I'm honestly pleasantly surprised they would help us out, but I can see Garret isn't doing this out of the goodness of his heart.
GID00013556	Well, it looks like you've earned yourself a discount on supplies now that we'll be fully covered. This supply deal will aid our work immensely.
GID00013557	We're pretty short-handed as it is, but I suppose I could spare a few items.
GID00013558	We don't have a lot right now, but this is what I can offer for sale.
GID00013559	Here is what we have available.
GID00013560	This will help you kick the habit.
GID00013561	Hold still. The Rad-Away burns a little.
GID00013562	If we let everyone run amok, the damn NCR would shut us down. Gotta have some way to regulate usage.
GID00013563	Just a few caps for a good long swig.
GID00013564	You already paid, bub. Get a drink then come back and see me if you still want more.
GID00013565	Sure thing.
GID00013566	Don't get wise. We charge per use, so make that first drink worth the caps.
GID00013567	Anything else you want?
GID00013568	Why, do you work for one of the casinos?
GID00013569	[SUCCEEDED] In that case, yes I do.
GID00013570	Follow me.
GID00013571	[FAILED] All of my guns are special. If anything catches your eye, let me know.
GID00013572	No Vegas-banned items here, buddy. Just high quality standard stock.
GID00013573	Are they looking to buy guns?
GID00013574	Then talk to my partner Ralph.
GID00013575	Let's see you stop me, then. Guys, let's teach these soldier boys a lesson.
GID00013576	Not anymore it isn't. He's not in his right mind if he's even thinking about making a deal with this scum.
GID00013577	What the f-? Get the others! Now!
GID00013578	[SUCCEEDED] I... No. We would never survive. We need to stick together.
GID00013579	I'll go with whatever the King decides, but I'll be watching these NCR scumbags like a hawk. If they try anything...
GID00013580	[FAILED] No, I won't even consider this. We'll show the NCR they can't bully us!
GID00013581	You're going to have to deal with me whether you like it or not. Get them!
GID00013582	We don't have the stills and equipment to supply the amount of meds they're looking to purchase.
GID00013583	You could check with other wasteland merchants, but I think your best bet would be the Atomic Wrangler.
GID00013584	They've got a bunch of stills and a seemingly endless supply of grain alcohol, which could be used as anesthetic or disinfectant.
GID00013585	Then I'm afraid we're going to have ourselves a tussle. Now say what you came to say or get out.
GID00013586	That doesn't sound half bad... what's the catch?
GID00013587	Hmmm, people around here *would* be a lot less ornery if there were more supplies to go around. It'd be rough at first, but I think we could manage.
GID00013588	Tell you what. I'll agree to those terms. But the Kings won't lift a finger until we see the first of those supplies.
GID00013589	That's not so bad. I might have to make an example of a few of the more hotheaded guys, but otherwise, that sounds fair.
GID00013590	Tell you what. I'll agree to those terms. But the Kings won't lift a finger until we see the first of those supplies.
GID00013591	Normally, we don't let outsiders join, but I think I can make an exception in your case. I'll have one of the guys spread the word.
GID00013592	From this day forward, you're one of us, and no one in Freeside will mess with you if they know what's good for them.
GID00013593	In addition, if you want to do something about that hair of yours, talk to Sergio. I'll let him know you're coming.
GID00013594	Perhaps more importantly, you've earned the right to wear something a little more stylish. Here, wear it proudly.
GID00013595	Normally, we don't let outsiders join, and you'd be the first female King ever, but I think I can make an exception in your case.
GID00013596	From this day forward, you're one of us, and no one in Freeside will mess with you if they know what's good for them.
GID00013597	In addition, if you want to do something about that hair of yours, talk to Sergio. I'll let him know you're coming.
GID00013598	Perhaps more importantly, you've earned the right to wear something a little more stylish. Here, wear it proudly.
GID00013599	Sure can. I have a friend who has just what you're looking for, has a shop over yonder by the east gate, named Mick & Ralph's.
GID00013600	Just tell Ralph that I sent you and he'll get you squared away.
GID00013601	Caps are a little tight these days, but with our guards making more and those supplies comin' in I reckon I can spare some.
GID00013602	That's a good idea. I don't give out favors everyday, so you probably shouldn't rush to pick something.
GID00013603	Tumble it around in your mind and come back when you know what you want. I'll be here.
GID00013604	Fine by me, just remember I owe you one. Now what did you want to talk about?
GID00013605	Whoa... that's a doozy. Truth be told, I don't even know if I can pull something like that off.
GID00013606	I'll give it my best. You've earned that much. But this makes us even, you hear?
GID00013607	Damn straight they will. It's some of the other locals that I'm worried about.
GID00013608	On second thought, if I can whip this band of hooligans into obedience, a stray tough guy or two shouldn't be a problem.
GID00013609	Okay, you've got a deal. No more violence against the NCR on my watch. But this makes us even, you hear?
GID00013610	Hold on now, I didn't say I couldn't do it, just that I couldn't guarantee it, and even that's probably stretching the truth a little.
GID00013611	Just leave everything to me. I'll see that the violence stops. But this makes us even, you hear?
GID00013612	Is that so? That's a mighty tall order for someone I barely know. Now, if you were to help me out some, that might change my mind.
GID00013613	Can I help you with anything else?
GID00013614	I'd like to help you out, especially considering all you've done, but that's a pretty big favor you're asking for, and you've already used yours.
GID00013615	Was there anything else you wanted?
GID00013616	Whoa, there. Not just anyone can be a King. First of all, we usually only accept people native to the area.
GID00013617	Second, I have to approve. And I don't. You haven't shown me you've got what it takes to be a King yet.
GID00013618	But if you're fixin' to join something fierce, stick around, and if you play your cards right, things might change.
GID00013619	There you go, all patched up. Anything else I can do for you?
GID00013620	I bet you do, but you won't be getting them from me. I heard about the crap you've been pulling, and I'll not risk my rep for you.
GID00013621	Maybe you didn't hear me the first time. No service for scumbags!
GID00013622	What can I do for you?
GID00013623	I can give you something that should help. I need to see some caps for treatment.
GID00013624	If you were a trooper, I'd tell you to walk it off, but they're your caps.
GID00013625	Yep, you appear to be pretty cut up, but nothing some stitches and pain pills won't cure.
GID00013626	Do you have the caps to cover the pills and treatment?
GID00013627	Hot damn you got whooped good! This could take a while.
GID00013628	I will also require some caps to cover my supplies.
GID00013629	I can take care of that quick and easy, if you've got the caps.
GID00013630	Okay. This will just take a moment.
GID00013631	Okay. This will just take a moment.
GID00013632	Okay. This will just take a moment.
GID00013633	Then what do you need?
GID00013634	Okay. A couple rounds of Rad-Away should do it.
GID00013635	Okay. A couple rounds of Rad-Away should do it.
GID00013636	Okay. A couple rounds of Rad-Away should do it.
GID00013637	Okay. This will just take a moment.
GID00013638	Okay. This will just take a moment.
GID00013639	Okay. This will just take a moment.
GID00013640	Okay. This will just take a moment.
GID00013641	Okay. This will just take a moment.
GID00013642	Okay. This will just take a moment.
GID00013643	Oh? Such things are common in Denver, but I didn't know that other cities had them as well.
GID00013644	I see. That's very strange.
GID00013645	I ask because Caesar once had a similar pet, but it was lost during a battle.
GID00013646	Very well.
GID00013647	When I was a boy, the Legion conquered my tribe. I was chosen for training as a Legionary.
GID00013648	I fought in many battles for the Legion. Eventually, Caesar chose me to lead his Praetorian Guard. It was a great honor.
GID00013649	The girls and women were enslaved, and many of the men and boys were also chosen to become Legionaries. The rest were killed.
GID00013650	We were savages. The Legion raised us up, made us better than what we were.
GID00013651	What did you want to talk about?
GID00013652	The NCR Rangers are the biggest threat. Without them, the NCR is nothing.
GID00013653	We had the numbers, but not the tactics. I know - I was there at Boulder City when we were defeated.
GID00013654	We relied too much on veteran Legionaries for direction and leadership, and the Rangers exploited our weakness by killing our best from afar.
GID00013655	[SUCCEEDED] I guess that's okay. Um, if you're a friend, can you help me?
GID00013656	[FAILED] I'm not allowed to talk to you. Bye.
GID00013657	Okay. Um... do you think you could help me?
GID00013658	Murder? What kind of Murder? Do you have any proof?
GID00013659	Okay, this is a very serious accusation. Please be sure to bring me something concrete.
GID00013660	Well that's something, but I can't go in there without proof of foul play.
GID00013661	These are terrifying. Do you have any idea who the man is speaking on this tape?
GID00013662	Well come back here when you can. I'd like to take care of this as soon as possible.
GID00013663	Come back here as soon as you do, I'd like to see this asshole behind bars.
GID00013664	Clanden? Okay, I'll send some troops over there to bring him in.
GID00013665	All right. Come back in a couple days and I should have it ready for you.
GID00013666	Ok, ask away.
GID00013667	Ha! Are you some kind of machine fetishist or something?
GID00013668	Heh. Well, the only place I know of locally would be Cerulean Robotics, but that place has been overrun by vermin for years.
GID00013669	If you want to check the place out, you can find it on the west side of Freeside. The entrance is on the back side of the building.
GID00013670	Just watch out for thugs. The rats aren't the only vermin you need to worry about.
GID00013671	Anything else I can help you with?
GID00013672	I don't know of any, but if you give me a few days and some caps, I think I could probably make one on my terminal.
GID00013673	Just stop back and see me if you need one made. Anything else I can help you with?
GID00013674	[SUCCEEDED] All right. Come back in a couple days and I should have it ready for you.
GID00013675	[FAILED] I don't think so. I've got a business to run here, buddy.
GID00013676	[SUCCEEDED] All right. Come back in a couple days and I should have it ready for you.
GID00013677	[FAILED] That is just an insult to my expertise. My work is worth more than that.
GID00013678	[SUCCEEDED] All right. Come back in a couple days and I should have it ready for you.
GID00013679	Not yet. Come back later and it should be ready to go.
GID00013680	Yep, here you go. You'll need to use a terminal to upload the data to the robot.
GID00013681	Just stop back and see me if you need one made. Anything else I can help you with?
GID00013682	I don't know of any, but if you give me a few days and some caps, I think I could probably make one on my terminal.
GID00013683	Then I must refuse. The people here have the right to do what they want and are beholden to none. I won't take that away from them.
GID00013684	And whose job is it to stop it? Yours? Mine? Who are we to tell people what to do? No man has that right.
GID00013685	Says the one with a squad of armed soldiers behind them. No, I don't think a peaceful solution is possible. Not anymore.
GID00013686	That I don't want to sign away my freedom and that of all the people I'm responsible for at gunpoint? Yeah, I'm sure.
GID00013687	[SUCCEEDED] Honestly, I hadn't thought it through that far. I'd guess someone would come and take over this place.
GID00013688	And you can be damn sure they won't run it like the King, baby. They might run everyone out, or enslave them, or worse.
GID00013689	I guess I have no choice. Tell your NCR masters that I accept their terms. I'll see that violence against their people is dealt with.
GID00013690	Now take these fools and get out of here before they start a riot.
GID00013691	[FAILED] My momma didn't raise no quitter, and I stand by my beliefs. The answer is no.
GID00013692	And I'm trying to protect mine. If the NCR wants peace so much, the first step would be to get these soldiers out of here.
GID00013693	An offer, huh? All right, let's hear it.
GID00013694	Wrong, huh? And I suppose they sent all of these soldiers just to make nice. Lucky me.
GID00013695	Then I suggest you make your way back outside. My men have orders to shoot anyone caught sneaking around in sensitive areas.
GID00013696	You say Crocker sent you? Let me see... I just received a memo regarding him recently and haven't had a chance to read it in detail.
GID00013697	Ah, the matter with the so-called Kings. Crocker's been wringing his hands while good people die for too long, and now the matter's fallen to me.
GID00013698	Unlike the good ambassador, I don't intend to blink. Tell the leader of this gang to stand down or face annihilation.
GID00013699	That is his choice. If he chooses the latter, a squad of my men will be there to back you up. Any questions?
GID00013700	You know, I just received the strangest memo about Freeside. It said that Colonel Hsu has already dispatched a squad to take care of the problem.
GID00013701	I'll let Hsu's men deal with things, but the good ambassador is going to learn a harsh lesson regarding protocol.
GID00013702	I trust you can find your own way out.
GID00013703	Good. When the task is done, report back to Crocker. My men have other orders and will return here on their own to make their report.
GID00013704	Dismissed.
GID00013705	Do you have any idea what our current situation is? As we speak there is a huge army of madmen not ten miles from here waiting to kill us all.
GID00013706	We don't have the luxury of long-term diplomacy any longer. Anyone that could prove a hindrance in the battle to come must be dealt with swiftly.
GID00013707	You have your orders. I expect you to carry them out.
GID00013708	Dismissed.
GID00013709	Not exactly. Give them the chance to do the right thing at least. Personally, I doubt they'll do it.
GID00013710	Crocker's been making overtures to these savages for months and gotten nowhere. Expect a fight, but don't look for one.
GID00013711	Dismissed.
GID00013712	Yeah?
GID00013713	We breed them, mostly, but sometimes we get some good ones from Denver. That whole city is overrun with them.
GID00013714	Okay.
GID00013715	Been doing it since I was a boy. The mongrels know to listen up when I start talking to them.
GID00013716	Piss off, kid. We've got no more business to conduct.
GID00013717	Everything. Up until recently, this man was an employee of mine. He's quite handsome, don't you think?
GID00013718	I know I did. We became... close. I warned him that I was a very jealous woman, and he said he understood.
GID00013719	Apparently he didn't. Last week, I chanced upon him in Gomorrah, being serviced by one of their two-cap whores. I was not pleased.
GID00013720	I tell you all this because I want you to know that this man means a great deal to me.
GID00013721	Let me guess. The NCR couldn't get me to dance to their tune so now they're asking again a little less nicely, right?
GID00013722	We'll deal with that should the time come, Pace. Now I'm sure these gentlemen are as anxious to get out of here as we are to see them go.
GID00013723	Let me guess. The NCR couldn't get me to dance to their tune so now they're asking again a little less nicely, right?
GID00013724	Sounds like he's not going to cooperate, men. Open fire!
GID00013725	And you. Bringing these assholes in here like you're doing us some kind of favor.
GID00013726	You can take your new friends and get the hell out of here, because the answer is no. The Kings will never deal with trash from the NCR.
GID00013727	I can't believe what I'm hearing. You're actually going to make a deal with these guys?
GID00013728	Pace, this is an opportunity we can't pass up. They're finally recognizing us. This is what we've been fighting for.
GID00013729	Like hell it is. This goes against everything we stand for. Everything you supposedly stand for.
GID00013730	I'm not going to listen to them just because they throw a few crumbs my way, and a lot of the guys feel the same way.
GID00013731	Please leave me alone. I have nothing more to give.
GID00013732	It's just about closing time. Let's go see the boss about getting paid.
GID00013733	Oh, I'm going to need the rifle and armor back. Boss's orders.
GID00013734	Good. Look around and get a feel for where customers and risks can enter and exit the area while I get your gear ready.
GID00013735	Mr. Soren, please get to the point. The second half of your payment is late and I want to know why.
GID00013736	Ms. Van Graff, my associates and I have decided that we wish to renegotiate the terms of our deal.
GID00013737	Might I ask for what reason? The shipment was delivered. The guns were tested before leaving this facility.
GID00013738	Regardless, we feel that the quality of the weapons is below expectation, and hoped to adjust the price accordingly.
GID00013739	Ah, I think I understand what the issue here is. Excuse me for a moment, would you?
GID00013740	Jean-Baptiste, could you bring out the volunteer?
GID00013741	W-What is this, Ms. Van Graff?
GID00013742	This is a lesson, Mr. Soren. A lesson in faith.
GID00013743	I don't understand. Who is this man? What does this have to do with our deal?
GID00013744	Do it.
GID00013745	Never break faith with the Van Graffs, Mr. Soren.
GID00013746	I expect you'll have the rest of our payment ready tomorrow morning.
GID00013747	Okay everyone, show's over. Back to work!
GID00013748	Ha ha, I think he wet himself before he left. That was pretty good making up that part about sleeping with Jacob.
GID00013749	You did make that part up, right, Glory?
GID00013750	Damn it, girl, what has mama always said about tipping the help? I thought this was about him stealing money from us.
GID00013751	He was stealing money, though he could have kept it for all I cared. God knows he earned it.
GID00013752	The pump is property of The King. You'll need to pay if you want a drink.
GID00013753	Who isn't in trouble in New Vegas, uh? Sooner or later, you hit the bottom of the barrel - I just happened to fall harder than most, is all.
GID00013754	I am just one more loser that got the evil-eye from Lady Luck - hard fall. Now I lay at the bottom and keep to myself.
GID00013755	All right. About what do you want to know?
GID00013756	From the top! Where else, uh? I am Carlitos - my fingers work the magic and my hands deal the luck!
GID00013757	There was no player who'd stood a chance, no wiseguy who didn't fear me, and no doll who could resist me. Gomorrah was my kingdom, Carlitos' turf!
GID00013758	Yeah, I could've ended buried in the sands with just my head sticking out. Ants love that - a riot, know what I mean?
GID00013759	This place has come a long way. Sarah takes care of it and she lets me stay, for now.
GID00013760	Yeah, I could've ended buried in the sands with just my head sticking out. Ants love that - a riot, know what I mean?
GID00013761	This place has come a long way, but ever since Sarah's death it is not the same.
GID00013762	All right. What do you want to know?
GID00013763	If you're smart, the Strip's all flash and noise. If not, luck's your dame, your hot date, until you find she's a cheap whore high on Jet.
GID00013764	Ha! There's only one important player in town, and that's Mr. House. Everyone keeps clean around him, the families, the barons - fuck, even the NCR.
GID00013765	My recommendation, get the fuck out of town while you can. It'll leave you hanging in the wind or, worse, add your body to a concrete wall, okay?
GID00013766	Hey, you're smart. Okay, it was like finding diamonds in your vodka and showgirls under your card-table. You want it, Gomorrah has it.
GID00013767	It was heaven - until you find that all the glitter is made of broken dreams and all the praise hides a knife pointing at your ribs.
GID00013768	I didn't just spend time there, I lived there, okay? I was family. All I wanted, I had. Caps, booze, drugs, women, power, you name it.
GID00013769	It was heaven - until you find that all the glitter is made of broken dreams and all the praise hides a knife pointing at your ribs.
GID00013770	Now, if you have to ask, you probably don't know shit about who you're dealing with, huh? Listen up - watch out for Cachino, that's all I'm saying.
GID00013771	I'd recommend you save your caps and your skin. Check The Tops - no big time wiseguys there. Freeside's also fun, you know?
GID00013772	There's too much shit and despair at Gomorrah already. I don't want anybody making it worse for Jo... for the girls, you know?
GID00013773	What doesn't she do, huh? Sarah makes this hole look like a palace - damn nice pair of gams on her too. She never walks outside, though.
GID00013774	Because Mr. House ripped this place to shreds before filling it with concrete. Hey, I was untouchable once, but Mr. House's a god - you got that?
GID00013775	I... Okay, it's Joana. She... works at Gomorrah. But it's all my fault! I met her at the Atomic Wrangler - beautiful doesn't even come close.
GID00013776	I moved her into Gomorrah. I was in love, okay? Then Cachino, backstabbing snake, got me out of the way so that he could have my girl.
GID00013777	No dice. I already opened my trap more than I should. Walls have ears even all the way down in this hole, you know? Can't trust nobody.
GID00013778	You know - straightening up bets, Gomorrah, success, women, all that shiny stuff.
GID00013779	This place has come a long way. Sarah takes care of it and she lets me stay, for now.
GID00013780	This place has come a long way, but ever since Sarah's death it is not the same.
GID00013781	It was heaven - until you find that all the glitter is made of broken dreams and all the praise hides a knife pointing at your ribs.
GID00013782	What about Joana?
GID00013783	[FAILED] Ha ha ha! Okay, okay... stop or I'll choke, I swear. Listen, kid - I'll cut you some slack because nothing else in this town will, you hear?
GID00013784	What, you think I can just waltz in there and take her away? She's their doll now, okay?
GID00013785	Besides, I step in Gomorrah and I'm as good as dead, you hear? You don't just leave the Omertas unless it's in a body bag.
GID00013786	He's a cunning bastard, Cachino. Told Nero and Big Sal he caught me spring cleaning my tributes to the family - can't do nothing against that viper.
GID00013787	Don't know... She's a dream to me now... If I, I mean if I could have her again I'd be a made man.
GID00013788	Why am I even scared of Cachino and all those fuckers? Joana and I are dead anyway if we don't get the hell out of here.
GID00013789	Okay, you try that and let me know. How she looks, what she's wearing, she's safe, anything - I'll pay you, you hear?
GID00013790	Have you made up your mind?
GID00013791	Don't know... She's a dream to me now... If I, I mean if I could have her again I'd be a made man.
GID00013792	Why am I even scared of Cachino and all those fuckers? Joana and I are dead anyway if we don't get the hell out of here.
GID00013793	Okay - you try that and let me know, okay? How she looks, what she's wearing, she's safe, anything - I'll pay you, you hear?
GID00013794	Have you made up your mind?
GID00013795	Deal! Come back with news soon, you hear?
GID00013796	Dammit! You're going to leave me hanging, uh? Don't know how else I can get her back.
GID00013797	Deal! Come back with news soon, you hear?
GID00013798	Dammit! You're going to leave me hanging, uh? Don't know how else I can get her back.
GID00013799	Hey, that's great. What's going on?
GID00013800	That won't do... at all. Listen, it can't be the jet, Cachino's got her scared shitless.
GID00013801	Find a way to make this work... please.
GID00013802	She is...? Listen, no time to waste. Help her get to Freeside, that's our ticket out of this fucking city.
GID00013803	I'll meet you there between midnight and dawn, though we could use some backup. We only got one chance to get this right, you hear?
GID00013804	These guys in Freeside, good shots, right? They owe me big time. Tell'em that Carlitos' back to collect his chips, they'll know what do.
GID00013805	Deal! Come back with news soon, you hear?
GID00013806	Clanden, under the authority of the New California Republic, I place you under arrest for murder.
GID00013807	What? Are you fucking kidding me? You can't do this, the Omertas aren't going to stand by and let you arrest me.
GID00013808	The Omertas have no say in this matter. This is a legal matter now. You'll have to come with us.
GID00013809	Alright. I'll come quietly, but this fucked.
GID00013810	What the fuck are you trying to pull here? Where is my girl? Now I'm gonna have to kill your sorry ass.
GID00013811	Ok little lady, let's get started. You look like a tough piece of meat, I'm going to enjoy tenderizing you.
GID00013812	<Talks about their reason behind visiting New Vegas>
GID00013813	<Talks about her home>
GID00013814	<Talks about Heck Gunderson>
GID00013815	<Talks about being a rancher>
GID00013816	<Talks about Walter's plans>
GID00013817	<Ethel's goodbyes>
GID00013818	He's got his reasons. And when that man gets a notion stuck in his head, he's like a Bighorner bull that's seen red.
GID00013819	And if it means Heck Gunderson's involved, then you better step aside before the stampede tramples you over.
GID00013820	It's not my place to say much, Walter thinks this is a man's job. I swear, I won't see the day he'll get over that Heck Gunderson.
GID00013821	Oh, a good ways west of here, in a place you've never been. Far as we concerned, only name it ever had was "Phebus Ranch."
GID00013822	That was before we lost some land to Heck Gunderson. The bank demanded payment in full the day after the Stockmen's Association bailed it out.
GID00013823	If that's what you want to talk about, go see Walter. He'll talk your ear off.
GID00013824	Everything he says about the evils of Heck Gunderson is true, but I've never held the notion that fighting evil with evil carries the world forward.
GID00013825	I'm done talking about that man. If that's what you want, step on over to Walter.
GID00013826	A good life if you don't mind hard work. The only real fuss is the constant bother with varmints.
GID00013827	Fail to catch Molerats early in their breeding, and you'll have three or four head breaking their ankles in Molerat holes every day.
GID00013828	Of course, the worst varmint at all is a Brahmin Baron with his hands in the pockets of a Republic senator.
GID00013829	That's a problem you can't solve with a Varmint Rifle, though I fear my husband's apt to try. He's got Heck Gunderson in his sights right now.
GID00013830	All right, goodbye.
GID00013831	That's very kind of you. Maybe this'll be the dawn of a new day.
GID00013832	I'm not surprised. You don't see folks rushing to help each other around here.
GID00013833	I don't suppose you have the magic powers necessary to bring my husband to his senses, do you?
GID00013834	He swears he won't leave this godforsaken city until he's seen Heck suffer. So far as I can see, we're the only ones in pain.
GID00013835	As I was saying, I'd be grateful if you could convince Walter to give up this doomed crusade of his.
GID00013836	[SUCCEEDED] Sharp eyes on you, all right. We've gone through a heap of trouble to get in town. Ethel says I just need to wet my throat.
GID00013837	A drink? Nonsense. All I need right now is to settle a score. We didn't come a long ways just to stroll our best clothes around.
GID00013838	[FAILED] A drink? Nonsense. All I need right now is to settle a score. We didn't come a long ways just to stroll our best clothes around.
GID00013839	I got some time - what's eating you?
GID00013840	All right, kid! Be good.
GID00013841	Okay. What'd you want know?
GID00013842	I know it better than my wife's corset! What about it, kid?
GID00013843	I hear you. What's on your mind?
GID00013844	There's a long list of grievances that Heck Gunderson's got to answer for, kid. I'm here to make sure that "rancher" stops stealing our lands.
GID00013845	If he ain't chiseling behind your back, he just sends his men, ready for a fight. Then you either "sell" your ranch for a penny or you're dead.
GID00013846	I'm tired of being trampled over, kid, and I got a good mind to stop Heck once and for all.
GID00013847	I came to take care of Heck Gunderson. That bastard's taking over any ranch he spots in The Wasteland.
GID00013848	You have? What are you waiting for, kid? Spill the beans!
GID00013849	Steeling our pure-breed resolve, that's how! We've faced the Wasteland right in the old mug and told her to shove it!
GID00013850	Listen, we own these lands, and I'll be damned if the NCR, those Legion bastards, or anyone else tries to walk all over us.
GID00013851	Listen, we own these lands, and I'll be damned if the NCR, those Legion bastards, or anyone else tries to walk all over us.
GID00013852	A ransom? I doubt that snake's got enough soul to care that much for his own youngin. Besides, what's to stop him after his son's returned?
GID00013853	Nah, Heck only knows greed and pain, kid. It's high time he got paid back in kind. His life, or his son's, either way I win.
GID00013854	[SUCCEEDED] I'll pay that much and die a happy man when my time comes. So, we got a deal?
GID00013855	[FAILED] Cut that in half and we got a clean deal, kid.
GID00013856	I hear you. What's on your mind?
GID00013857	Darn far it is, our ranch. Ethel would be happy to yap about that - I got more important things in mind, kid.
GID00013858	Bighorners' my trade since I was a youngin. I confess it's hard living these days, kid. The Wasteland ain't the same anymore.
GID00013859	What more you want? He's a slithering snake, what he is. One of the biggest landowners this side of the Colorado and it's all stolen, I tell you.
GID00013860	All that money buys him any NCR senators he wants - scoundrels, like Heck. There's just no way for us small folks to get by, much less prosper, kid.
GID00013861	Sure, kid, and I still hump like a buck in Spring. That Gunderson's a liar and born of a viper, I swear.
GID00013862	I have no illusions that he'll ever stop his plundering. So I'm just going to make him suffer, that's what I'm going to do.
GID00013863	Here, in town, he's got few of his armed men to protect him. I just got to find out what's he up to and then I'll know where to hit him hard.
GID00013864	Like I said, kid. Someone's got to rein that greedy son of a gun.
GID00013865	I'll be damned! You mean the young Gunderson? That's a shave tail if I ever saw one - he's got less sense than a Brahmin at a crossroads.
GID00013866	I'd not be one to complain if he got lost for good, kid... If it makes Heck suffer then I'm all for it.
GID00013867	Where I come from, we appreciate good intentions. I reckon you could help me figure out what's he doing in town.
GID00013868	Tell you what, that chiseler's blowing hot air at that over there fancy casino - The Ultra-Luxe. Find out what's his story here, will you?
GID00013869	[FAILED] Cut that in half and we got a clean deal, kid.
GID00013870	Where I come from, we appreciate good intentions. I reckon you could help me figure out what's he doing in town.
GID00013871	Tell you what, that chiseler's blowing hot air at that over there fancy casino - The Ultra-Luxe. Find out what's his story here, will you?
GID00013872	All right, kid! I appreciate it. I hope to see you soon.
GID00013873	[SUCCEEDED] All right, kid! I'm taking a liking to you. It's a deal.
GID00013874	Where I come from, we appreciate good intentions. I reckon you could help me figure out what's he doing in town.
GID00013875	Tell you what, that chiseler's blowing hot air at that over there fancy casino - The Ultra-Luxe. Find out what's his story here, will you?
GID00013876	That's okay, kid. I understand - let me know if you change your mind, will you?
GID00013877	All right, kid! I appreciate it. I hope to see you soon.
GID00013878	All right, kid! I appreciate it. I hope to see you soon.
GID00013879	We are honest folk out there, damn hard to make a living in the desert, kid. Heck's a different breed, goddamn thief he is.
GID00013880	Scaring us into giving away our lands is all he's done to strike it flush - comes packing iron and none can hold a candle to his men - bad blood.
GID00013881	Ethel's going to be madder than a wet hen but you reap what you sow, kid, and Heck's earned every ounce of misery he gets. So, we have a deal?
GID00013882	[SUCCEEDED] You'll leave me drier than tumbleweed, kid, but I reckon anything I can do to get back at Heck is well worth the expense.
GID00013883	Ethel's going to be madder than a wet hen but you reap what you sow, kid, and Heck's earned every ounce of misery he gets. So, we have a deal?
GID00013884	[FAILED] Cut that in half and we got a clean deal, kid.
GID00013885	Ethel's going to be madder than a wet hen but you reap what you sow, kid, and Heck's earned every ounce of misery he gets. So, we have a deal?
GID00013886	I won't hold it against you, kid. You got to do your clean thing, I respect that.
GID00013887	Darn far it is, our ranch. Ethel would be happy to yap about that - I got more important things in mind, kid.
GID00013888	Bighorners' my trade since I was a youngin. I confess it's hard living these days, kid. The Wasteland ain't the same anymore.
GID00013889	I'll be damned! You mean the young Gunderson? That's a shave tail if I ever saw one - he's got less sense than a Brahmin at a crossroads.
GID00013890	I'd not be one to complain if he got lost for good, kid... If it makes Heck suffer then I'm all for it.
GID00013891	Kid, look around you, there's poison and death everywhere, and people like Heck are responsible for the misery we suffer.
GID00013892	What right do they have to continue with their mischief and killing, huh?
GID00013893	Good work. I'm sorry that stupid mail-order cowboy ended like that but his father's misery makes it well worthy.
GID00013894	This deserves a good compensation, kid. How does that sound?
GID00013895	Hahaha! Yeeeehaw! Now, that's something I thought I'd never hear.
GID00013896	This deserves a good compensation, kid. How does that sound?
GID00013897	All right, kid! Be good.
GID00013898	All right, kid! Be good.
GID00013899	All right, kid! Be good.
GID00013900	All right, kid! Be good.
GID00013901	All right, kid! Be good.
GID00013902	I hear you. What's on your mind?
GID00013903	So, Ted's nowhere to be found and Heck's quite unprotected while looking for him, huh?
GID00013904	Hell, it sounds like the perfect time to get even. Heck won't know what hit him, what do you say?
GID00013905	That's what we said. So, do we have a deal?
GID00013906	That's what we said. So, do we have a deal?
GID00013907	That's what we said. So, do we have a deal?
GID00013908	That's what we said. So, do we have a deal?
GID00013909	Both Gundersons, gone? I'll be damned, you are one of a kind!
GID00013910	This deserves a good compensation, kid. How does that sound?
GID00013911	All right, kid! Be good.
GID00013912	[FAILED] Same, the right of might, kid. The Gundersons will pay for all their crimes and that's final.
GID00013913	[SUCCEEDED] Hell, a good thrashing is what I want to give them but I see your point, kid. Things will never change without us good folks.
GID00013914	All right, I'm going to get Ethel far away from this damned city and head back home. There's a worthy life waiting for us there.
GID00013915	Thanks for your help, kid. So long!
GID00013916	It just so happens a position opened up recently. It's not much, but it'll be a good way for me to gauge your potential for future assignments.
GID00013917	It just so happens a position opened up recently. We currently need another body to guard the entrance outside. Think you can handle that?
GID00013918	Ran out of caps, eh? The job's still available, if you're interested.
GID00013919	You're in luck. We've interviewed a few people for the courier position, but they all seem so... untrustworthy. Ready to make some money?
GID00013920	And? Don't leave me in suspense. What was their reaction?
GID00013921	Wonderful. I already have a man outside who can show you the ropes and get you set up. His name is Simon.
GID00013922	He's been with the family for years, so listen to what he says, and follow his instructions.
GID00013923	Suit yourself. Was there anything else you wanted?
GID00013924	Not at all.
GID00013925	Yes it is. My brother and I run this particular branch, but our family has operations all over, particularly in California.
GID00013926	Look around, and you'll notice two things.
GID00013927	First, we don't lack for security. I'm not worried about anyone breaking in here or stealing our goods.
GID00013928	Not that we don't occasionally have attempts, but even those prove useful. Do you know how much target dummies cost?
GID00013929	Back to my point, the second thing you'll notice is that we do not sell cheap merchandise. Everything here is second-to-none.
GID00013930	People who buy Van Graff goods typically don't care where they have to go to get them.
GID00013931	This place is certainly lively, that's for sure. Did you want to know something specific about it?
GID00013932	Oh, there's not much to tell. I was born into a big family and don't get along with my parents, so here I am. As far away from them as possible.
GID00013933	Unfortunately, I found someone else with a little more experience, and he'll take over the position starting tomorrow.
GID00013934	However, another task has come up that I could use some help with, assuming you're still interested in making some money?
GID00013935	You basically let every jackass off the street march in here. That doesn't say much for your judgement.
GID00013936	Still, you did manage to prevent that psychopath from blowing this place up. That deserves some reward, at least.
GID00013937	Then you robbed me of my revenge on that prancing asshole of a King. For that alone, I should kill you.
GID00013938	You kept away the undesirables, patted down the rest for weapons, and kept your cool.
GID00013939	That is to say, you performed as instructed. Simon was impressed, and so am I. So you get a small bonus with your normal pay.
GID00013940	You had a little bit of a hard time following instructions, but didn't do too bad overall. Here's your pay.
GID00013941	There's a deal that we've been working on for a while now and the buyer would like a sample of our weapons.
GID00013942	I need you to run a package out to a discrete location that the client has chosen. Sound good?
GID00013943	Well, look who doesn't need my money any more. When you find your pockets a little lighter, stop back.
GID00013944	It's a courier job, so it should be easy caps.
GID00013945	Good, here's the package. I'll mark the location on your map. The buyer said they'd be in town for quite a while so there's no rush.
GID00013946	That said, try not to dawdle. This client could mean big money for us, which naturally means big money for you.
GID00013947	Very well. Let me know if you change your mind. The buyer said they'd be in town for quite a while, so there's no rush.
GID00013948	My men have their hands full with our other operations, so unless I can find another courier, the job will still be available.
GID00013949	Good... good. Here's your payment. If you'll excuse me, I have some thinking to do.
GID00013950	Oh, Jean-Baptiste was talking about a matter earlier that he needs help with. I volunteered you. See him for the details.
GID00013951	It's better if you don't ask. Now I believe I asked you a question. What was their reaction?
GID00013952	All right then. If we're going to work together, there's only one thing you need to know about me. I like things simple.
GID00013953	Recently Glory negotiated a deal between us and a big time player. We're talking more caps than you'd probably see in a lifetime.
GID00013954	Your part in this is simple. To finalize this deal, I need to tie up a loose end. To do that, there's a girl I need you to find.
GID00013955	No, no, no. That's not how it works. You don't get to weigh the options. You're either in or you're out.
GID00013956	Yeah, sure fucking thing. I'll be waiting with baited breath for your schedule to clear up, ha ha.
GID00013957	Well, no time for pleasantries. I've got your gear right here, but let's see if you can follow instructions.
GID00013958	You'll be covering the other side of the door there. Take your position while I get your stuff out.
GID00013959	You can always tell a rookie. You look too eager. Give the job a few hours, and the shine'll come right off.
GID00013960	I've been paired with worse, I guess. Anyway, let's see if you can follow instructions.
GID00013961	Good choice. I prefer laser-based weapons myself, but the boss lady said she wants at least one guard using a plasma rifle.
GID00013962	Says the lightning bits draw in more people. Whatever.
GID00013963	Now that you're equipped, a quick word on the job at hand. In a nutshell, we're here to keep the riff-raff away.
GID00013964	Drunks, punks, and capless vermin are to be turned away. Potential customers are to be permitted normal entrance.
GID00013965	That is, after we pat them down for weapons. An unarmed man is a lot less likely to try to steal something with several armed guards around.
GID00013966	Don't start any fights. I don't care if some Jet junkie just insulted your mother, we're here to promote violence elsewhere, not start it here.
GID00013967	Lastly, don't abandon your post. We're getting paid to stand next to this door, not talk to someone down the street or head to the casino.
GID00013968	That goes double for any thoughts of splitting with that gear. Every now and then some young punk thinks he can run off with Van Graff property.
GID00013969	Trust me, the rifle and armor are nice, but they're not worth your life.
GID00013970	Other than that, relax. There's usually some eye candy coming and going from the Wrangler over there at some point, so the view's not too bad.
GID00013971	Other than that, relax. Who knows, you might attract a high roller from the Wrangler over there and never have to pull a gig like this again!
GID00013972	Nothing wrong with going plasma. Just make sure you hit what you're aiming at.
GID00013973	Lasers have a high rate of fire, but not a lot of stopping power. Plasma on the other hand is slow as a mule, but with a kick to match.
GID00013974	So what'll it be?
GID00013975	I'm inclined to agree, but it's a slum with NCR citizens in it, and as such it falls under my jurisdiction.
GID00013976	Violence is something of a way of life there, but there's been a disturbing rise in the number of attacks on our people lately.
GID00013977	More worrying is the fact that our sources suggest the violence is being perpetrated by the gang that runs the place, the Kings.
GID00013978	I need someone to look into this that won't attract attention. Would you be interested?
GID00013979	It's a beastly place. Poverty is rampant, and all that goes with it - drugs, alcohol abuse, the usual.
GID00013980	You'd remember this one. It's a pit where people are robbed, murdered, or simply go to die.
GID00013981	Good. Our men have come up with two different plans for seeing an end to the violence.
GID00013982	First, our sources have tracked most of the attacks back to a King named Pacer. The consensus is that the violence will stop if he's removed.
GID00013983	The problem is that we can't simply kill him. In the current climate, the NCR would likely be blamed for his death.
GID00013984	There is an alternative option, but my sources feel that getting rid of this Pacer fellow is our best shot.
GID00013985	That's too bad. Come back if you change your mind. I'm sure you can see yourself out.
GID00013986	Make it look like an accident, or pin the deed on someone else. Look into this guy's affairs, and I'm sure you'll find something you can use.
GID00013987	Either kill Pacer in a way that doesn't lead back to us, or talk the King into quelling the violence. It's not really that hard to remember.
GID00013988	In any case, I expect to hear good news about this in the future. Keep me informed of your progress.
GID00013989	See, that's exactly the type of information we can use. In fact, that's perfect. Those fancy weapons the Van Graffs peddle aren't exactly common.
GID00013990	It goes without saying that actually getting the Van Graffs to do the deed would be the ideal solution.
GID00013991	However, if Pacer were killed with either a laser or plasma-based weapon, everyone would automatically assume the Van Graffs did it.
GID00013992	Still, unless you want several dozen armed men at your throat, you'd have to kill him without being seen. Be careful.
GID00013993	I'll leave the method up to you. However, there is an alternative if you'd rather try to handle things without bloodshed.
GID00013994	That could be useful, but I'm afraid I don't have the background to know how to take advantage of that knowledge.
GID00013995	[SUCCEEDED] Remind me never to get on your bad side. If that's true, then yes, that would be a suitable way to get rid of him.
GID00013996	However, it would involve gaining access to his personal drug stash and tampering with it unseen, which might pose a challenge.
GID00013997	[FAILED] I doubt it. I've seen junkies live for decades on the stuff. You'd be better off asking someone who knows about these things.
GID00013998	Damn it, I'm an ambassador, not a doctor. You'll have to find some other way.
GID00013999	I'm afraid I can't be much help in this matter. My specialty is people and politics, not medicine.
GID00014000	In that case, we can take a different tack, but one that I at least have more experience with - diplomacy.
GID00014001	If we can't go after the man responsible, we'll simply appeal to the man above him.
GID00014002	The Kings, including our friend Pacer, report to the leader of their gang, a man who calls himself the King.
GID00014003	I'm sure something will turn up. If you think you've found something but are unsure, report back and I'll let you know if it's something we can use.
GID00014004	It may be tough to find a way to completely throw off suspicion, however.
GID00014005	I'm not a violent man myself, so I had our guys come up with an alternate solution on the off chance that our agent-to-be shared my sentiments.
GID00014006	Reward? You want a reward for setting our diplomatic efforts back a year?
GID00014007	Oh, I see. You're proud of your efforts, eh? Bah! Thankfully, it looks like we won't be working together any longer.
GID00014008	At least you've got the sense to know you've screwed up. I'll probably be cleaning toilets by the end of the week. But you'll be busy, too.
GID00014009	If it will get you out of my hair, this is a small price to pay. At least I won't have to put up with you any longer.
GID00014010	That's an understatement. Still, there's nothing to be done about it now. Maybe the violence may die down once things settle.
GID00014011	Here, take this. It's not what I was planning to give you, but you deserve some sort of payment for your efforts. Oh, and one other thing.
GID00014012	You better believe I'm mad. You've waged a one man campaign to drag our good name through the mud and I'll be held accountable!
GID00014013	You probably don't even know what I'm talking about. Gah! This is what I get for hiring an idiot to do such an important job.
GID00014014	Here, just take this and go. I have damage control to do.
GID00014015	Wait, I'm supposed to send you to Colonel Moore up at Hoover Dam, though why she wants to see an imbecile like you is beyond me.
GID00014016	So go to Hoover Dam and see Colonel Moore. Got it? Hoover Dam. Colonel Moore. Maybe it's time to retire.
GID00014017	See, that's exactly the type of information we can use. In fact, that's perfect. Those fancy weapons the Van Graffs peddle aren't exactly common.
GID00014018	It goes without saying that actually getting the Van Graffs to do the deed would be the ideal solution.
GID00014019	However, if Pacer were killed with either a laser or plasma-based weapon, everyone would automatically assume the Van Graffs did it.
GID00014020	Still, unless you want several dozen armed men at your throat, you'd have to kill him without being seen. Be careful.
GID00014021	I'll leave the method up to you. However, there is an alternative if you'd rather try to handle things without bloodshed.
GID00014022	That could be useful, but I'm afraid I don't have the background to know how to take advantage of that knowledge.
GID00014023	As I told you before, that could be useful information, but I don't know how to take advantage of it.
GID00014024	Killing two birds with one stone. Excellent. You've done a great service for the NCR.
GID00014025	Now, you're probably wondering about your reward. This has been something of a hot button topic, so I was able to secure this for you.
GID00014026	[SUCCEEDED] Well, I don't officially have access to any more funds, but here. This is from me personally. There's more coming your way, too.
GID00014027	[FAILED] I'm sorry, but those are the only funds I was able to allocate. You'll have to make due with it. Besides, you may have other tasks soon.
GID00014028	Good show. With the conditions there, no one will suspect anything other than bad drugs to be the culprit. You've done a great service for the NCR.
GID00014029	Now, you're probably wondering about your reward. This has been something of a hot button topic, so I was able to secure this for you.
GID00014030	How unexpected! I was sure a direct confrontation would lead to more fighting, but I'm delighted to be proven wrong.
GID00014031	I wouldn't be surprised if you had something to do with the situation not flaring up, either. Here, I'm sure you deserve every one of these caps.
GID00014032	Also, Colonel Moore has requested your presence at Hoover Dam again. No doubt she has further work for an individual with your skillset.
GID00014033	I'm afraid I don't have any further assignments that would suit you, so you should probably go see her at your earliest convenience.
GID00014034	I've received a message from Colonel Moore up at Hoover Dam. She's been following your exploits and has requested that you meet with her.
GID00014035	You're not officially in the employ of the NCR, so there's nothing forcing you to go, but I'd go see her sooner rather than later.
GID00014036	The Colonel is not someone you want to keep waiting.
GID00014037	I would, but I'm afraid the rest of the work in my queue pertains to matters I'll have to deal with personally. You do have another option, however.
GID00014038	That's great to hear. He's got a lot of sway in Freeside, so we can expect a dramatic drop in violence soon.
GID00014039	Now, you're probably wondering about your reward. This has been something of a hot button topic, so I was able to secure this for you.
GID00014040	That's most unfortunate. In this circumstance I've been instructed to send you along to Colonel Moore over at Hoover Dam for further orders.
GID00014041	The Colonel will likely send you back to Freeside with a squad of armed men, for all the good that will do.
GID00014042	I understand. Sometimes these things take time.
GID00014043	Remember, do what you can to gain the man's trust. Then you'll have your chance.
GID00014044	Oh, I like the Colonel just fine. She's a good soldier, one of the best. I just don't think her general approach to things is a good fit here.
GID00014045	See, the Colonel likes to solve things neatly, quickly, and efficiently, through a show of force if possible, and through actual force if necessary.
GID00014046	That won't work here. Unless she plans on killing half the population of Freeside, sending soldiers to the area will only make things worse.
GID00014047	More like instigate a mass riot. People there already think the NCR is trying to take this place over. We'd only be confirming their fears.
GID00014048	I completely agree. Even if a riot didn't immediately break out, a line will have been crossed, and we'll have made that many more enemies.
GID00014049	I'd suggest you speak to Colonel Hsu over at Camp McCarran. He's much more level-headed about this sort of thing.
GID00014050	He's also in a better position to bargain with the people of Freeside, seeing as how he's in charge of water and power distribution in the area.
GID00014051	Still, I'm only mentioning it as an option. My official orders are to direct you to Colonel Moore. Godspeed.
GID00014052	Wait a moment, if you would. While sending you to Colonel Moore is what I'm officially supposed to do, I'd like to propose an alternative.
GID00014053	Is it that obvious? You must understand that while Colonel Moore's job is to get things done, my job is to represent the NCR's best interests.
GID00014054	I was afraid this would happen. Freeside will be a little more dangerous for a while, but eventually things will die down.
GID00014055	I expect few people will purposely target NCR citizens for some time to come, which is a relief.
GID00014056	However, the NCR's reputation has taken a huge blow because of this. People are beginning to see not much difference between us and the Legion.
GID00014057	I've been authorized to give you this for your efforts. It's not much, but most of the funds for this operation are now going toward damage control.
GID00014058	Good, good. Hsu's a man you can count on to handle a crisis. I'm just glad that things didn't end in violence.
GID00014059	Here, this is what remains of the funds initially allocated for this operation.
GID00014060	Also, I've been directed to send you on to Colonel Moore at Hoover Dam. She's been following my reports on your exploits with some interest.
GID00014061	As I don't have any further assignments for you, I'd recommend going to see her if you need more work.
GID00014062	That's terrible. I suppose the violence against our people will stop, though.
GID00014063	I'll have to spend much of the remaining funds for the operation on damage control, but I can spare this much as compensation for your efforts.
GID00014064	If that's what you prefer, I won't stop you. Just remember to try to find a way to do it that doesn't lead back to the NCR.
GID00014065	If it just doesn't look possible to make the kill without drawing attention, don't forget there's always the diplomatic approach.
GID00014066	[SUCCEEDED] Remind me never to get on your bad side. If that's true, then yes, that would be a suitable way to get rid of him.
GID00014067	It looks like you have things well in hand, so I'll leave you to it.
GID00014068	[FAILED] I doubt it. I've seen junkies live for decades on the stuff. You'd be better off asking someone who knows about these things.
GID00014069	Damn it, I'm an ambassador, not a doctor. You'll have to find some other way.
GID00014070	I'm afraid I can't be much help in this matter. My specialty is people and politics, not medicine.
GID00014071	No doubt Colonel Moore's approach will produce results. Just be ready to duck when the bullets start flying.
GID00014072	He's caucasian, in his mid-30s, and extremely charismatic. It's that last part that we're counting on.
GID00014073	The Kings are a bunch of young hoodlums who aren't inclined to listen to anyone, except him. Get him on our side, and the rest will fall in line.
GID00014074	Go and talk to the King, try to convince him to put an end to this violence. Pacer's a punk, but he won't likely disobey a direct order.
GID00014075	The King might not be open to the idea at first, so you may have to ingratiate yourself with him. Do whatever it takes.
GID00014076	When it's done, one way or the other, report back here and we'll take it from there.
GID00014077	I wish you luck. If you run into some difficulty and think you'd rather just take the shot with Pacer, that's fine too.
GID00014078	I trust that Hsu will deal with the matter thoughtfully. Regardless, stay on your toes. There's no telling what will happen.
GID00014079	Well then don't waste any more time here. Get going!
GID00014080	Hey! Be careful, I don't like people hurting my patients.
GID00014081	Enough! You were supposed to be helping them. It's best if you just leave now.
GID00014082	You killed him! What kind of Doctor are you? Get out of here now!
GID00014083	With business booming like it is and considering I'm the only person with medical experience in the camp, I could perhaps use a hand.
GID00014084	Do you have any medical experience?
GID00014085	I heard Private Stone turned himself in for stealing my medical supplies. You have my thanks.
GID00014086	Are you willing to look into this for me?
GID00014087	So you've found out what's happening with the supplies?
GID00014088	What would you like to know?
GID00014089	Excellent job. Where did you learn how to do all that? I don't think that I could have done much better myself. Very impressive.
GID00014090	As for the men, they'll recover soon and be back on the front lines in no time. Ahh... the circle of life.
GID00014091	I'll send word to Major Polatli about your work here. Once again, you have my sincerest thanks.
GID00014092	Not too bad, at least you didn't kill anyone.
GID00014093	They'll recover soon and be back on the front lines in no time. Ahh... the circle of life.
GID00014094	I'll send word to Major Polatli about your work here. Thanks.
GID00014095	[SUCCEEDED] Excellent. As you can see, we have a lot of injured troopers here and I haven't had time to look at all of them yet.
GID00014096	Since you have some medical experience I'd like you to examine them and see what you can do to treat them.
GID00014097	Excellent. As you can see, we have a lot of injured troopers here and I haven't had time to look at all of them yet.
GID00014098	Since you have some medical experience, I'd like you to examine them and see what you can do to treat them.
GID00014099	Without any medical experience, you're not going to be much use to me in here.
GID00014100	However, you can take this status report back to Major Polatli. It's a very important task and I think I can count on you.
GID00014101	Is that so! I'll have to talk to Major Polatli about this right away.
GID00014102	I appreciate you doing this for me. Here's a little something for your trouble, it's not much, but it's all I can spare.
GID00014103	Let me know when you do find something out.
GID00014104	That's too bad. These men really needed those supplies.
GID00014105	Thanks for looking into this, I appreciate it even though you didn't find anything.
GID00014106	That's too bad, but at least you didn't start hacking and slashing with a knife. I don't think Major Polatli could handle two doctors like that.
GID00014107	I'll send word to Major Polatli.
GID00014108	Thanks for your help. I'll take it from here.
GID00014109	I'll send Major Polatli word about the situation here.
GID00014110	You weren't much help, but thanks anyway... I guess.
GID00014111	I'll send Major Polatli word about the situation here.
GID00014112	[FAILED] Ahh... I see. Unfortunately you're experience with "medicology" isn't going to be any use to me here.
GID00014113	Just take this status report back to Major Polatli. That's all I need from you.
GID00014114	With the Legion defeated, things are great now.
GID00014115	Things are better now that the Legion at Nelson have been defeated.
GID00014116	We're doing okay for the time being. Not as many serious injuries lately.
GID00014117	If I was a mortician, business would be booming. As a Doctor, business is hard. Too many injuries that I can't do anything about.
GID00014118	The Legion has been hitting us pretty hard lately. Lots of casualties, not many people I can save.
GID00014119	What would you like to know?
GID00014120	Men have waged war on each other for countless centuries. Now is no different.
GID00014121	People fight and die for what they believe in. I'm just here to patch them up so they can go on their merry way. Do no harm and all that.
GID00014122	Someone with medical experience, I take it? It's not the best, but it does the job.
GID00014123	I just wish I had the equipment and supplies to handle the number of injuries we have here.
GID00014124	To make things worse, I think someone might be stealing my supplies.
GID00014125	I'm doing the best I can considering the poor situation I find myself in.
GID00014126	There's barely enough equipment or medicine to handle the number of injuries we have.
GID00014127	To make things worse, I think someone might be stealing my supplies.
GID00014128	Sometimes it does feel that way. I feel more like a mortician than a doctor.
GID00014129	Often I just don't have the resources to handle the number of injuries here.
GID00014130	To make things worse, I think someone might be stealing my supplies.
GID00014131	The simple fact that I no longer have as many supplies as I should. I've been careful with them and I should have more than what remains.
GID00014132	Unfortunately, I don't have the time to go searching for the missing supplies since I have my hands full with injured soldiers.
GID00014133	Anything is possible, but that's unlikely.
GID00014134	Unfortunately, I don't have the time to go searching for the missing supplies since I have my hands full with injured troopers.
GID00014135	I may have my hands full here, but I'm anything but careless.
GID00014136	Unfortunately, I don't have the time to go searching for the missing supplies since I have my hands full with injured troopers.
GID00014137	That's an odd response if I've ever heard one.
GID00014138	Unfortunately, I don't have the time to go searching for the missing supplies since I have my hands full with injured troopers.
GID00014139	That would definitely be appreciated. You might want to ask around and keep an eye out for anything suspicious.
GID00014140	I store a variety of drugs here, but it looks like my supply of Hydra is diminishing rather quickly.
GID00014141	Locked in a cabinet, here in the medical tent. I'm around most of the time, but I can't keep a constant watch on them.
GID00014142	I remember coming in one morning and noticing that my supplies were lower than they should have been.
GID00014143	I thought it might have been a mistake, but another morning I noticed the same thing.
GID00014144	The camp is pretty dead at night, especially at 0200 hours when the guard shift changes. That'd be a good place to start looking.
GID00014145	Perhaps you can come back and help me when you have more time.
GID00014146	Okay then, what would you like to talk about?
GID00014147	So the Major has you running errands for him. Well, we're short on personnel as well as supplies so we'll take all the help we can get.
GID00014148	Not good. If we don't get more supplies, we're going to have to start using dirt for food and sticks and rocks for weapons.
GID00014149	Hey, how'd you like to do something for me?
GID00014150	Better now that all those Legion troops in Nelson are dead. The NCR might actually have a chance of kicking their asses after all.
GID00014151	Things are still pretty damn rough, but we're keeping it together.
GID00014152	I take it my men were dead. It's a high price to pay, but these supplies will save a few lives here.
GID00014153	Thanks for finding these. You should check in with the Major, he'll want to know about this.
GID00014154	Damn it all... I sent some men out to get these supplies, but they never returned. I guess the Legion got them on their way back.
GID00014155	At least we have the supplies. It's not much, but every little bit counts.
GID00014156	Thanks for finding these. You should check in with the Major, he'll want to know about this.
GID00014157	Me? I've been doing this shit for far too long and have been in too many battles to remember.
GID00014158	Still... this has got to be one of the worst situations I've been in. Not too much I can do about it but do my job and do it right.
GID00014159	Have you changed your mind? Are you willing to help me out with something real simple?
GID00014160	I want you to collect NCR dogtags from our fallen troopers. That way I can keep track of who's gone and how to reallocate our supplies.
GID00014161	Suit yourself. Let me know if you change your mind.
GID00014162	Hey, you've been a big help. I wanted to give you something for helping me out. It's not much, but here you go.
GID00014163	Good work. If you find any more, you know where to find me.
GID00014164	It's easy. Just bring back any NCR dogtags you find and I'll try to make it worth your while.
GID00014165	What do you want to know?
GID00014166	Bad? I've been doing this a long time and I haven't been in many places that were worse than this.
GID00014167	We've been out here on the front lines for a long time without any reinforcements or resupplies. That's what I need your help for.
GID00014168	I sent some troops out to find more supplies, but they never returned. I need you to track them down and help them bring back the supplies.
GID00014169	Is that a joke? Have you looked around? Massive casualties, constant raids, barely any food or equipment... does that sound alright to you?
GID00014170	Shit, we haven't had a proper resupply since god knows when. Last time I sent troops out to find supplies, they never returned.
GID00014171	The Major sent you because we don't have any men to spare. So why don't you make yourself useful and find those troops and supplies for me.
GID00014172	The Major let me send out some troops to gather supplies, but unfortunately they never returned. I'm guessing they ran into some trouble on the way.
GID00014173	You can help by finding the troops and assisting them in bringing back any supplies they found.
GID00014174	I sent them to HELIOS One to see if they had any supplies they could spare. They've got to be somewhere between here and there.
GID00014175	I'd try searching the main road, or checking with the men at HELIOS One to see if they know anything.
GID00014176	It's dangerous, but not as bad now that we've taken back Nelson from the Legion.
GID00014177	Of course it's dangerous! Damn Legion raiding parties have been giving us hell ever since they took over Nelson.
GID00014178	Hell, my men probably got ambushed by a raiding party! But we need those supplies, and we need them badly.
GID00014179	Make it quick, I don't have time to stand around talking all day long.
GID00014180	We really need those supplies, so don't take your sweet time finding them.
GID00014181	No, can't say I do. I've got my own problems to worry about.
GID00014182	I'm short staffed and I don't have the time to take care of some issues around the camp.
GID00014183	I need someone to talk to a few of the officers and help them resolve some of the problems around here.
GID00014184	I've got the Legion at Nelson breathing down my neck and not enough men or supplies to get this camp into fighting shape so we can strike back.
GID00014185	I need someone to talk to a few of the officers and help them resolve some of the problems around here.
GID00014186	If I can get this place in order, then I can focus our efforts on taking back Nelson from the Legion.
GID00014187	And the more that gets done around here, the more resources I'll be able to put into assaulting Nelson.
GID00014188	Good, let's not waste time then. Our biggest problems right now are supplies and troops, and the Legion is draining us of both.
GID00014189	Quartermaster Mayes has been complaining to me nonstop about the lack of supplies, but unfortunately we aren't getting a resupply any time soon.
GID00014190	I want you speak with him and see if there's anything you can do for him.
GID00014191	I'll be here if you change your mind.
GID00014192	Not really, but we don't have much choice. If you help out more around the camp I could spare some additional men for the battle.
GID00014193	We have a decent amount of men, but it'll be a close battle. If you help out more around the camp, I could probably spare some additional troops.
GID00014194	We've been reinforced fairly well, thanks to your help. I'd say the odds are in our favor.
GID00014195	However, if you help out a little more around the camp, we'd be in a good enough position to send our best men to help retake Nelson.
GID00014196	Thanks to your help, we have more than enough men to take those Legion bastards.
GID00014197	Well, with that over with and the Legion forces at Nelson defeated, we finally have some breathing room.
GID00014198	Now we can actually try to strengthen our forces along the river and prepare for the upcoming battle at Hoover Dam.
GID00014199	With the help you've given us, we're doing a little bit better, but we still have the Legion forces at Nelson to deal with.
GID00014200	If we can retake Nelson, that will be a huge help to our efforts in this area and give us an advantage at Hoover Dam.
GID00014201	The Legion forces have been reinforced and are looking pretty strong. It's going to be a tough fight.
GID00014202	The Legion forces are hurting pretty bad, actually. This is the perfect opportunity for us.
GID00014203	Reports have the Legion forces at Nelson sizable, but not insurmountable.
GID00014204	I heard. The extra supplies will help for a short time, but that only solves one of our problems.
GID00014205	With all the Legion raids lately, we're running low on troops that can still fight. Some are injured, but even more are dead.
GID00014206	I want you to check in with Dr. Richards and see if he needs any help getting our troops back on the front line.
GID00014207	I heard from Dr. Richards. Too bad you weren't able to help him with anything, but we all can't be doctors.
GID00014208	I heard from Dr. Richards and I wouldn't call what you did helping. We need all the men we can get on the frontline.
GID00014209	I heard from Dr. Richards. I'm glad you were at least some use to him.
GID00014210	Dr. Richards said you did a good job in there. That's mighty high praise coming from him.
GID00014211	Excellent. Killing the Legion commanders in Nelson will severely cripple the Legion forces and allow us to take back the city.
GID00014212	Meet up with Sergeant Cooper just outside Nelson. He will assist you in reclaiming Nelson.
GID00014213	Come back when you're ready.
GID00014214	Are you ready?
GID00014215	The initial reports have come back already. Excellent work. This will buy us a lot of breathing room to get back on our feet here.
GID00014216	Now we can actually try to strengthen our forces along the river and prepare for the upcoming battle at Hoover Dam.
GID00014217	You have my thanks, we owe you a lot.
GID00014218	I'd like to give you something to thank you for helping us.
GID00014219	Missing medical supplies? No, uhh... I don't know anything about that.
GID00014220	My problem? My problem is we're all going to die.
GID00014221	The Legion may be gone from Nelson, but there's still a whole fucking army of them out there.
GID00014222	Today... tomorrow... it doesn't matter, we're all going to die in this war.
GID00014223	So why don't you just leave me alone.
GID00014224	My problem? My problem is we're all going to die.
GID00014225	We're out of food, we're out of men, and we're out of time. The Legion is right outside waiting to kill us all.
GID00014226	Today... tomorrow... it doesn't matter, we're all going to die here.
GID00014227	So why don't you just leave me alone.
GID00014228	You kidding me, man? How are things? They're all fucked up, that's how things are!
GID00014229	Everyone is either starving or dying out here. Left out to dry by the rest of the NCR. Fuck this place.
GID00014230	I'd rather be anywhere else but here.
GID00014231	Here you go. Thanks, I owe you big time.
GID00014232	Fine. Be like that.
GID00014233	[SUCCEEDED] What?! Oh shit... how the fuck?! Oh man, I'm in some deep shit now.
GID00014234	Look, I can explain everything! Really, just give me a chance to explain!
GID00014235	[FAILED] No, no that's not necessary. I'm fine. Just a little stressed out, that's all.
GID00014236	Uh... look, it's not what you think. I can explain everything, if you'll just hear me out.
GID00014237	Uh... yeah, sure, no problem.
GID00014238	Have you looked around? Have you seen what's going on here? What we're going through?
GID00014239	This place is hell. I've seen my all my friends butchered by the Legion in front of my very eyes. I can still hear their screams at night.
GID00014240	All I wanted was a little escape, so I took some drugs to help me do that. Is that so bad?
GID00014241	Hey look, I just wanted to forget about all this stuff happening around here for a little while, that's all!
GID00014242	What happens now?
GID00014243	But it sure as hell is going to make me feel better for a little while, and that's all I wanted.
GID00014244	So what happens now?
GID00014245	I... uh... I never... I never thought about that.
GID00014246	But look, I needed this. I needed to escape for just a little while. I needed this...
GID00014247	So what happens now?
GID00014248	Yeah, see... I just needed to escape for a little while. To not think about all this stuff going on here.
GID00014249	So what happens now?
GID00014250	I knew you wouldn't understand! You haven't been here! You haven't been through all the horrors that we go through every day!
GID00014251	So what are you going to do about it?
GID00014252	Haven't you heard anything I've said?! Don't you understand?!
GID00014253	Hey, maybe I can change your mind. I still have some drugs left over. They're all yours if you let me go.
GID00014254	What? You want me to turn myself in?
GID00014255	Why the hell should I do that?
GID00014256	Alright. Here, I'll give you some of what I stole, just don't mention this to anyone.
GID00014257	What? Hey sure! You got a deal. Thanks, I owe you big time.
GID00014258	[FAILED] No. That's not going to happen.
GID00014259	The Chief? But, he's a legend! I guess if he's got a plan behind it all, who am I to question it? I won't say a word about it to anyone else.
GID00014260	What, you mean you're not part of the act? Heh. Sorry. Thought you were the heckler Garret hired to spice up the shows.
GID00014261	Whoa Nelly! There's insult comedy and then there's psycho comedy! I guess you aren't the heckler Garret hired to spice up my show. What do you want?
GID00014262	Come on, stay in character! You're supposed to be heckling me!
GID00014263	[SUCCEEDED] Hey, not bad! Your timing's terrible and you got no style, but you might make it as a professional heckler.
GID00014264	[FAILED] That doesn't even make any sense! You're not the heckler Garret hired to spice up the show, are you?
GID00014265	So, what do you want, then?
GID00014266	Yeah, no, we were hoping to find someone who was actually... what's the word... funny? What do you want, kid?
GID00014267	I'm not suirprised, he's a stubborn, greedy bastard.
GID00014268	What's on your mind?
GID00014269	Hell, what ain't the trouble with the Legion? This time, they jumped the camp in Nelson while the troopers were setting up
GID00014270	Captured a bunch of gear and took the town. Couple of troopers too. Got 'em crucified down near the center of town.
GID00014271	You're one of them "special" folks, ain't you? They ain't... real snakes, see? They're Legion soldiers.
GID00014272	I just called 'em snakes because they're low down and sneaky. Like a snake.
GID00014273	Anyway, we always have trouble with the Legion 'round here. This time, they jumped the camp in Nelson while the troopers were setting up.
GID00014274	Captured a bunch of gear and took the town. Couple of troopers too. Got 'em crucified down near the center of town.
GID00014275	Eesh, is my act that bad, or are you just that dumb? Yeah, that's right - got me a nice, juicy contract with the management.
GID00014276	Either you need to get your eyes checked or that "fame is fleeting" thing is true - and since I happen to be world famous, you must be going blind.
GID00014277	Name's Hadrian. Bet you never saw a ghoul in a suit before, huh? Course, you don't exactly strike me as the worldly type.
GID00014278	Too bad I got this ironclad contract with the Garrets. They'll never let me out of it.
GID00014279	Like I told you, I can't go anywhere without getting out of my contract with Garret first. Talk to him, maybe he'll cut me loose if you ask nice.
GID00014280	Really? You mean I'm finally out of this shithole? That's great! Thank you!
GID00014281	Sure, why not? Nothing left for me here since Garret's dead.
GID00014282	Later.
GID00014283	Jeez, some people....
GID00014284	All right, but make it snappy, this isn't exactly a lucrative career enterprise here.
GID00014285	If you believe my mother, since she first laid eyes on me. First thing she said was "Boy! That's a funny-looking kid!"
GID00014286	I guess I got a face only a mother could love, because nobody else would give me the time of day.
GID00014287	Maybe you can help me, see, I can never tell when it's lunchtime.
GID00014288	Yeah? Hey, you're all right! Tell him I'll do it for a hundred a night! No! Fifty! No, twenty! Ten!
GID00014289	Just don't rob me, and I'll do it!
GID00014290	Hey, I'm just happy to get any kind of work I can.
GID00014291	That's exactly my point, kid. Exactly my point.
GID00014292	Woof! If you're not the most sarcastic fella I ever met, your standards are so low they could use you at the Annual Gomorrah Saucy Limbo Competition.
GID00014293	As the bar!
GID00014294	Woof! If you're not the most sarcastic dame I ever met, your standards are so low they could use you at the Annual Gomorrah Saucy Limbo Competition.
GID00014295	As the bar!
GID00014296	A break's better than a shot - less chance of lead poisoning. Hey, if you know any gigs hiring, I'll work cheap. Real cheap. I'll take peanuts!
GID00014297	Hey, now, come on! I prefer the term "outdoor entertainment bonanza." Besides, have you seen the caps whores make in this town? I should be so lucky!
GID00014298	[SUCCEEDED] Whoa, geez, what was I thinking? You're right, I oughta go in there with a cool head, tell him how much I'm really worth.
GID00014299	[FAILED] Look, I appreciate the vote of confidence, but you don't know what it's like.
GID00014300	They offer me a roof over my head and half a Fancy Lad and I'll fold like a classy napkin.
GID00014301	Sweet daisies, here I come!
GID00014302	Hey, okay, but don't take too long, I don't want to miss this!
GID00014303	[SUCCEEDED] All right, you drive a hard bargain, baby. Tell you what, I'll bump him up to 3,000. That's fair. Here's your cut.
GID00014304	[FAILED] Baby, you have got to be joking! Now take your cut and stop being crazy.
GID00014305	Any day, baby, any day.
GID00014306	[SUCCEEDED] All right, you drive a hard bargain, baby. Tell you what, I'll bump him up to 3,000. That's fair. Here's your cut.
GID00014307	[FAILED] Baby, you have got to be joking! Now take your cut and stop being crazy.
GID00014308	Any day, baby, any day.
GID00014309	That comedian you mean? Yeah, he practically begged me to hire him. Didn't even haggle.
GID00014310	[SUCCEEDED] All right, you drive a hard bargain, baby. Tell you what, I'll bump him up to 3,000. That's fair. Here's the difference for your cut.
GID00014311	[FAILED] Baby, you have got to be joking!
GID00014312	Oh, well, that's all just a big misunderstanding, see.
GID00014313	Mr. Bishop, well, he owed me a lot of money, and, y'know, he's a busy guy, so I sort of figured I'd just...take it off his hands.
GID00014314	You don't know Mr. Bishop. He's not like the other bosses up there. He knows the Wasteland like the back of his hand, and he likes to wander it.
GID00014315	I knew if I didn't get way the hell away from New Reno, he'd run me down like a dog.
GID00014316	They already have that pig McCaffery working for them. Do they need another guard?
GID00014317	Still trying to convince me, huh?
GID00014318	Are you uncomfortable? My servos may require adjustment.
GID00014319	Excellent. Awaiting further orders.
GID00014320	Numbness will subside in several minutes. Awaiting further orders.
GID00014321	That will be 10 caps, please.
GID00014322	I am sorry, but you must procure a room first. Please return when you have lodging arranged.
GID00014323	Thank you. I will meet you in your room.
GID00014324	Servos active!
GID00014325	Very well. Please return if you require further service.
GID00014326	You did? Hot damn! I been looking for one of those for years!
GID00014327	For my customers, I mean... I'm not into that kind of shit.
GID00014328	It is? It will? My god! Imagine the possibilities!
GID00014329	It didn't happen to come with an owner's manual, did it? Aw, forget it - trial and error should do it.
GID00014330	Looks like that gives us a full roster of new ass to sell. Good work - enjoy the bonus.
GID00014331	}It is? It will? My god! Imagine the possibilities!
GID00014332	It didn't happen to come with an owner's manual, did it? Aw, forget it - trial and error should do it.
GID00014333	It is? It will? My god! Imagine the possibilities!
GID00014334	It didn't happen to come with an owner's manual, did it? Aw, forget it - trial and error should do it.
GID00014335	Looks like that gives us a full roster of new ass to sell. Good work - enjoy the bonus.
GID00014336	It is? It will? My god! Imagine the possibilities!
GID00014337	It didn't happen to come with an owner's manual, did it? Aw, forget it - trial and error should do it.
GID00014338	[SUCCEEDED] Hey, I'm amazed you even found the thing in the first place.
GID00014339	Here is double for your trouble. Those freaky fetishists ought to be satisfied now.
GID00014340	[SUCCEEDED] Hey, I'm amazed you even found the thing in the first place.
GID00014341	Here is double for your trouble. Those freaky fetishists ought to be satisfied now.
GID00014342	[FAILED] I don't think so. We agreed to a price, and that's what you're getting.
GID00014343	[SUCCEEDED] You're right, you're right! Something like this, it's worth a little extra because it's going to keep on satisfying you...
GID00014344	Those disgusting fetishists, I mean. Something wrong with someone if they got to fuck a machine.
GID00014345	[SUCCEEDED] You're right, you're right! Something like this, it's worth a little extra because it's going to keep on satisfying you...
GID00014346	Those disgusting fetishists, I mean. Something wrong with someone if they got to fuck a machine.
GID00014347	[FAILED] Believe me - these things is a mess of trouble to keep maintained! They wear out on you, at the worst possible moment!
GID00014348	So say those disgusting fetishists, anyway. Something wrong with someone if they got to fuck a machine.
GID00014349	All right.
GID00014350	No, sir. I'm an independent trader from Arizona.
GID00014351	No, ma'am. I'm an independent trader from Arizona.
GID00014352	Not at all - they're my best customers. As long as you don't try to sell 'em chems or alcohol, they treat you fair.
GID00014353	Hell, I don't even need to travel with guards most of the time in Legion territory. All the bandits are dead or run off.
GID00014354	Between having to hire protection and getting slapped with taxes, it's more profitable to stick to Arizona and New Mexico.
GID00014355	But, I do cross the river from time to time when an opportunity comes along.
GID00014356	Okay.
GID00014357	What do you want to know?
GID00014358	Three years and counting. If I could just get across the river, I'd be free. Not that I'd try it - I've seen what happens when you get caught.
GID00014359	All right.
GID00014360	A small town in New Mexico. The Legion burned it a few years back - that's how I ended up here.
GID00014361	Routine active. Please return later.
GID00014362	Exterminate!
GID00014363	The Legion's got a major crossing point down at Cottonwood Cove, so we keep an eye on them from up here.
GID00014364	If McCarran would send us some more men, we could do more than watch.
GID00014365	Sorry, it's just... you look like his type, y'know? You got that hard-ass wasteland explorer thing going on.
GID00014366	Please, no!
GID00014367	"Robbed" is such an ugly word. It's more like I took care of a payroll problem for him.
GID00014368	Also, I might have... umm... sort of... plowed his daughter. A little.
GID00014369	I figured it might take him a while to understand his accounting error and cool down a little.
GID00014370	Also, I might have... umm... sort of... plowed his daughter. A little.
GID00014371	Sure.
GID00014372	Thanks, but if Bishop finds me and I don't have his money, my balls are going to be on his trophy wall.
GID00014373	I guess I don't. That's why I'm here.
GID00014374	Thanks.
GID00014375	You'd do that? Great! I really appreciate that!
GID00014376	Son, where I come from, a man doesn't just walk up to another man and offer him a job without even knowing him. What's your game?
GID00014377	Darling, where I come from, a lady doesn't just walk up to a man and offer him a job without even knowing him. What's your game?
GID00014378	Like I said, I got no reason to take your charity. Not till I know you better.
GID00014379	Hmm.... Maybe it's time to give these tired old bones a rest. All right, show me what you've got.
GID00014380	Yeah this is Clanden, this guy is one sick motherfucker. The way I see it you have a few options.
GID00014381	Maybe you could use what's on these tapes to get him by himself, or maybe you could use them to leverage him out of the casino.
GID00014382	I figured you might have that problem. That guy is pretty much a mystery. I did some asking around about him, on the down-low of course.
GID00014383	Turns out the bosses' plans are right fucked without him. Killing him would probably work wonders, just don't let anyone see you do it.
GID00014384	Cachino? Yeah I've heard the name. Not sure why he'd send you to me, is he helping out with room service or something?
GID00014385	All kinds of business, most of it is ours.
GID00014386	I'll show you what I have, but if it doesn't rock my world then we're going to have a long talk.
GID00014387	Hunting and killing, plain and simple.
GID00014388	Bingo. Now if you're done asking stupid questions, I have more important things to do.
GID00014389	Yes, sir. Fisto reporting for duty.
GID00014390	Please assume the position.
GID00014391	Yes, ma'am. Fisto reporting for duty.
GID00014392	Please assume the position.
GID00014393	I am programmed for your pleasure. Please assume the position.
GID00014394	Fisto will report to the Atomic Wrangler for further orders.
GID00014395	Servos active!
GID00014396	Yes, sir!
GID00014397	Yes, ma'am!
GID00014398	Allright! I won't turn down a freebie. Shit, these days I almost can't pay my own in this two-faced, goddamn city any more.
GID00014399	[SUCCEEDED] Ha ha! - damn straight! This is about the last place in this fucking city where I can burrow without having to look over my shoulder.
GID00014400	[FAILED] Shit, not even down this rat-hole can I drink in peace? I don't need no friends. I just need you to get the fuck out of my sight.
GID00014401	And I want a cute patron of this shit-hole to blow me over the pool-table, but that ain't happening either, is it?
GID00014402	I'm in - ask.
GID00014403	Good riddance.
GID00014404	Until next round.
GID00014405	[SUCCEEDED] Hey... I'm just worked up, okay. You're tough, right? You won't care about my stupid rambling then?
GID00014406	Uh-huh. Sorry stranger, just not sure I trust that kind of charity from somebody I don't even know.
GID00014407	Well, at least you're honest, I guess. Sorry, I just don't take charity from strangers.
GID00014408	Much obliged to you, friend.
GID00014409	[SUCCEEDED] I suppose it's only right you get a little something for your troubles. Here - my daddy left me this gun. Guess I don't need it no more.
GID00014410	[FAILED] I'm sure Mr. Torini already took care of your fee. Maybe you ought to talk to him. Much obliged for the opportunity, friend. See you around.
GID00014411	No apologies needed, friend - I'm sure there's somebody out there'll appreciate my singing.
GID00014412	Just about my whole life, ever since my daddy left ma and me and went off to roam the wastes.
GID00014413	Long time ago, now. I never even knew him. Ma always said he was a mysterious feller, always traveling on in secret.
GID00014414	Looking for a story, huh? All right, what can I tell you?
GID00014415	Well, I was born in a little town out Montana way. Me and Ma didn't have much, ever since my pa up and left.
GID00014416	Anything else you'd like to know?
GID00014417	That he did. Never did know why. Ma always said he was a real mysterious feller, even when he was with her. Like he was a stranger sometimes.
GID00014418	Maybe that's how you was raised, but where I come from a man does right by his wife and child or he ain't no kinda man at all.
GID00014419	No sir, I'm 28. Why?
GID00014420	Maybe. Maybe I just never felt like I belonged back home.
GID00014421	Maybe he did, maybe he didn't, but that don't change the fact that it wasn't right.
GID00014422	It sure wasn't easy. Ma worked her fingers to the bone to make sure we had enough to survive, and I worked the coal mines from when I was fifteen.
GID00014423	After Ma died, I guess I wanted to find my Pa and get some answers from him. Been out here looking ever since, but he ain't an easy man to find.
GID00014424	I suppose there's that, but a man oughta know his own Pa, and a woman oughtn't have to work herself to an early grave to provide for her family.
GID00014425	After Ma died, I guess I wanted to find my Pa and get some answers from him. Been out here looking ever since, but he ain't an easy man to find.
GID00014426	Can't say as I really know. Maybe I'll just ask him why. Maybe I'll punch him right in the mouth.
GID00014427	Hell, the more I talk about it, the more the whole damn thing sounds like a dumb idea.
GID00014428	Maybe I will. Or maybe I'll just ask him why he left. Hell, the more I talk about it, the more the whole damn thing sounds like a dumb idea.
GID00014429	Maybe I should. Don't suppose you know anyplace a feller with a guitar might find a job, huh?
GID00014430	Ah well. It was worth a shot.
GID00014431	There's an intruder in the dish hut! Get over there and kill whoever it is, you fools!
GID00014432	Two of the players, Troike and Clanden, have some problems that need to be solved. Ask them what they need.
GID00014433	We have two contractors, a guy named Troike and one named Clanden. They've both been running into some issues.
GID00014434	The plan is called Racket, but that's all the info you're going to get out of me right now.
GID00014435	We call it Racket, and it is going to show Not-At-Home and every other fucker in our business just what the Family can do.
GID00014436	What's on your mind?
GID00014437	Okay, let's chat.
GID00014438	Alright, come back any time.
GID00014439	Come find me when you have something you need to say.
GID00014440	I heard, we'll be needing those guns. Word on the street is you handled those Fiend freaks like a real pro.
GID00014441	Yeah, I heard. I wasn't sold on the whole gas thing. He's the expert though. It sounds like this chlorine thing is going to work out real well.
GID00014442	I heard you did some good work for us. Thank you. Here's a little cash from us to you. Try not to spend it all in one place.
GID00014443	As one of our captains, Cachino was kind of like a project manager. He made sure people had what they needed to get their jobs done.
GID00014444	Cachino was my Man Friday. He took care of what needed to be taken care of. Had no idea what a dumb son of a bitch he was.
GID00014445	A little bit of this, and a little bit of that.
GID00014446	I'm a close friend of some of the Family around here. I do some independent contracting around the casino, and they set me up with this great room.
GID00014447	Oh, that's great. I could sure use some help. You see, I do explosives, and they have a special need for some big explosions.
GID00014448	Problem is, there's no way I can get enough explosives to do the type of damage they're looking to do, much less get it all deployed.
GID00014449	Blowing shit up, of course. Thing is, they don't need things to blow up, they need people to die in a fairly large area in a fairly small timeframe.
GID00014450	There are other ways to kill people with bombs aside from explosions, if you know what I mean.
GID00014451	Well, since I can't hope to get all the killing done that they need to get done with bombs, I've been thinking about some alternatives.
GID00014452	[SUCCEEDED] Spot on, you're a bright one.
GID00014453	[FAILED] Yeah, I could build a nuke, but I'm not looking to turn the Mojave into a giant mirror.
GID00014454	No, I was thinking something more subtle.
GID00014455	I figure chlorine gas is the way to go. It's toxic, and I can rig it up to do a whole lot of killing in a fairly short timeframe.
GID00014456	Yeah, of course. Ask away.
GID00014457	Okay, come find me whenever you want to chat.
GID00014458	I'm not sure exactly. There is a swimming pool at The Ultra-Luxe, so they probably have some, although I doubt they'd appreciate you taking it.
GID00014459	But they must get it from somewhere, maybe try out in Freeside somewhere.
GID00014460	Hey, you know what I need, find it or I'll find another way to get it. You're the one that offered.
GID00014461	Great. Yeah, this is just what I needed.
GID00014462	Yeah, I heard you might be coming. I appreciate the help, I'm in kind of a fix.
GID00014463	I help the Omertas get guns without the NCR catching wind of it. I need someone to cover my ass with the last shipment.
GID00014464	The Fiends, a group of raiders freaked out on chems, stole my last shipment before I could get it into Vegas.
GID00014465	I could sure use some help getting it from them.
GID00014466	I'm pretty proud of myself. It's a stroke of genius, if I can be so modest.
GID00014467	The whole arrangement starts with an old buddy of mine in the Republic. He's responsible for packing and shipping supplies to the NCR on the Strip.
GID00014468	He marks some containers as food and medical and packs them with guns and other shit.
GID00014469	From there it just took a couple greased palms to get someone to let me cherry pick a container or two out of every shipment. Easy as pie.
GID00014470	I'm pretty proud of myself. It's a stroke of genius, if I can be so modest.
GID00014471	The whole arrangement starts with an old buddy of mine in the Republic. He's responsible for packing and shipping supplies to the NCR on the Strip.
GID00014472	He marks some containers as food and medical and packs them with guns and other shit.
GID00014473	From there it just took a couple greased palms to get someone to let me cherry pick a container or two out of every shipment. Easy as pie.
GID00014474	Sorry, that's my business and no one else's.
GID00014475	What the hell? You got this from the Fiends already? Hot damn, you really are good. Thanks, this is exactly what I needed.
GID00014476	Great, thanks.
GID00014477	Okay, what do you need to know?
GID00014478	Okay, what's on your mind?
GID00014479	Alright, you know where to find me.
GID00014480	Well, hot shit. Thank you. Must have been a real bitch getting it from the Fiends, thanks.
GID00014481	Those fools are from NCR. I love seeing those squatters in agony.
GID00014482	We were doing just fine before those shits came here and made a mess of things. We don't need NCR eggheads wandering around confusing things.
GID00014483	[SUCCEEDED] Um... I think that sounds reasonable... As long as you aren't going to do anything dangerous with it, I guess I can spare some.
GID00014484	[FAILED] I don't know much about biology, but I'm pretty sure that doesn't make a damn bit of sense.
GID00014485	Funny you should mention that, I do have a bit of chlorine here.
GID00014486	Normally I wouldn't sell that to just anyone, but you were so helpful getting us Omerta business again, I'll set some aside for you to buy.
GID00014487	I do, but that's some dangerous stuff. I don't sell it to just anyone, I have to be a responsible businessman.
GID00014488	You're the boss, boss.
GID00014489	Easy as a heart transplant.
GID00014490	Okay.
GID00014491	All right.
GID00014492	I buy that.
GID00014493	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00014494	<bark!>
GID00014495	Makes sense to me.
GID00014496	I hear you.
GID00014497	Got it.
GID00014498	No need to get bossy, dear. Grandma can hear you.
GID00014499	Just like you said five minutes ago. Don't worry, boss, I got it.
GID00014500	Understood. I won't hesitate.
GID00014501	Shoot first, poke bodies later. Got it, boss.
GID00014502	I'm already doing that.
GID00014503	Good. Makes things simple.
GID00014504	You mean like, even more?
GID00014505	Beats waiting till they shoot me first.
GID00014506	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00014507	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00014508	<growl>
GID00014509	<bark!>
GID00014510	I'll do like I'm doing then - except I'll try to smile less.
GID00014511	What, was I not doing it right before?
GID00014512	Got a habit of repeating yourself.
GID00014513	Never get tired of hearing that.
GID00014514	Now we're talking.
GID00014515	With a smile.
GID00014516	You can keep repeating yourself all day, dearie, but I remember what you said.
GID00014517	That's eactly what Leo told me to do!
GID00014518	I'm already doing that.
GID00014519	That's sounding dangerously close to a plan, boss.
GID00014520	I'm hardly a whirlwind of death when left to my own devices, but all right.
GID00014521	I'm already doing that.
GID00014522	I'll follow your lead.
GID00014523	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00014524	I like this plan where you're the decoy.
GID00014525	What a coincidence! I've been doing that all this time!
GID00014526	[Rex is already waiting for you to attack enemies first.]
GID00014527	<bark!>
GID00014528	Thought I was already holding back.
GID00014529	Heard you the first time, no need to repeat yourself.
GID00014530	Guess it's leftovers for me.
GID00014531	Slim pickings, but all right.
GID00014532	Yes, dearie, that's what grandma's been doing. And Leo isn't happy about it, either.
GID00014533	Ohh, Leo's not going to like that....
GID00014534	No! I won't let you have my Raul!
GID00014535	Family, the fucking Omertas. Are you new around here or what?
GID00014536	Zoara is our club. The Family club. If you got business with the bosses, you can go upstairs to talk to them.
GID00014537	What business is that?
GID00014538	Good, get lost.
GID00014539	Yeah, give me what you got.
GID00014540	What the fuck? Oh shit. Yeah, go talk to Nero or Big Sal upstairs. They'll want to see this. I'll send Cachino to the office as well.
GID00014541	It's my fucking job, and no one sees the bosses unless I give the okay.
GID00014542	[SUCCEEDED] Okay, calm down. I'm just doing my job. Go talk to the bosses, one of them should be upstairs. Look for Big Sal or Nero.
GID00014543	I'll tell Cachino to head upstairs.
GID00014544	[FAILED] I don't know who the fuck you think you are, but this is my gate and I'm the gatekeeper.
GID00014545	Do you now? Let's see it.
GID00014546	Like hell you do, show me what you have or get the fuck out of my face.
GID00014547	Here, now give it over.
GID00014548	What the fuck is this shit? Cachino, you dumb motherfucker. Yeah, we are going to have some words with Cachino. Meet me in my office.
GID00014549	[SUCCEEDED] Ok, that sounds fair.
GID00014550	[FAILED] You're real funny. Man, I haven't had a laugh like that in days. Thanks. Now, let's get real here.
GID00014551	[SUCCEEDED] This'll be worth your while. I wouldn't be here talking to you otherwise.
GID00014552	[FAILED] I'm not sure if you're funny or just stupid, but I'm not amused. Make me a real offer and we can talk.
GID00014553	Make it snappy.
GID00014554	Thanks for wasting my time.
GID00014555	He'll be handled in the way the Family handles these situations. I want you there for this, come meet me in my office.
GID00014556	Come to my office and you'll see.
GID00014557	Did he now? Funny that, more backstabbing. Yeah, we got something big planned. I was actually hoping to jaw at you about that.
GID00014558	Now that Cachino is gone, we need some help wrapping some things up, and you seem like the resourceful type.
GID00014559	Okay, what do you need to know?
GID00014560	Why didn't Victor intervene sooner, you mean?
GID00014561	Goodsprings is a bit too far away for me to reliably control a Securitron agent by remote. I can send and receive packets of data, at best.
GID00014562	Victor's combat algorithms determined the proper course of action. Benny and his thugs were more than a match for a lone Securitron.
GID00014563	When he alerted me, I instructed him to approach the site after Benny and the others had departed.
GID00014564	To achieve my aims, I require a capable human agent to perform certain... tasks.
GID00014565	I knew Benny was ambitious, even ruthless. But I believed he would do the job, so long as he was incentivized appropriately.
GID00014566	Obviously, I miscalculated his drive for supremacy. But in any case, you've come along - a more-than-suitable replacement.
GID00014567	I have to think that he found out about the Platinum Chip and mistakenly convinced himself that he could use it to his own ends.
GID00014568	One of the problems of a tribal work force, I'm afraid. No intuitive understanding of how complex technologies can be.
GID00014569	That's simply not true.
GID00014570	I am the only person to hold any rights pertaining to the Chip. I designed it, and I paid for it - dearly.
GID00014571	To develop that Chip, I spent a sum of U.S. dollars - not the bottle caps that pass as currency these days - but a sum beyond counting.
GID00014572	For decades, I paid salvagers to comb the ruins for it. And when it was finally discovered, tens of thousands of caps spent to have it brought here.
GID00014573	We know how that turned out. Complete your contract and it will be the last time I pay for the Chip. Save your questions for then.
GID00014574	You realize you were just one of many couriers, the rest of them dummies, so to speak?
GID00014575	Add to that many thousands of caps worth of mercenary protection to screen your avenue of approach.
GID00014576	Had I used an armed caravan to transport the Chip, I might as well have been announcing to the world "this is important. Attack this!"
GID00014577	I didn't want to attract the attention of groups like the Great Khans or the Brotherhood of Steel. Alas, the real threat was closer to home.
GID00014578	Frontal assaults on casinos? Not good for business.
GID00014579	In any case, Benny would see it coming. And all he'd have to do is hold the Chip up and point a pistol at it.
GID00014580	Our foremost advantage is that Benny doesn't know that I know he has the Chip - let's not squander it.
GID00014581	Then Vegas shall be lost, and with it, mankind's best hope for long-term survival.
GID00014582	To your untrained eyes, it may look as though mankind is making a comeback. In the NCR, you have something that remsembles a nation state.
GID00014583	Savage as it is, in Caesar's Legion, you have an organized society. But neither of these offer a future. They're regurgitations of the past.
GID00014584	Bring me the Platinum Chip, and in ten years you'll hardly recognize this city.
GID00014585	It won't be easy... Benny is always surrounded by at least four bodyguards - except when he's in his private suite on the 13th floor of the Tops...
GID00014586	If you were to approach Benny in public, you might be able to leverage his fear of exposure to make him agree to meet with you in private.
GID00014587	Sneaking into Benny's suite on the 13th floor would be very difficult... but not impossible.
GID00014588	There might be guards. Certainly there'd be a sturdy lock on his front door.
GID00014589	It's more complicated than that. The Chairmen share what you might call a... tribal affinity.
GID00014590	Look for a man named Swank, Benny's second-in-command. He's always been a reliable, if unimaginative, employee.
GID00014591	Do your best to convince him that you're working under my auspices. If you have evidence of Benny's crimes, show it to him.
GID00014592	By contract, Securitrons are to enter the casinos only when invited by the Three Families or if other extraordinary circumstances arise.
GID00014593	The moment I send one into the Tops, Benny will know I'm on to him.
GID00014594	We can discuss this in greater detail at another time. Suffice it to say that when my Securitrons detected NCR scouts at Hoover Dam, I took action.
GID00014595	I recruited a tribal force to supplement my Securitrons and renovated the Strip just in time to welcome the NCR as it marched into the region.
GID00014596	Instead of war, a treaty was negotiated. And the money started to pour in.
GID00014597	Tribals, nothing special. Spend some time in the casinos and you'll catch the gist of each Family.
GID00014598	The only requirement was that the tribals agree to follow my directions. Some, like the Khans and the Kings, did not - and suffered for it.
GID00014599	<growl...>
GID00014600	Santiago knows not of what you speak.
GID00014601	Wait! Here is a full refund! Don't kill me!
GID00014602	Wait! Here is a full refund! Don't kill me!
GID00014603	I'm kidding, ha ha! There is no discount. Sorry!... Please don't kill me.
GID00014604	I can give you this tip, though. I have seen a few people go to the pawn shop then somehow get through the south gate to Vegas without caps.
GID00014605	Coincidence? I think not. Ralph and Mick have something going on there, but they refuse to let me in on it.
GID00014606	I appologize, friend, but that is absurd given the value of this information.
GID00014607	[SUCCEEDED] 25 caps will do. Tell Mick Santiago sent you and the code word is 'extravaganza'. He will set you up.
GID00014608	[FAILED] Sorry, my friend. 50 caps is the price to be a VIP.
GID00014609	Sir, Santiago told you. Santiago has no debts.
GID00014610	No! Don't!
GID00014611	You won't! I'll be clean as a whistle!
GID00014612	[SUCCEEDED] Here, I'll pay you back extra! I'm sorry!
GID00014613	[SUCCEEDED] Here, I'll pay you back extra! I'm sorry!
GID00014614	[FAILED] I don't have any more than that to give! I'm sorry!
GID00014615	If I had two caps to scrape together I'd buy the materials to make my own, but my damn hands won't stop shaking.
GID00014616	This guy named Dixon. Something about him seems sketchy, but I can't stop now. Last time I stopped, I felt like I was going to turn inside out.
GID00014617	At this point, I'm mostly buying his stuff just so I don't feel sick. Speaking of which, do you have any spare caps?
GID00014618	We've got the basics covered, but now that you mention it, we have had unusual requests from some of our wealthier customers.
GID00014619	If you can recruit escorts to match these customers'... proclivities... I'd be willing to pay you finder's fees.
GID00014620	I still need those escorts if you're interested.
GID00014621	Our wealthiest client has a thing for ghouls, and a thing for cowboys. He wants an escort who can satisfy both fetishes.
GID00014622	Plenty of customers have said they'd be willing to pay extra for a suave talker, someone who can fake the "boyfriend experience" real good.
GID00014623	And then there's these disgusting robot fetishists you may have heard about? Well, those creeps want a sexbot.
GID00014624	Have you ever run across a sexbot? Not that I'd ever want one within 100 feet of me - but I gotta be a businessman about it.
GID00014625	Come on back and see me if you change your mind.
GID00014626	Just direct them to the Wrangler. I'll pay you when they show up.
GID00014627	Oh, I'd still be the pimp - you'd just be my pissant recruiter is all. Let me know if you change your mind.
GID00014628	Just don't rough up the merchandise before delivery - you break it, you bought it.
GID00014629	[SUCCEEDED] Okay, you've got yourself a deal. Find escorts to fill the positions and I'll pay double.
GID00014630	[FAILED] Sorry, double is out of the question.
GID00014631	[SUCCEEDED] Okay, you've got yourself a deal. Find escorts to fill the positions and I'll pay double.
GID00014632	[FAILED] Sorry, but that is the best I can do.
GID00014633	No problem.
GID00014634	What did you want to talk about?
GID00014635	You aren't the first poor sucker who's come in here saying that. We don't do discounts here.
GID00014636	Sounds like you were ripped off. I'd go get your money back from Santiago.
GID00014637	Then the King has no interest in seeing you.
GID00014638	[SUCCEEDED] You know what? I like you. Half of the people around here, they forget who runs this place.
GID00014639	Head on through. The King's the bored-looking guy by the stage. Can't fuckin miss him.
GID00014640	[FAILED] No, trust me, the King will want to see you if I want you to see him. Come back when you figure out how the world works.
GID00014641	Really? Oh, I wasn't expecting you to agree so easily. That's great!
GID00014642	Here, take this packet sniffer. It will allow us to intercept data on Mr. House's network.
GID00014643	You might have to manually remove the encryption from his data network, but hopefully you won't have too much trouble. Good luck!
GID00014644	Okay. No rush, but the sooner the Followers can learn about Mr. House's technology, the better.
GID00014645	Good to hear, but it looks like the bug was deactivated a few minutes after it went online.
GID00014646	It looks like House has some kind of countermeasure in place to prevent evesdropping on his network. We'll get through eventually, just not today.
GID00014647	Here are those medical supplies I promised. Hopefully you won't need to use them. Take care.
GID00014648	It looks like we've started getting reports from the tower's network! I'm sure the others will be able to make some sense of this.
GID00014649	Oh what the hell? The bug went offline! Dammit!
GID00014650	I swear to God that old man has thought of everything. Well, it looks like this was all for nothing, but you did your best. I appreciate the help.
GID00014651	We haven't received any information yet from the bug. Please report back when you've found a way into House's network.
GID00014652	But what about those nasty critters?
GID00014653	But, what about the R O U S's?
GID00014654	Very well, but please do be careful.
GID00014655	I will be returning to California to start anew. If anything is left of the caravan, please keep it as a show of thanks for your kindness.
GID00014656	It is so rare to meet good friendly people in the wastes. Here is the last location of the caravan. Good luck.
GID00014657	Oh I assure you, sir, they are very real and very large. Please do be careful.
GID00014658	I will be returning to California to start anew. If anything is left of the caravan, please keep it as a show of thanks for your kindness.
GID00014659	It is so rare to meet good friendly people in the wastes. Here is the last location of the caravan. Good luck.
GID00014660	[SUCCEEDED] I'm short 90 caps or so, but I have a few cartons of cigarettes and some sensor modules I could put toward my debt.
GID00014661	At this point I'll have to return to California to start anew. I haven't got a cap to my name.
GID00014662	[FAILED] I don't even have enough caps to get a new caravan up and running. What makes you think I have enough to afford anything else of value?
GID00014663	[SUCCEEDED] Damn. I didn't want to hand over all of my caps because I won't have enough to get home to California.
GID00014664	Here, take it all. I'll find my way home one way or another.
GID00014665	[SUCCEEDED] Oh you charming wonderful hunk of man. I agree, I cannot risk my reputation on such a paltry sum.
GID00014666	Here is what I owe, paid in full. I may scrape a bit to get home to California, but I'm a resourceful woman.
GID00014667	Here is the last known location of my caravan if you feel like looking for it. Until we meet again, handsome.
GID00014668	Oh, that makes me so happy! You are too much!
GID00014669	Yeah, I've got a few ideas that I'm working on. Maybe I'll let you in on it once I have something.
GID00014670	Yeah, I know. That's why I'm not really going to do it.
GID00014671	You are the first person to step foot inside the Lucky 38 in over 200 years. It was not an invitation I made lightly.
GID00014672	We have a serious matter to discuss, concerning a contract you have yet to fulfill.
GID00014673	You have an "interest" in this, whether you like it or not. You signed a contract to deliver the Platinum Chip to me.
GID00014674	Now, I could stop you from leaving, but what would that accomplish? If you want to go, go.
GID00014675	See what the Strip I built - the Strip I own - has to offer. Think about what I could offer you. I expect we'll have occasion to talk again.
GID00014676	<bark!>
GID00014677	Rex? It breaks my heart every time I see him. He's such a good dog.
GID00014678	No, Rex's condition is way beyond anything we can handle. He requires brain surgery, and some sophisticated cybernetics work, too.
GID00014679	Yes, a few months ago. We had to tell him there was nothing we could do.
GID00014680	I didn't say that. While no one here has that kind of expertise, I do know of one man who might fit the bill.
GID00014681	There's an old scientist named Dr. Henry who reportedly specializes in this sort of procedure. He'd probably be your best bet.
GID00014682	Last I heard, he was living up in Jacobstown, far to the northwest.
GID00014683	Consider me your personal welcome wagon! Now hear this - the head honcho of New Vegas, Mr. House, is itching to make your acquaintance.
GID00014684	Just head for the Lucky 38. It's the big ol' tower shaped like a roulette spinner.
GID00014685	The place to get started is the Lucky 38. See that big ol' tower shaped like a roulette spinner?
GID00014686	That's where you'll find Mr. House, New Vegas's head honcho. And he's itching to make your acquaintance.
GID00014687	Sorry, rambler. I know you're fixing to serve up some vengeance, but I'm gonna have to point you to the Lucky 38 first.
GID00014688	Mr. House, the head honcho of New Vegas, is itching to make your acquaintance. He'll help you serve that cold dish of yours extra-chilly.
GID00014689	Sure you are, rambler. I know you're fixing to serve up some vengeance, but I'm gonna have to point you to the Lucky 38 first.
GID00014690	Mr. House, the head honcho of New Vegas, is itching to make your acquaintance. He'll help you serve that cold dish of yours extra-chilly.
GID00014691	Well now, it was Mr. House who made Securitrons like me. Seems the least I could do is pass on his message. Don't dawdle. He'll be waiting.
GID00014692	Yeehaw, pardner! That's the spirit. He'll be waiting for you.
GID00014693	Don't you dawdle, little doggie! Mr. House isn't someone you want to go about snubbing. He'll be waiting.
GID00014694	Bad idea, pardner! That man you're chasing, he's a bad penny all right - a rattlesnake of a man. Think of Mr. House as anti-venom.
GID00014695	It's some kind of data storage device, dig? So it's the data on the Chip that's platinum, not the Chip itself.
GID00014696	Trouble is, the Chip don't fit any computer I've found. Must require special hardware.
GID00014697	It has something to do with the Securitrons, I know that much. Upgrades their hitting power, gives them heft.
GID00014698	Might be slightly useful, if you're looking to defend the Strip from Caesar's Legion or the NCR. Or maybe both?
GID00014699	You help me, and before long the Chairmen will rule all of Vegas, dig? With enough robot muscle to back it up.
GID00014700	You'll get a sweet, juicy cut of that action. But until that day comes, I'll keep you on retainer, and pay bonuses for "special missions."
GID00014701	How's that sound?
GID00014702	A magician don't explain his tricks. I get it.
GID00014703	Look at me, a big-leaguer or so I claim, making all the mistakes of an original loser...
GID00014704	Looks like I should think about quitting...
GID00014705	To think I deemed that flintbox my lucky charm. Oh, the irony...
GID00014706	You really weren't supposed to talk to him...
GID00014707	All right, so he used to be a Securitron on patrol. Square as the rest, until I gave him a mickey in the shape of pulse grenade.
GID00014708	Once he was on the nod, I yanked some wires and dragged him up to the workshop. I had... some help, you see.
GID00014709	Gal named Emily, one of the Followers over in Freeside, a real whiz when it comes to things technical. She programmed his personality.
GID00014710	Once Yes Man was hooked back in to House's data network, I started learning a lot more about what he was up to, dig? Like where and when to find you.
GID00014711	Guess I shoulda seen that coming.
GID00014712	Baby, ease off the gas. The Chip belongs in the hands of someone who can use it. As in me, not you.
GID00014713	You'll get a piece of the action, and a sweet one. But the Chip sticks with me.
GID00014714	Jackpot, baby! I knew we'd see eye to eye!
GID00014715	Here's a start on your retainer - don't spend it all in one place. And the Prez is yours for as long as you want it.
GID00014716	When you're ready to saddle up, come find me down on the casino floor and we'll plan the next step of this caper.
GID00014717	Ring-a-ding, baby! Ta-ta!
GID00014718	Jackpot, baby! I knew we'd see eye to eye!
GID00014719	Here's a start on your retainer. And as a signing bonus, take the key to the Presidential - best suite in the house!
GID00014720	When you're ready to saddle up, come find me down on the casino floor and we'll plan the next step of this caper.
GID00014721	Now if you'll excuse me, I need a moment to collect myself.
GID00014722	Baby, do you not understand the level of game here?
GID00014723	What I did to you was rotten, but if you think House, the NCR or Caesar won't kill to put Vegas in their pocket, I really did blow out your brains.
GID00014724	Not the point I was aiming for but, well, let's see this through.
GID00014725	It's a game, and games have winners and losers. I prefer the former, how about you?
GID00014726	Was a time I would've agreed with you. But this... it's too big, it affects too many people. I can't get hung up on those details.
GID00014727	A good cat to swing with. Or was - until he stopped mewing.
GID00014728	It was House's big idea to resurrect the Strip. He recruited the Three Families as muscle, showed us how to set up casinos, negotiated with the NCR.
GID00014729	None of this in person, mind you. Did all his talking through those Securitrons of his. But lately? The silence is deafening.
GID00014730	The robots collect House's share of the take every week and life goes on. Ain't exactly what I'd call leadership.
GID00014731	We're the definition of cool, baby. We know how to swing. Folks come to us to learn how to enjoy themselves.
GID00014732	Of the three families, we're the only ones with the heart and savoir-faire to run the Strip on our own.
GID00014733	A nation of meddlers, trying to muscle in on our action. Well, we got muscles too, and smarts besides.
GID00014734	Only reason the NCR hasn't busted up our scene is they're a little afraid of Mr. House, and a lot afraid of Caesar.
GID00014735	If the NCR beats the Legion at Hoover Dam, they'll turn on us and claim the Strip. And we don't have the muscle to beat them - not yet.
GID00014736	Meanwhile, they're all that's keeping Caesar's Legion at bay. Plus NCR soldiers and citizens are out best customers. It's complicated.
GID00014737	Worst of the worst! A tribe of degenerate losers led by a creep. They crucify people for kicks! Slaughter whole towns!
GID00014738	The NCR beat them at the dam three years ago, but that didn't stop them. They've spent the meanwhile gathering strength.
GID00014739	They're gonna try to take the dam again, real soon. And if they do, Vegas as we know it will cease to exist.
GID00014740	I know, you figure me for a creep. It's your prerogative.
GID00014741	If you change your mind, come find me on the casino floor. In the meantime, the Presidential is yours whenever you want it. Adios.
GID00014742	I know, you figure me for a creep. And you done me a solid already, just by not shooting at me.
GID00014743	As a token of appreciation, this here's the key to the Presidential - best suite in the house. Stay as long as you like, free of charge.
GID00014744	If you change your mind, come find me down on the casino floor and we'll work out the next step of this caper. Adios.
GID00014745	You forgive me? After what I done? Baby, are you trying to make me cry?
GID00014746	I don't know what to say. Words don't begin. The least I can do is comp you the Presidential for as long as you want it.
GID00014747	This spirit of forgiveness you're showing me... it's enough to make a player rethink what it means to win. You're 18 karat, baby - all the way.
GID00014748	You forgive me? After what I done? Baby, are you trying to make me cry?
GID00014749	I don't know what to say. Words don't begin. Here, take the key to the Presidential - the best suite in the house. Stay as long as you like.
GID00014750	This spirit of forgiveness you're showing me... it's enough to make a player rethink what it means to win. You're 18 karat, baby. Catch you later.
GID00014751	We gotta problem, boys!
GID00014752	Baby, the odds may look long, but that's just because we ain't done rigging them. I won't toss the dice until we are.
GID00014753	I've gleaned a lot, working with Mr. House. He was a good cat to swing with. I still got more to learn, but it's... it's coming together.
GID00014754	Uh oh.
GID00014755	A tribe of finks. Every single one of them is a degenerate.
GID00014756	Mark my words - they're playing an angle. How do I know? They always are.
GID00014757	Personally? They give me the heebie-jeebies. There's such a thing as being too polite, "if I may" this and "my pleasure" that.
GID00014758	Don't get me wrong - that resort of theirs is strictly ring-a-ding. But my guts say, "don't go in the basement."
GID00014759	Yeah, Cachino is a creep. I'll give you a key for some caps... Hazard pay.
GID00014760	Yeah, Cachino is a creep. I'll give you a key for some caps... Hazard pay.
GID00014761	No skin off my back.
GID00014762	Fine, here you go. If anyone asks you ain't never seen me before.
GID00014763	Fine, here you go. If anyone asks you ain't never seen me before.
GID00014764	[SUCCEEDED] Sounds like a deal to me.
GID00014765	[FAILED] Yeah, but come back when you have the money.
GID00014766	[FAILED] I bet it does, but free ain't gonna work.
GID00014767	[SUCCEEDED] Really? That was his idea? Alright, he can go. Hopefully he finds us some good deals out there.
GID00014768	[FAILED] You're really funny. I like you. But no. We still have business for Troike.
GID00014769	[SUCCEEDED] Yeah, I see where you're coming from. Okay, tell Troike he can hit the road.
GID00014770	[FAILED] Nah, I don't think so. We've still got some work for him to do.
GID00014771	I bet he does. That's from hookers and chems. His work for us is the most restful part of his day.
GID00014772	[SUCCEEDED] Alright, you've done some good work for us. I'll do this as a favor for you.
GID00014773	[FAILED] Yeah, I'm sure they enjoy the cash flow, but that doesn't mean dick to me.
GID00014774	[SUCCEEDED] We don't want to draw attention to ourselves. Alright, we'll give them a little bit of extra business.
GID00014775	[FAILED] They're small timers, I could give a fuck what they would enjoy.
GID00014776	Sorry, but I don't know you from Adam, and you don't have any business getting in our business.
GID00014777	Well you've been a real thorn in our side. We've got business plans. You set us back a little bit, I'll admit that.
GID00014778	However, we wanted you to know that nothing you did made a shit bit of difference, and you're going to die a failure.
GID00014779	Yeah, we lost some guns you little weasel. However, we can get more guns. You slowed us down but you can't stop us.
GID00014780	You're gonna die a failure.
GID00014781	Alright, let's dance.
GID00014782	Cachino? What the fu...
GID00014783	You better get outside for a little bit. I'm sure they are going to look for the infamous courier when things go to hell.
GID00014784	Yeah, poor fucker got himself caught after he melted all the guns. Bastard mentioned your name before they shot him in the head.
GID00014785	Now the bosses want to see you.
GID00014786	Whoa, you managed to pull that off? Solid work. That ought to gum up the bosses' plans.
GID00014787	Well, what the fuck are you talking to me for? Go destroy the damn guns so we can move on.
GID00014788	Yeah, we saw the troopers come through. I can't imagine things are going to work out well for him.
GID00014789	Oh, is that right? Well I guess if he's gone, he's gone. I don't need to know anything more than that.
GID00014790	Oh, is that right? Was that your handiwork? Well I can't say I'm sad to see him go, he gave me the fucking creeps.
GID00014791	Alright, let's have them.
GID00014792	Now we cut off the head of the serpent. Big Sal and Nero have to die.
GID00014793	As long as they're alive, they can start up their plans again. All you've managed to do is stall them. I guarantee you they have contingencies.
GID00014794	They're a little bit upset about what's been done to muck up their plans. They tasked me to find out who's responsible.
GID00014795	There isn't going to be another chance to get both of them together in the same room. I'll slip you a gun and we can take them out.
GID00014796	When they're gone I'm gonna run this joint. Don't worry, I'll take care of the place.
GID00014797	[SUCCEEDED] Alright, I'll take care of them. Just give me the word when to start shooting.
GID00014798	[FAILED] If you aren't a good shot then we're fucked anyways. No, I think you're going to have to do it.
GID00014799	Hurry and get ready. I'll give you a gun when you get to the room.
GID00014800	Hurry and get ready. I'll be waiting for you there when you're ready.
GID00014801	Hurry and get ready. I'll give you a gun when you get to the room.
GID00014802	Hurry and get ready. I'll be waiting for you there when you're ready.
GID00014803	Holy shit, really? Okay, I'll help you, but I'm getting the hell out of here first chance I get.
GID00014804	All right.
GID00014805	It's one of the biggest sources of electrical power in the region, so the NCR's fortified the place pretty heavily.
GID00014806	When President Kimball shows up on his inspection tour, I'm sure he'll be confident that the Dam is safe and secure.
GID00014807	They're an outlaw group, primarily trafficking in drugs and other contraband. They usually stay out of NCR territory, though.
GID00014808	Camp McCarran is the headquarters for the NCR military in this region. It occupies the old airport next to New Vegas.
GID00014809	It's probably just a political thing - you know, give a few speeches, shake hands with the troops, boost morale.
GID00014810	Destroyed during the Battle of Hoover Dam a couple of years ago. The town was set up as a trap for Caesar's Legion.
GID00014811	The sharpshooters in the Rangers picked off the Legion's veterans from a distance, and the rest of the Legion just rushed on in. Then - boom!
GID00014812	[SUCCEEDED] Oh, Julie... I've really screwed things up.
GID00014813	I'll head over to the fort and get some rest. This has gone on too long.
GID00014814	[FAILED] Sissy?! Real men can hold their liquor, and I'm double-clutching mine!
GID00014815	[SUCCEEDED] Never thought about using that combination before. Should be able to get through this with that.
GID00014816	[FAILED] No way, the withdrawal symptoms will kill me if I don't have Fixer to flush out the chems.
GID00014817	[SUCCEEDED] Man, you're one hell of an egghead. If you think it'll work, I'll give it a shot.
GID00014818	[FAILED] Oh, I'll be vomiting plenty if you don't get me Fixer. You're worse than that damn dealer.
GID00014819	What do you want to talk about?
GID00014820	Sure, let's see what you've got.
GID00014821	[SUCCEEDED] Er, noticed that, did you? I keenly aimed one of the shots through some soft tissue of one of them to hit the man behind him.
GID00014822	[FAILED] You're imagining things. It's just the rush of adrenaline caused by your near brush with death.
GID00014823	Luckily for you, I was here, so there's no reason to get out of sorts.
GID00014824	Call it a hunch. You do this job for long enough, and you learn to trust your instincts.
GID00014825	My thoughts exactly. Time is money, after all.
GID00014826	That's an interesting theory you've got there. I'd suggest you keep it to yourself. Let's get moving.
GID00014827	Stay close. I wouldn't want something to happen to you.
GID00014828	[SUCCEEDED] I ought to take my chances and kill you right here, but you may be right. Here, take this.
GID00014829	Don't think this is over, though. I'll have that money back, out of your hide if I have to.
GID00014830	[FAILED] I think I'll keep my money thanks. You take that fanciful tale of yours wherever you'd like. Now let's go. I have a job to finish.
GID00014831	So it went down like that, huh? I guess it can't be helped now.
GID00014832	Even though you lack subtlety, you've shown me you can get the job done, so maybe you can help me with something more important.
GID00014833	Convinced him, huh? I could use more men with your powers of persuasion.
GID00014834	You've shown me you can get the job done, so maybe you can help me with something more important.
GID00014835	Oh! Well, I heard... I mean, we heard... we meaning the Followers of the Apocalypse... that you had been in there. The Lucky 38, I mean.
GID00014836	And we were wondering if you could help us. If it's not too much trouble, of course.
GID00014837	Oh. Great! The Followers of the Apocalypse, well some of us, anyway, have been interested in Mr. House's technology, how he stays alive.
GID00014838	Of course, no one is allowed inside the Lucky 38, so no one knows what's going on. Well, except for you.
GID00014839	Right. We just want to find out what sort of technology Mr. House has used to stay alive for all these years.
GID00014840	It could be of great benefit to the people we try to help, many of whom suffer from hard to diagnose illnesses.
GID00014841	[SUCCEEDED] Hey, who says I can't fix that? You bring me those boom-suits too, okay?
GID00014842	[FAILED] Do I look like a seamstress to you? Those boomsters can stay in their nowhereville until the sun runs out of gas, for all I care. No deal.
GID00014843	[SUCCEEDED] Hey, who says I can't fix that? You bring me those boom-suits too, okay?
GID00014844	[FAILED] Do I look like a seamstress to you? Those boomsters can stay in their nowhereville until the sun runs out of gas, for all I care. No deal.
GID00014845	[SUCCEEDED] Hey, who says I can't fix that? You bring me those boom-suits too, okay?
GID00014846	[FAILED] Do I look like a seamstress to you? Those boomsters can stay in their nowhereville until the sun runs out of gas, for all I care. No deal.
GID00014847	So you're saying Orris isn't available?
GID00014848	That's right. But I'm available. And I'm cheaper.
GID00014849	But I always hire Orris! How do I know you're not trying to steal my business from him?
GID00014850	Look, the Kings clubbed him from behind and dragged him away. I don't think missing your commission is his number one concern right now.
GID00014851	Fine, then. I guess I'll hire you.
GID00014852	Much obliged.
GID00014853	Get lost.
GID00014854	Ah, my little friend has come at last. Not me, darling, though you were doing just fine.
GID00014855	Ladies, take five. I need to talk to my friend here.
GID00014856	<bark!>
GID00014857	You have entered a restricted area! Exit the gate area or you will be fired upon!
GID00014858	You have been warned! Extermination imminent!
GID00014859	Vaporization subroutine initiated!
GID00014860	Unauthorized entry detected!
GID00014861	Have a nice day!
GID00014862	Exterminate!
GID00014863	All right, well, might want to get a move on, is all I'm saying.
GID00014864	He's what? Ah jeez... jeez, this is really bad. What are you going to do?
GID00014865	Yeah? That's ballsy. Good luck with that.
GID00014866	Sure, whatcha need?
GID00014867	Sure, kid, see ya.
GID00014868	He's trying to escape!
GID00014869	You're not getting away!
GID00014870	You aren't allowed up there!
GID00014871	I strongly suggest you take your leave.
GID00014872	Members only.
GID00014873	This is your last warning.
GID00014874	You're trying to help him escape!
GID00014875	Well be a dear and lend a hand upstairs in the banquet hall, if you can. They're in need of more able bodies.
GID00014876	You need to turn around and leave right now, or I shall be forced to draw my cane.
GID00014877	[FAILED] With our dinner in tow? I think not.
GID00014878	[SUCCEEDED] Curse it all. Your timing couldn't be more atrocious. Just make it quick, all right?
GID00014879	[SUCCEEDED] First he's too trusting, now he doesn't trust any of us. It addles the senses.
GID00014880	I suppose caution is the desirable course at this point. It's all of our necks if something goes afoul.
GID00014881	[FAILED] That has to be the most pathetic excuse I've ever heard. You're not taking our main course.
GID00014882	[FAILED] I don't know who you are, but you need to return to the Gourmand this instant!
GID00014883	[FAILED] With our dinner in tow? I think not.
GID00014884	[FAILED] If you're a building inspector, I am the secret identity of Mr. House. Kindly remove yourself.
GID00014885	Not for long.
GID00014886	Those are all members of the White Glove Society. Our founder, Marjorie, gave us all a dress code. There's only one rule to it.
GID00014887	In her words, we must dress in such a way that no one can be said to have dressed better than us.
GID00014888	As for the masks, I'm not allowed to tell you. We're sworn to secrecy.
GID00014889	Actually that's not true. That's just what we're supposed to say.
GID00014890	I think Marjorie likes them for the mystery they create. And the way they make it clear that we're different from everyone else.
GID00014891	But you didn't hear that from me.
GID00014892	Hmm. Must've forgotten to put it on. How embarrassing.
GID00014893	Go ahead.
GID00014894	My, such a popular question. I suppose it is only natural to see us and wonder what it is that makes us special.
GID00014895	The White Glove Society has only just made itself known to the public, of course, but our pedigree was established over generations.
GID00014896	Were we always so refined? I'd be lying if I said yes. But I've always felt we were destined for a place atop modern society. And now, here we are.
GID00014897	Not everyone can wear the finest clothes and eat the finest foods, obviously. That's just the reality we live in.
GID00014898	But surely we can agree that the most tasteful, sophisticated people are the most deserving. That's what the White Glove Society is all about.
GID00014899	If you head back to the hotel rooms, his will be one floor directly above you after you exit the lobby.
GID00014900	So I assume you know why we called you here?
GID00014901	Is this you asking for a last request?
GID00014902	Cachino, you've really disappointed me.
GID00014903	Cachino, we've been friends for a long time. A real long time, but this time you really fucked up.
GID00014904	I'm sorry boss... Sometimes I just can't control myself. I dunno what's wrong with me. I swear, I can turn this around. Just gimme another chance.
GID00014905	I know boss, and I know it is going to be hard for you to trust me again. But are you going to take the word of this outsider over mine?
GID00014906	You've been with the Family long enough to know how this goes. I'm sorry you had to fuck this up. Goodbye, you were a real benefit to the business.
GID00014907	I don't wanna fucking hear it. You've lost the trust of the family. Goodbye, I hope Hell isn't too hot for you.
GID00014908	I'm sorry boss... Sometimes I just can't control myself. I dunno what's wrong with me. I swear, I can turn this around. Just gimme another chance.
GID00014909	I know boss, and I know it is going to be hard for you to trust me again. But are you going to take the word of this outsider over mine?
GID00014910	You've been with the Family long enough to know how this goes. I'm sorry you had to fuck this up. Goodbye, you were a real benefit to the business.
GID00014911	I don't wanna fucking hear it. You've lost the trust of the family. Goodbye, I hope Hell isn't too hot for you.
GID00014912	Hey, here is that gun I promised you. I suggest using it while they are talking, I'm pretty sure they're going to kill you after they've talked.
GID00014913	Hey, I'll take care of them when you're ready, just say the word. I suggest doing it while they're talking to get the drop on them.
GID00014914	Let's have some words. Take a seat on the couch so we can get to talking.
GID00014915	Please, have a seat. Let's have a bit of a pow-wow.
GID00014916	Here.
GID00014917	To the northeast is a settlement, the locals here call them "Boomers." They are sitting on a munitions stockpile that would be invaluable to us.
GID00014918	I'd like you to get in contact with them, and then do whatever it takes to convince them to help us.
GID00014919	Unfortunately, the Boomers keep to themselves and are, let's say, hostile to all outsiders. That is why I need someone like you.
GID00014920	Someone with your background and reputation would have a better chance of reaching them than anyone I have available.
GID00014921	In exchange for your help, you would receive complete amnesty for any past crimes against the NCR, as well as additional benefits and perks.
GID00014922	Do you think you would be able to do this for me?
GID00014923	I'm sorry that you think so. However, if you do happen to change your mind, you can find me here at the embassy.
GID00014924	Any injury, illness, or death gets radioed to Ranger HQ at Camp Golf.
GID00014925	Chief Hanlon and his aides compile the reports and assign reinforcements as needed, and they're not needed here.
GID00014926	Do a fucking headcount, then. Everybody's right where they're supposed to be.
GID00014927	We're here to make sure the Legion doesn't try to sneak around Lake Mead and come at NCR from another direction.
GID00014928	Yep.
GID00014929	What? Chief Hanlon. The man's a war hero? Why would he...? That just doesn't make sense. This is awful...
GID00014930	I knew it. I'm glad you and the Chief were able to put a stop to this.
GID00014931	<bark!><bark!>
GID00014932	All right! Please, follow me. We'll head into the vault right away.
GID00014933	This bunker protects the entrance to the vault - solid stone outside and thick steel on the inside!
GID00014934	Above us there's the control center for this level of the vault's life-support systems, electric grid, radioactive shields and all that jazz.
GID00014935	Don't get lost! My vault has many corridors and rooms - although it is no longer symmetrical, after Mr. House threw us out.
GID00014936	This is the main game-hall. Here we settled the big disputes among the vault's levels.
GID00014937	Chosen representatives gambled against each other here. The winner earned the right to settle the dispute as wished by the collective.
GID00014938	We used to have such parties in this diner! A bitch to clean later... but well worth it!
GID00014939	This hall leads to our guest rooms. You can use the first room on our left. But no snooping next door! That's my room, always was.
GID00014940	Down there is the game room! Each side of the vault had one... but the other is filled with concrete now. Okay, that wraps it up. I'll see you soon!
GID00014941	Well that motherfucker. What the hell. Damn, thanks for finding this.
GID00014942	This should be plenty of proof to cover my ass if they try to rat me out to any authorities.
GID00014943	Okay, try and be fast about it.
GID00014944	I'm pretty proud of myself. It's a stroke of genius, if I can be so modest.
GID00014945	The whole arrangement starts with an old buddy of mine in the Republic. He's responsible for packing and shipping supplies to the NCR on the Strip.
GID00014946	He marks some containers as food and medical and packs them with guns and other shit.
GID00014947	From there it just took a couple greased palms to get someone to let me cherry pick a container or two out of every shipment. Easy as pie.
GID00014948	Okay, here's the Thermite and a key to the room where the guns are stored. Place the Thermite on the crates in the room.
GID00014949	I rigged the light switch outside the room to kick off a spark big enough to hold the Thermite. That should turn that shit into molten slag.
GID00014950	As soon as we're done talking I'm going to make myself like a ghost. I don't want to be anywhere near here when the bosses find out.
GID00014951	Alright, let's.
GID00014952	Okay, cool.
GID00014953	I've made lots of contacts over the years. I have some friends back in California that can get their hands on just about anything.
GID00014954	Mostly I've been calling in every last favor I have.
GID00014955	[SUCCEEDED] Hey, fuck you.
GID00014956	Alright, I'll place the fucking Thermite myself. You get out of the casino for a bit. I'll take care of it while you're gone.
GID00014957	[FAILED] Nothing you could threaten me with holds a candle to what the Omertas would do to me if they caught me.
GID00014958	Thermite is a mix of rust and aluminum dust. If you add a little heat, a massive amount of heat is spit out.
GID00014959	It gives off enough heat to melt through just about anything. It should make short work of the weapons.
GID00014960	As a little pet project I've been making some thermite. Thermite burns as hot as the devil's asshole and can melt through just about anything.
GID00014961	I've been keeping it so if the Family betrays me I can hopefully do some damage before I end up dead or in jail.
GID00014962	Okay, I know the stuff inside and out. What do you want to know?
GID00014963	Do what you got to do, baby, and let the chips fall as they may. You know where to find me.
GID00014964	Oh, now it's on.
GID00014965	It commemorates the Battle of Hoover Dam. The rangers lured the best of Caesar's Legion into Boulder City, then blew the whole town up.
GID00014966	The NCR still lost a bunch of troops in the fighting, though. My older brother sacrificed himself so they could evacuate some of the wounded.
GID00014967	Bye.
GID00014968	Don't worry about it.
GID00014969	[SUCCEEDED] All right, apology accepted. Don't let it happen again.
GID00014970	[FAILED] Yeah, sure, whatever. I'm done with you.
GID00014971	Camp McCarran, but I'm on leave at the moment - heading back to California to see my folks.
GID00014972	I'm supposed to join up with a caravan that's heading that way up at the 188, but they're not due to arrive for awhile yet.
GID00014973	Just get the fuck away from here, already.
GID00014974	Oh, that's it. Your ass is mine!
GID00014975	Of course.
GID00014976	Please let me know if anything catches your eye.
GID00014977	Hey, you want the best, you have to pay for it.
GID00014978	In that case, some of the things I need handled will be right up your alley.
GID00014979	I beg your pardon, then. I'll let you get about your business.
GID00014980	Oh, yeah, sure!
GID00014981	Okay - I got these great lunchboxes, they are super! What else? Oh! Look at these toasters! You like toasts, right? If they are crunchy even better!
GID00014982	What about a vintage Vault-Tec toy car? Or-
GID00014983	Okay, I do, but who wants a lame sensor module, or a nitrogen canister, anyway?
GID00014984	All the popular stuff has been sold - especially the vault suits. I need to find more because people buy them like hot cakes.
GID00014985	Leather suits are good times! Thinking about that just blows my top!
GID00014986	You would? You really would?
GID00014987	That would help me, a lot!
GID00014988	You would? You really would?
GID00014989	That would help me, a lot!
GID00014990	I'll pay you good money per each suit.
GID00014991	[SUCCEEDED] Really? Well... Ha! I don't even know what to say to that!
GID00014992	Cool it, smarty-pants! I don't have to take that shit from anybody, you know? Get out! Don't come back until you learn how to get along.
GID00014993	Okay. Anything else I can do for you?
GID00014994	[FAILED] Oh yeah? I bet you spend most of the time thinking lines rather than putting them to use. That vault merchandise is not on your menu! Next!
GID00014995	Thank you so much!
GID00014996	You are an angel. I can't wait to see you again!
GID00014997	Thank you so much!
GID00014998	[FAILED] Oh, don't floor it... There's a lot more to this than a classy chassis, you know?
GID00014999	Anyway, what do you say about my proposal?
GID00015000	If you could bring me vault suits, I would so make it worth your while... I mean, really! But it has to be good leather, okay!?
GID00015001	Okay, I do, but who wants a lame sensor module, or a nitrogen canister, anyway?
GID00015002	All the popular stuff has been sold - especially the vault suits. I need to find more because people buy them like hot cakes.
GID00015003	Leather suits are good times! Thinking about that just blows my top!
GID00015004	My vault is pure New Vegas. Everyone has a chance and lady luck smiles if you play your odds right!... Okay, it was like that before we had to leave.
GID00015005	Vault 21 had very smart ways to help people get along. All arguments and fights got solved through gambling.
GID00015006	I'll give you a quick tour of my home! Oh, yeah, if you like.
GID00015007	Vault 21 had very smart ways to help people get along. All arguments and fights got solved through gambling.
GID00015008	I'll give you a quick tour of my home! Oh, yeah, if you like.
GID00015009	Vault 21 had very smart ways to help people get along. All arguments and fights got solved through gambling.
GID00015010	Sure I have! I made the scene in The Strip. It is just that I really like it here - Vault 21 is a kick!
GID00015011	[SUCCEEDED] Okay - you're right. I hate going outside. It's almost impossible for me to step out of here. Still, I love my vault. It's my pad!
GID00015012	Okay - you're right. I hate going outside. It's almost impossible for me to step out of here. Still, I love my vault. It's my pad!
GID00015013	[FAILED] I grew up in it. I love it - my favorite place in the world!
GID00015014	I don't know! Maybe he didn't want anybody sneaking around down there.
GID00015015	My vault runs deep and wide! It's filled with corridors and rooms that go far.
GID00015016	What gives him the right to screw us with the royal shaft, anyway? So, he saved New Vegas. Wohooo! Now scram and let us go on with our lives! Sheesh!
GID00015017	Mr. House has everything to do with Vault 21. He tried to get us out before he filled it with concrete.
GID00015018	I almost went ape! So, we convinced him - okay, Sheldon and I, right? We convinced him to leave the top level mostly intact!
GID00015019	Mr. House has everything to do with Vault 21. He tried to get us out before he filled it with concrete.
GID00015020	Yeah - and you got to dig what I did with it! Looking as good as it should... almost.
GID00015021	Righty-o, daddy-o. Let's do it!
GID00015022	Sure! The place's packed... usually.
GID00015023	We get loads of NCR cubes these days, a stray Brahmin baron once in a while, and recently circled couples shining big rocks on their fingers.
GID00015024	It was bustling with activity! We all knew each other so well - you see, the vault kept us all even. It's all symmetry and windows down there.
GID00015025	We solved any quarrels through gambling! Lady luck casts no eyeballs, you know? So, nobody shafted anyone else!
GID00015026	Yeah... I miss those days!
GID00015027	Yeah... I miss those days!
GID00015028	[SUCCEEDED] Ha ha ha! Okay - why don't you help me out and in the meantime I will think about where to... take advantage of your skills.
GID00015029	Oh, that makes me so happy! You are too much!
GID00015030	All right! What would you like to know?
GID00015031	I see. Okay, your move.
GID00015032	I take care of it but I suppose you could say that it belongs to Mr. House.
GID00015033	Howdy, pardner! You've come a far piece, haven't you? Welcome to New Vegas!
GID00015034	More than you ever dreamed, baby.
GID00015035	The time for talk has passed, honey baby. These mouths of ours have appointments to be elsewhere.
GID00015036	You tramp! Like I needed another social disease anyhow!
GID00015037	To start, I'll comp you the Presidential - best suite in the house. You deserve a taste of the VIP lifestyle.
GID00015038	I'll hang out down here for a while to make everything look business-as-usual, then come to you. Any questions you got, I'll answer - guaranteed.
GID00015039	Why would I do that, baby? I want to talk to you as much as you want to talk to me.
GID00015040	And you dig this is just first base, right? You and me have a future together, and it's big league and open all night.
GID00015041	Here's this key to the Prez. I'll see you there in two shakes. Ta-ta.
GID00015042	[SUCCEEDED] Where's my manners? Here's some cash up front. There'll be more where that came from.
GID00015043	Wait for me in the Presidential suite. We got a future together, you and me. It's time we got started.
GID00015044	[FAILED] This operation has cost me plenty. I ain't about to get shaken down by some Johnny-come-lately.
GID00015045	[FAILED] This operation has cost me plenty. I ain't about to get shaken down by some Janey-come-lately.
GID00015046	There's a first-class offer on the table. The rest is up to you.
GID00015047	Starts combat.
GID00015048	[SUCCEEDED] If that's what it takes to win your trust, that's what it takes. Follow me.
GID00015049	[FAILED] You tracked me across the desert, Sugar Plum. Finding the Presidential? Easy pickings.
GID00015050	Then this is endsville, baby - may the best man win.
GID00015051	Baby, you're the boss. All you gotta do is whistle.
GID00015052	In the meantime, enjoy the high life. Room service is on me. I'll send up a bottle of the good stuff. Ta-ta.
GID00015053	Baby, you're the boss. All you gotta do is whistle.
GID00015054	Here, take some chips and see how you do at the tables. Ta-ta.
GID00015055	See ya around.
GID00015056	In the meantime, enjoy the high life. Room service is on me. I'll send up a bottle of the good stuff. Ta-ta.
GID00015057	They seem to have it in for me. Go figure. While they waste all their bullets trying to get me, you head in and waste 'em.
GID00015058	Take these assholes out, what else? Now go!
GID00015059	[SUCCEEDED] You're a bastard after my own heart. Here, it's all I got.
GID00015060	Now get in there and waste those guys!
GID00015061	[FAILED] What the hell? I ain't got that kind of money!
GID00015062	Take those guys out and I'm sure the King will reward you just fine.
GID00015063	Please return when you have sufficient caps or a passport.
GID00015064	Ambassador Crocker can be found in his office through the door to my right at the end of the hall.
GID00015065	The Embassy offices are to your left while the barracks and living quarters are to the right.
GID00015066	If you're looking for a history lesson, I suggest you talk to Ambassador Crocker.
GID00015067	I don't have time to give my life story to everyone that passes through. Is there something I can actually help you with?
GID00015068	Us troopers mostly come to the Strip for our R&R. We blow off some steam by gambling, drinking, partying, or fighting.
GID00015069	If you're looking for a good time, I'd suggest hitting up Gomorrah. The girls there are pretty nice, if you know what I mean.
GID00015070	What have you heard? I know people think I'm a little on the wild side, but I'm just trying to have fun, you know?
GID00015071	Just because I happen to get into fights and like to pull pranks doesn't mean anything.
GID00015072	He's a little stiff and stuffy. Doesn't leave the office that much, always surrounds himself with papers and reports.
GID00015073	I've always wanted to play a prank on him, but there's no way I could ever pull that off without getting in trouble from Captain Pappas.
GID00015074	Sorry. I don't know much about him. We run in different circles, you know?
GID00015075	She may be a bit of a hardass, but she's the best damn Captain we've had here. I'd be careful around her. You don't want to get on her bad side.
GID00015076	If you're digging for dirt on the Captain, you're digging in the wrong place.
GID00015077	More of the usual. We're keeping an eye on the troopers to make sure they don't do anything stupid.
GID00015078	The only stupid one we've had lately is Private Erwin. He's starting to cause me more trouble than he's worth.
GID00015079	None of your business. You better keep your nose clean because I'll be watching you.
GID00015080	People drink, gamble, and fight. What do you think happens on the Strip? Any other intelligent questions?
GID00015081	How the hell did a brahmin get loose on the Strip? If this is another one of Private Erwin's pranks, I'll make him regret it.
GID00015082	I've got to deal with drunk troopers making fools of themselves and embarassing all of the NCR with their behavior, so it's just another day here.
GID00015083	Some idiot decided it would be funny to put up graffiti all over the Strip. If I find out it was one of my men, they'll be locked up for a month.
GID00015084	Some fool troopers think they can lounge around on the rooftops instead of doing their job. If I catch them, they'll have KP duty for a year.
GID00015085	Some drunk girls thought it would be fun to play in the fountain in front of the Ultra-Luxe. Now I need to clean up the mess.
GID00015086	Not much to tell. Keeping the troopers in line and monitoring the Strip keeps me busy. It's my job and I'm going to do it well.
GID00015087	Now if that's all, I've got work to do.
GID00015088	Look, I don't know you at all and I'm not really interested in small talk. If you have something important to say, do so quickly.
GID00015089	Crocker isn't too bad. He mostly stays in his office now. If you have any questions about the Embassy you should ask him. He'll talk your ear off.
GID00015090	If you want to know more about the Ambassador, go talk to him yourself.
GID00015091	Private Erwin... he's starting to get a thick file here with all his troublemaking.
GID00015092	My troopers are my business. Stay out of it.
GID00015093	I hit what I was aiming for. Guess you had brains to spare. Or are you just thick-skulled?
GID00015094	Either way, baby, this is good news. Maybe I can finally sleep at night, knowing you didn't die.
GID00015095	Cash me outta this mess!
GID00015096	I can't do that, baby, and you know it. There's a lot of angles to this caper - complexities aplenty.
GID00015097	But plenty of action, too - enough for both of us. But we don't jabber about that out here in public.
GID00015098	You making a pass at me, sister? Because I'm out of your league.
GID00015099	Did those bullets scramble your egg? Or have you always been a naughty broad...?
GID00015100	You're one sick pussycat, baby. There's quins and then there's... I don't even know what to call you.
GID00015101	I hear "dig" from you, babe, and all I can think of is a shovel. How can this be? This ain't forgiveness, it's something... wrong.
GID00015102	All right, honey baby, this is all kinds of wrong, but to my suite it is. Thirteenth floor. Don't keep me waiting.
GID00015103	Wow-ee wow wow, girl. This is all kinds of wrong, but I'm in for a dozen.
GID00015104	You want a reason, how about four?
GID00015105	They're called bodyguards, and every one of them is packing. Me, too - so baby makes five.
GID00015106	Add to that every Chairman in this joint is armed, and not with some hold-out peashooter like maybe you smuggled through security.
GID00015107	Anyhow, baby, you didn't come here for vengeance. You came to get clued in.
GID00015108	You've got a crazy drop on me here, baby, that's for sure. If killing's what you came for, this would be the time.
GID00015109	But baby - you'd be disappointing me. All the trouble you went through to arrange this shin-dig? Must be something more you're after...?
GID00015110	Cachino? Get out of my face.
GID00015111	I bet you say that to all the girls. Yeah, head over to Brimstone, he'll find you there.
GID00015112	Gorgeous, you can have anything you want from me. Cachino is in Brimstone.
GID00015113	Well thank you, gorgeous. Yeah, look for Cachino in Brimstone.
GID00015114	Well thank you, gorgeous. Yeah, look for Cachino in Brimstone.
GID00015115	Whoa, simmer down! Head over to Brimstone. I'll have him find you there.
GID00015116	Ah, Troike? What's he want? Some more Jet, a fresh batch of girls? Maybe a guy or two this time?
GID00015117	My associate Big Sal deals with Troike and his business. When my shift down here is done you can talk to him.
GID00015118	We run a hotel. What do you think our business is?
GID00015119	Why would I want to do that?
GID00015120	What? That he's a murdering Jet-head? Not a new story around here.
GID00015121	Okay, what's on your mind?
GID00015122	Damn right you're sorry.
GID00015123	I don't see how that's your business. I'm just a guest here, having a little fun.
GID00015124	Hey man, I don't know nothing. Let me have some peace here, buddy.
GID00015125	Hey man, I don't know nothing. Let me have some peace here, lady.
GID00015126	I keep a little switchblade tucked away with me. You never know when you might find some trouble.
GID00015127	Cachino... Cachino what? Are you kidding me? He must be trying to get me killed.
GID00015128	They're keeping them in a little utility section down off the basement.
GID00015129	I don't know what they're arming themselves for, but I know it isn't for the good of mankind.
GID00015130	Oh man, I don't even like to think about it. All that goddamn blood. It was just in the hotel like any other night.
GID00015131	I took some chems with the girl I was with, but I never black out. I did this time though.
GID00015132	Next thing I knew I woke up and she was lying next to me stabbed dead. There was a knife next to the bed and I was covered in her blood.
GID00015133	That night? Mostly buffout, I like to cut it with a little bit of jet, and wash it down with some whiskey. That was my standard Saturday night...
GID00015134	When I saw the body I started screaming, a few seconds some of their soldiers were in there cleaning up the room.
GID00015135	They offered to keep silent about what happened if I agreed to help them get their hands on large quantities of guns, at deep discounts.
GID00015136	Like I said, pretty standard for me. I can handle my shit.
GID00015137	[SUCCEEDED] What? Yeah, you're right. I wonder what was up with that.
GID00015138	[FAILED] I've done much more than that in a single night and lived to tell the tale.
GID00015139	Alright, have at it.
GID00015140	What do you wanna talk about?
GID00015141	See ya.
GID00015142	You'd do that? For me? I'm not sure what can be done, but you'd be doing me a solid if you would. I've been talking to Big Sal mostly.
GID00015143	Yeah? Well fuck that. The bosses have my number, and I'm a company man while they've got the goods on me.
GID00015144	More power to you if you can, but keep me out of it. I've been doing business with Big Sal, so he's going to be your man.
GID00015145	[SUCCEEDED] Great. So I'm fucked either way. I guess I don't have any choice but to help you. Just try not to get me killed here.
GID00015146	[FAILED] Nothing you could do scares me as much as the Omertas.
GID00015147	[SUCCEEDED] I guess if Cachino trusts you I can tell you a little of what happened. It all started with a prostitute in here.
GID00015148	[FAILED] No way, man. I don't want to think about it, much less talk about it.
GID00015149	Withdrawal could kill me if I don't get them soon.
GID00015150	Fine. If you really care so much, then get me some shots of Fixer to calm down these shakes.
GID00015151	I'm gonna need at least ten shots to get me through the week. From there the Followers should be able to help.
GID00015152	See you.
GID00015153	Julie is a saint, but I don't need help. I feel young and strong, as long as I get my chems.
GID00015154	Why stop? I feel great!
GID00015155	No worries. My guy will be here soon enough, just wait.
GID00015156	What?! I need a fix now!
GID00015157	I saw them. Thank you so much for helping them. This means a lot to the Followers of the Apocalypse. You have our thanks.
GID00015158	If you need some medical supplies, come see me. With Jacob working with us, we should be able to spare a stim or fixer once a day.
GID00015159	I saw Bill, but found Jacob Dead. His death will be a big loss for Freeside.
GID00015160	Thank you for helping Bill. At least he will help repair things around here.
GID00015161	I saw Jacob, but found Bill dead... His death will be a big loss for Freeside.
GID00015162	If you need some medical supplies, come see me. With Jacob working with us, we should be able to spare a stim or fixer once a day.
GID00015163	No you didn't! They're both dead!
GID00015164	I don't know what you're pulling here, but this is not the way to win us over.
GID00015165	Sure. Would you like a Stimpak, Fixer, or Rad-Away?
GID00015166	Well, now that Jacob is dead, we don't have the extra resources to make a surplus of medical supplies. Sorry, but we cannot spare anything now.
GID00015167	You'll need to wait another 24 hours for us to get more made. We need everything else we currently have.
GID00015168	You'll need to wait another 24 hours for us to get more made. We need everything else we currently have.
GID00015169	You'll need to wait another 24 hours for us to get more made. We need everything else we currently have.
GID00015170	Admission to the Strip requires an official passport or proof that you are carrying the required minimum balance.
GID00015171	These policies prevent less-reputable persons from entering and ensure a good time will be had by all who enter the Strip.
GID00015172	Thank you, sir. You may proceed.
GID00015173	Thank you, madam. You may proceed.
GID00015174	I'm sorry, but your balance does not meet the minimum balance.
GID00015175	Thank you, sir. You may proceed.
GID00015176	Thank you, madam. You may proceed.
GID00015177	Thank you, sir. You may proceed.
GID00015178	Thank you, madam. You may proceed.
GID00015179	[SUCCEEDED] <Various buzzing and clicking noises>
GID00015180	Thank you, sir. You may proceed.
GID00015181	[SUCCEEDED] <Various buzzing and clicking noises>
GID00015182	Thank you, madam. You may proceed.
GID00015183	[FAILED] Please submit to a credit check or present a passport.
GID00015184	If you are unable to meet the minimum balance requirement, an official passport is an acceptable alternative.
GID00015185	Charge? Ha ha. Pace must be at it again. What did he take you for?
GID00015186	Maybe so. Maybe so. You look like you might be able to handle yourself. Tell you what.
GID00015187	You do me a favor, and I'll have some more work for you when it's done. Sound good?
GID00015188	I did have something, but some friends of mine got whacked and now I got nothing for ya. Sorry about that.
GID00015189	I did have something, but a close friend of mine got whacked and now I got nothing for ya. Sorry about that.
GID00015190	Okay! You know where to go. See you soon!
GID00015191	Go all the way down to the Vault's main game room, take the hallway to your left and then the first room on the left-hand side. Enjoy your stay!
GID00015192	Okay. Anything else I can do for you?
GID00015193	Okay. Anything else I can do for you?
GID00015194	No, silly! Of course it wasn't always a hotel.
GID00015195	I have all sorts of things. Vault souvenirs, vault wares, vault machines, vault mementos and vault suits! And, well, lots of other vault things, too.
GID00015196	Hey, you there! I have a message for you.
GID00015197	It's from Ambassador Crocker. Very important. Here you go.
GID00015198	I see you brought a friend! Sorry, pardner, but they're gonna have to stay outside.
GID00015199	I see you brought some friends! Sorry, pardner, but they're gonna have to stay outside.
GID00015200	Come back soon, now!
GID00015201	Enjoy your visit!
GID00015202	Of course you haven't. Vegas always was one of a kind.
GID00015203	What you see down on the Strip is just a fraction of the city's former glory, and yet... more than an echo. I preserved its spirit.
GID00015204	Or perhaps you were referring to the Lucky 38? The years haven't been kind to her, but still she manages to impress.
GID00015205	Oh, come now - don't play the fool. Vegas has fools enough, a superfluity of them. They're what makes it so profitable.
GID00015206	They come to Vegas chasing penny-ante dreams of high-living, to feel like they're big shots, like they're winners.
GID00015207	You see that you and I are of a different stripe, don't you? We don't have to dream that we're important. We are.
GID00015208	You aren't going to ramble on about the virtues of life out in the wastes, are you? It's a desert, you do realize?
GID00015209	A radioactive desert where humans subsist in a barbaric state? Difficult to glorify convincingly. They are, however, aptly named.
GID00015210	For that's what you'd be out there - wasted. Here on the Strip, your talents can be put to use.
GID00015211	Oh, by all means - yes. That's refreshing.
GID00015212	The business is this. One of my employees has stolen an item of extraordinary value from me, and I want it recovered.
GID00015213	Simple enough?
GID00015214	You're ready to move forward, then?
GID00015215	Oh, don't be coy. You've been playing a high-stakes game ever since Victor dug you out of the ground. Don't be afraid to admit it.
GID00015216	I've resurrected Vegas, spirit intact. What I need now is the ability to enforce my rightful claim.
GID00015217	Not just against Caesar's Legion, by the way. In fact, the NCR is a more present and insidious threat.
GID00015218	To enforce, one must have force - a position of strength.
GID00015219	Years ago, when I detected NCR scouts roaming the Mojave, I could tell from their uniforms that these were no mere tribesmen.
GID00015220	I knew it was only a matter of time before an army appeared, to take control of the dam. And I knew my Securitrons wouldn't be enough to oppose them.
GID00015221	And so I recruited the Three Families. Vegas belongs to me because I mustered enough strength to bring the NCR to the bargaining table.
GID00015222	Indeed it was - and still is. But not without taking significant casualties.
GID00015223	Would Kimball and Oliver have traded the lives of hundreds of soldiers for absolute control of Hoover Dam? Oh yes.
GID00015224	They weren't afraid of me, they were afraid of Caesar - that attacking me would leave them vulnerable to a Legion offensive.
GID00015225	And so they negotiated. Not out of the kindness of their hearts, as they try to make it seem. Because the calculus of power left no other choice.
GID00015226	NCR forces were permitted to occupy Hoover Dam and establish a military base at McCarran Airport. Well, it used to be one.
GID00015227	They recognized my sovereignty over the Vegas Strip and agreed to supply electricity and water once their engineers repaired the dam.
GID00015228	Written into the treaty were provisions that the NCR do nothing to prevent its soldiers and civilians from visiting the Strip.
GID00015229	That's how I harnessed the NCR to my endeavor. Their occupation has been the engine of my growing economy.
GID00015230	The salient issue is that they will go to war with me, if given the chance.
GID00015231	There's just one reason why the NCR hasn't contrived some outrage to justify invading the Strip - Caesar's Legion.
GID00015232	The final battle between those two armies is fast approaching. I can't afford to let either side win on their terms.
GID00015233	New Vegas is more than a city - it's the remedy to mankind's derailment.
GID00015234	The city's economy is a blast furnace in which can be forged the steel of a new rail line, running straight to a new horizon.
GID00015235	What is the NCR? A society of people desperate to experience comfort, ease, luxury... A society of customers.
GID00015236	With all that money pouring in? Give me 20 years, and I'll reignite the high technology development sectors. 50 years, and I'll have people in orbit.
GID00015237	100 years, and my colony ships will be heading for the stars, to search for planets unpolluted by the wrath and folly of a bygone generation.
GID00015238	I prefer the term "autocrat."
GID00015239	I would rule as a chief executive. I would not answer to a board of directors or any other entity.
GID00015240	Nothing to impede progress. If you want to see the fate of democracies, look out the windows.
GID00015241	My judgement.
GID00015242	I have no interest in abusing others, just as I have no interest in legislating or otherwise dictating what people do in their private time.
GID00015243	Nor have I any interest in being worshipped as some kind of machine god messiah. I am impervious to such corrupting ambitions.
GID00015244	But autocracy? Firm control in the hands of a technological and economic visionary? Yes, that Vegas shall have.
GID00015245	Well enough. Return to me when you have the Platinum Chip in your possession. Any final matters for us to discuss?
GID00015246	My only concern is the recovery of the Platinum Chip. What happens to Benny, I leave to your discretion.
GID00015247	When you bring the Chip to me, I will pay you four times the delivery bonus stipulated in your contract. How's that?
GID00015248	As I said before, Benny's fate is yours to decide. Once you've delivered the Chip, I will pay you the amount agreed-upon.
GID00015249	Benny has led the Chairmen ever since I recruited his tribe seven years ago.
GID00015250	Until his recent misbehavior, I'd planned to make him my protege. Maybe if I'd begun grooming him sooner, none of this would've happened...
GID00015251	My offer far exceeds the original terms of your contract, which, I will remind you, already obligate you to deliver the Chip.
GID00015252	[SUCCEEDED] Very well, five times the bonus. Not one cap more.
GID00015253	[FAILED] Is that an attempt at... humor?
GID00015254	I've always taken business negotiations very seriously. I advise you to do the same.
GID00015255	It's a very special item. There's nothing else like it in the entire world. It was lost a long time, and difficult to find.
GID00015256	That's all you need to know about it, for this stage of our enterprise. Fulfill your contract, deliver the Chip, and good things will come your way.
GID00015257	Benny was the leader of the Chairmen for seven years, ever since I recruited the tribe. I considered him something of a protege.
GID00015258	I am Robert Edwin House, President, CEO, and sole proprietor of the New Vegas Strip.
GID00015259	I oversaw the city's renovations starting from 2274 onward. The Three Families are my employees.
GID00015260	Before the Great War of 2077, I was the founder, President and CEO of RobCo Industries, a vast computer and robotics corporation.
GID00015261	It's understandable that you'd be curious about this topic, but we'll hold off until the Platinum Chip has been recovered.
GID00015262	[SUCCEEDED] You might keep an eye out for any computers that Benny's been using. Maybe even a computer lab of some sort...
GID00015263	[FAILED] You have a contract to fulfill, a delivery to make.
GID00015264	If you can't hold to a contract, simply for the ethic of holding to a contract, you're worthless to me.
GID00015265	Don't let the video screens and computer terminals fool you. I'm flesh and blood, not silicon.
GID00015266	[SUCCEEDED] I see you've made a study of the topic. My knowledge of the science of longevity would fill several text books...
GID00015267	Perhaps, after a decade or two of economic reconstruction, I can commercialize these technologies and offer to others, such as yourself.
GID00015268	[FAILED] No. While brains demonstrated some use as organic processors in the robots produced by General Atomics International...
GID00015269	They never retained personality once removed from the human body.
GID00015270	Let's just say it was very... costly. But I was willing to make the sacrifices longevity entailed, financial and otherwise.
GID00015271	Until then.
GID00015272	So you've said before. You're making a habit of wasting my time.
GID00015273	You signed a contract in good faith to deliver that Chip. You're going to have a hard time on the Strip if you are so incautious of making enemies...
GID00015274	Please focus on the task at hand - for both our sakes.
GID00015275	No, you haven't.
GID00015276	This is the second time you've promised to deliver the Platinum Chip. Even if you don't hold yourself to your promises, I will.
GID00015277	Most of the town is rubble - destroyed during the Battle of Hoover Dam - and the only other thing around here is the concrete mixing yard.
GID00015278	The NCR has been constructing bunkers up and down the river. From what I've heard, it's a little late for that.
GID00015279	Travelers over at the 188 - just up the road - said that the Legion has overrun a couple of towns to the south.
GID00015280	You think you can take me, punk?
GID00015281	Normally, I'd turn you down since I have no idea who you are, but considering that the hostages are as good as dead when we attack...
GID00015282	All right, I'm going to give you a chance to talk to the Great Khans. Their leader is a man named Jessup.
GID00015283	If we hear shooting, we'll be coming in, but it'll probably be late for you.
GID00015284	As soon as you free them, the rest of my squad will move in and provide covering fire.
GID00015285	You should wait until it's darker so that you have the best chance to pull this off.
GID00015286	You should go now, while it's still dark. That way, you'll have the best chance to pull this off.
GID00015287	Good luck.
GID00015288	"Acceptable casualties," I've been told. I don't like it, but the brass has their reasons.
GID00015289	It was worth a try. I'll have to proceed with the attack as ordered, then.
GID00015290	Julie? Ah, I love Julie. She's such a nice lady.
GID00015291	One time, I was working on the water pump and she came over, put her hand on my shoulder, and told me I was doing a great job. Great job she says!
GID00015292	I just choked up and didn't say nothing. Compliments are so rare these days.
GID00015293	Drop drinking?! I've been drinking for a straight month!
GID00015294	Listen, I've tried to stop, but the withdrawal symptoms are so bad I feel like I'm going to die. I can't stop now.
GID00015295	Dixon sells me booze dirt cheap. It does the job, but it tastes like paint thinner and I feel like I'm going to die if I stop drinking for a day.
GID00015296	I swear that guy is trying to kill me, but what can I do? Drinking other booze doesn't cure the sickness like his.
GID00015297	What the hell? Why? I need alcohol, man!
GID00015298	I'm gonna die if I don't get a drink!
GID00015299	The only way you can help me now is a load of detox chems.
GID00015300	At least a couple doses of Fixer, a bottle of whiskey, and Rad-Away.
GID00015301	I can take doses of Fixer and Rad-Away to gradually flush my system over time while drinking decreasing shots of diluted whiskey.
GID00015302	This shit better be worth it, man.
GID00015303	I've felt like I was dying these past weeks off and on, but the worst is yet to come. In a few days though, I should be free.
GID00015304	I'll head over to the Followers and see if they will help me through this.
GID00015305	I've felt like I was dying these past weeks off and on, but the worst is yet to come. In a few days though, I should be free.
GID00015306	I'll head over to the Followers and see if they will help me through this.
GID00015307	I'd rather not waste the ammo, kid. But, if you insist, draw.
GID00015308	Now why the hell should I do that? You're below me, kid.
GID00015309	I've been killing scum twice your size since before your mother squeezed you out.
GID00015310	Piss off.
GID00015311	If you think you've got the guts, I'd like to see you try.
GID00015312	[SUCCEEDED] Well, that sounds like a bit of a bargain. I get to walk free with the Garrets thinking I'm dead.
GID00015313	Sure, you can have my hat. I can always buy another with the caps I've got left.
GID00015314	It would have been more fun fighting it out, though. See you later, kid.
GID00015315	[FAILED] <Glare> Better get your ass moving before your mouth gets you into trouble, kid.
GID00015316	Piss off, errand boy.
GID00015317	Piss off, errand girl.
GID00015318	Indeed, Santiago is a poet among pretenders. If you are here to collect for the Garrets, Santiago is debt free.
GID00015319	Yes indeed, Santiago is very important. I even have a discount at Mick & Ralph's.
GID00015320	Perhaps you could use Santiago's discount? For 50 caps, Santiago will tell you the super secret code word to get a discount with Mick.
GID00015321	Santiago thanks you. Tell Mick Santiago sent you and the code word is 'extravaganza'.
GID00015322	[SUCCEEDED] 25 caps will do. Tell Mick Santiago sent you and the code word is 'extravaganza'. He will set you up.
GID00015323	[FAILED] Sorry, my friend. 50 caps is the price to be a VIP.
GID00015324	Sir, Santiago does not know what he has done to offend, but he can explain everything.
GID00015325	Santiago is offended that you would opine such slander.
GID00015326	Ow! Okay. Here! Take the caps, just don't hurt Santiago again!
GID00015327	[SUCCEEDED] I didn't think she was upset enough to have me killed... Here are the caps I owe.
GID00015328	I do the Santiago act to get out of paying for services every once in a while. I didn't think it could possibly get me killed.
GID00015329	[FAILED]You think Santiago is susceptible to such idle threats? Santiago laughs at your silly bluff.
GID00015330	[SUCCEEDED] When did this happen?! Hey, look. I only do the Santiago bit as a way of getting free stuff. I didn't think it would get me in trouble.
GID00015331	Here is everything I have on me. Keep the extra for yourself! The last thing I need is a constant stream of bounty hunters after me.
GID00015332	[FAILED] You are not a VIP. You do not tell Santiago what he needs to do.
GID00015333	Leave me now. Santiago grows bored of this exchange.
GID00015334	Here are the caps I owe! No need for violence!
GID00015335	That all depends on who's asking.
GID00015336	Ow! What the hell was that for?!
GID00015337	Whoa, yeah. I guess the Garrets sent you after me? Look, I've got the caps right here, just don't hurt me.
GID00015338	Ah crap. I was hoping they'd forget about my tab. Look, I've got the caps right here, just don't hurt me.
GID00015339	Interest?! The Garrets said nothing about interest on their tabs. Look man, I've got the caps right here, just don't hurt me.
GID00015340	[SUCCEEDED] Okay! Here. That's everything I've got except the clothes on my back. I'm sorry about this.
GID00015341	[FAILED] Hey, I'm tapped out, man. I've got nothing left but the clothes on my back.
GID00015342	I won't. Thanks for not killing me.
GID00015343	Oh God! Help! Help!
GID00015344	[SUCCEEDED] Anything, take it! Just don't kill me, man!
GID00015345	[FAILED] You're freaking crazy. I'm not stripping for you. I'm already broke.
GID00015346	What? Thank you Mr. Obvious. I haven't heard that in a while.
GID00015347	What? Thank you Mrs. Obvious. I haven't heard that in a while.
GID00015348	<Twitches> My eye? A scum-humping water baron did this to me. No one talks trash about my eye.
GID00015349	That's it! No one insults the eye!
GID00015350	<Twitches> A scum-humping water baron did this to me. No one trash-talks the eye.
GID00015351	In that case, I suppose you're here to collect. I apologize, but I simply do not have enough caps on me to cover the debt.
GID00015352	If someone were to recover my caravan from that cave, I could easily pay in full, but who would bother with such a mess?
GID00015353	[SUCCEEDED] I'm short 90 caps or so, but I have a few cartons of cigarettes and some sensor modules I could put toward my debt.
GID00015354	At this point I'll have to return to California to start anew. I haven't got a cap to my name.
GID00015355	[FAILED] I don't even have enough caps to get a new caravan up and running. What makes you think I have enough to afford anything else of value?
GID00015356	Hey, you don't need to kill me. I'm going back to California to start over.
GID00015357	Just tell them you killed me and they won't be the wiser.
GID00015358	Oh God, no!
GID00015359	I swear they'll never see me again. After this experience, I want nothing to do with this hell hole.
GID00015360	I'll get started now. The last thing I need is more bounty hunters trying to track me down.
GID00015361	Santiago does not owe anyone. Santiago is a Freeside VIP.
GID00015362	I don't care how you handled those lumps of human refuse, but you got the job done. We need you to hunt down another person.
GID00015363	That son of a bitch McCaffery stole a ton of caps and ran off to Vegas. I guess the fact that we farmed out his usual work to you pissed him off.
GID00015364	No one steals from the Garret Twins! If you can kill that bastard and bring back as much as you can, you'll be paid very well.
GID00015365	I don't care how you handled those lumps of human refuse, but you got the job done. We need you to hunt down another person.

GID00015368	I don't care how you handled those lumps of human refuse, but you got the job done. For helping us out, we would like to set you up with a room.
GID00015369	You can have the corner room, rent free. It was McCaffery's.
GID00015370	Now that he's dead, we're happy to let you use it. Thanks for helping us.
GID00015371	I don't care how you handled those lumps of human refuse, but you got the job done. For helping us out, we would like to set you up with a room.

GID00015379	No one steals from the Garret Twins! If you can kill that bastard and bring back as much as you can, you'll be paid very well.
GID00015380	I don't care how you handled those lumps of human refuse, but you got the job done. For helping us out, we would like to set you up with a room.
GID00015381	You can have the corner room, rent free. It was McCaffery's.
GID00015382	Now that he's dead, we're happy to let you use it. Thanks for helping us.
GID00015383	I don't care how you handled those lumps of human refuse, but you got the job done. For helping us out, we would like to set you up with a room.
GID00015384	You can have the corner room, rent free. It was McCaffery's.
GID00015385	Now that he's dead, we're happy to let you use it. Thanks for helping us.
GID00015386	Doesn't look like it to me. I'm expecting 388 caps...
GID00015387	You're short. Come back when you have the rest.
GID00015388	It doesn't look like it to me. I'm expecting 600 caps...
GID00015389	You're short. Come back when you have the rest.
GID00015390	[SUCCEEDED] All right. 50/50 it is, but you better bring back all of the caps.
GID00015391	If we hear you crossed us, the next bounty hunter will be coming for you.
GID00015392	[FAILED] Who the hell do you think you're talking to? Keep talking like that and your ass is going to be in the gutter. 25%. Take it or leave it.
GID00015393	See the King. I'm sure he could work something out to get you in. You'll need to prove you're worth his time, but it'll be well worth it.
GID00015394	Good. Just stop on back when he's dead and you'll be rewarded handsomely. Bring his hat as proof of the kill.
GID00015395	Just bring back his hat if you decide to take care of him for us. He stole 2,000 caps.
GID00015396	I doubt much of that will be on him if you find him. If you kill him, keep whatever is on him, and I'll reward you for his hat.
GID00015397	Yes! Where is his hat?!
GID00015398	This is great news. No one screws with the Garret Twins and gets away with it. I need to find a place on the wall for this.
GID00015399	And for your reward... Here's 150 caps. I trust there were also some valuables on McCaffery. Also, we would like to set you up with a room.
GID00015400	You can have the corner room, rent free. It was McCaffery's. Now that he's dead, we're happy to let you use it. Thanks for helping us.
GID00015401	Interesting... Well, you're going to need to speak with my brother James. He handles all of the trading contracts and general operations.
GID00015402	Yeah, man. Those cats are out of their domes addicted to my shit. They can't get enough. Pretty hilarious to watch.
GID00015403	Really? Aw, you're such a saint.
GID00015404	You know what? I might be willing to stop if there is something in it for me.
GID00015405	300 caps and I'll stop selling to them. Otherwise, it is just too much fun watching them spiral downward.
GID00015406	Ooo, I always enjoy a good scrap!
GID00015407	Hey, nice doing business with you, Mr. Moneybags.
GID00015408	Good luck getting them healthy. If they don't get a whole lot of fixer soon, withdrawal will kill them.
GID00015409	Hey, nice doing business with you, Mrs. Moneybags.
GID00015410	Good luck getting them healthy. If they don't get a whole lot of fixer soon, withdrawal will kill them.
GID00015411	[SUCCEEDED] Wait, man! You can't go around saying shit like that!
GID00015412	Okay, I get your point. You won't have to worry about me supplying those two any more.
GID00015413	[FAILED] Wow, you really suck at this don't you? Go bully some molerats, jackass.
GID00015414	Heh, you sorry sad sack. Come back when you've got the caps.
GID00015415	Really now? This is news. We could possibly supply what they need, but they would need to supply us in kind.
GID00015416	They have the tech know-how to make our stills work more efficiently. Purer alcohol means we can get our customers drunk quicker.
GID00015417	Getting our customers drunk quicker means more caps spent at the tables and stuffing slots if you know what I mean.
GID00015418	Plus, the extra alcohol can serve as surgical disinfectant for their needs. The Followers are a good lot. They've stitched up our boys in the past.
GID00015419	Good. We can supply them with all the Med-X they need. For the Fixer, we'll only be able to send over some basic drug components.
GID00015420	We're not in the business of getting people off drugs, so we don't really dabble in that side of things.
GID00015421	The Followers should be able to whip some up with what we have available, though.
GID00015422	They just need to agree to fix up our stills and keep them maintained plus cover the cost for raw materials needed to make the alcohol.
GID00015423	Sure. Take a look.
GID00015424	Not for someone like you. My customers would shit a brick if they knew I sold anything to you.
GID00015425	If you need help cleaning up your rep around Freeside, I might be able to help... for a price.
GID00015426	Hey, that's great. We'll get some supplies sent over today as a show of good faith.
GID00015427	Once our stills are upgraded, we'll never be short on liquor for our patrons. If Jacob Hoff is sober, we might even have a few new drinks on tap.
GID00015428	Most might view us as drug dealing enablers around here, but honestly we care about our patrons. It's bad business for people to get addicted.
GID00015429	We've got enough crime in Freeside without a bunch of strung-out junkies robbing traders and gamblers to afford their next fix.
GID00015430	House may have boxed us out of the Strip, but we also don't have to deal with their bullshit.
GID00015431	I think now that the Followers are working with us, we'll be able to shape up Freeside a bit more.
GID00015432	With Jacob Hoff sobered up, there are new drinks are on the menu and sales are strong. People love the new Absinthe and Rum & Nuka.
GID00015433	Well, I wasn't expecting the increased NCR presence after the bombing to improve things, but I've been pleasantly surprised.
GID00015434	The off-duty chumps who have been wandering through have been stopping in to buy drinks and pay for strange. I appreciate the extra income.
GID00015435	The build-up of tension around the dam isn't making things safe, but it sure is bringing in a lot of hotheads looking to drink their worries away.
GID00015436	With the Kings dead, business is going a bit south. It's harder to get supplies into Freeside safely without their help.
GID00015437	We ain't scraping to get by, if that's what you're asking.
GID00015438	That's phenomenal! Who did you find?
GID00015439	They supply Freeside with drugs and liquor. From my point of view they're just better-organized pushers.
GID00015440	Upgrading their stills would increase their supply of liquor and chems. How does that help Freeside?
GID00015441	True, we could help addicts, but the cycle of addiction, recover, and relapse would remain.
GID00015442	Good point. We wouldn't be paying anything for their supplies, just a portion of our food waste to make ethanol.
GID00015443	We get food from nearby wasteland farmers in exchange for medical services, so we could put our caps back into helping Freeside.
GID00015444	Tell the Garrets we'll keep their stills running if they provide us with supplies. Thank you for arranging this. You've been a godsend.
GID00015445	Yes, Old Bill Ronte and Jacob Hoff. They're not going to kick their habits on their own.
GID00015446	Old Bill Ronte is an exceptionally skilled machinist. He could fix the problems we've been having with Freeside's water pump, if he sobered up.
GID00015447	The Garrets hooked Jacob on chems when he was working for them. Ironic, since he used to homebrew detox chems. He's a natural chemist.
GID00015448	The big man around here is The King. Not much happens in Freeside that he doesn't know about.
GID00015449	He has the most influence locally, and some of his crew haven't helped the situation by harassing NCR citizens and charging double for water.
GID00015450	Some NCR soldiers have been bringing in supplies, but none of it is going to Freeside locals. I've tried to speak to both sides to no avail.
GID00015451	In Freeside, the drunks and drug addicts flock in and around the Atomic Wrangler. I'd start there.
GID00015452	More than rough, it's a damn mess. Freeside townies are constantly picking fights with NCR civilians.
GID00015453	Thugs and thieves are always looking for a victim, and the local families are just sitting back making caps on the mess.
GID00015454	Freeside is in dire need, but no one has been man enough to step up. The Followers can only do so much to stem the tide.
GID00015455	There is always something needing done. A few souls here in Freeside could be great assets to the community, if they'd kick their addictions.
GID00015456	We need to get a regular supply of medicine organized, but the Crimson Caravan wants too many caps for what we need.
GID00015457	Lastly, tensions between the townies and NCR tourists have been going downhill fast lately. A lot of innocent people will get hurt if things blow up.
GID00015458	Sobering them up and putting them back to work would go a long way toward helping Freeside.
GID00015459	Go ahead.
GID00015460	Head on through.
GID00015461	Then go someplace else.
GID00015462	I guess you're not getting in here then, are you?
GID00015463	Could be. Could be. That kind of information doesn't come cheap, though. I'll need at least 150 caps for this one.
GID00015464	Could be. Could be. That kind of information doesn't come cheap, though. I'll need at least 150 caps for this one.
GID00015465	Much appreciated. The guys you're talking about have been spotted near the old train station in the northwest.
GID00015466	There've been more and more Squatters heading that way each night, too. Word is, there's a password to get into the building.
GID00015467	[SUCCEEDED] You're a scoundrel. I'll let it go for 50, but no lower.
GID00015468	[FAILED] How about 200 since you're such a smartass?
GID00015469	Much appreciated. The guys you're talking about have been spotted near the old train station in the northwest.
GID00015470	There've been more and more Squatters from around here heading that way each night, too. Word is, there's a password to get into the building.
GID00015471	Then I can't help you with that, but I do have lots of other tips that come much, much cheaper...
GID00015472	It'll cost you 250 caps.
GID00015473	[SUCCEEDED] Fine, fine. One hundred it is, but only because you're a good customer.
GID00015474	[FAILED] I've got a business to run here, you know. The price is 250.
GID00015475	Much appreciated. The guys you're talking about have been spotted near the old train station in the northwest.
GID00015476	There've been more and more Squatters heading that way each night, too. Word is, there's a password to get into the building.
GID00015477	Wow, I might have to head down to the Wrangler tonight with all these caps weighing me down.
GID00015478	Good luck!
GID00015479	Then I can't help you with that, but I do have lots of other tips that come much, much cheaper...
GID00015480	Handing out supplies? Like food and stuff? That ain't nothing to get ruffled over. You find anything else?
GID00015481	I got Rex here from a salvager a few years ago. He was a little dinged up when I got him, but one of the Followers fixed him right up.
GID00015482	He's been acting peculiar for some time now. I took him to the Followers and had him checked out, and they said his brain is bad or something.
GID00015483	He goes through spells like this from time to time. The Followers said his brain is going bad or something.
GID00015484	Sure, what's on your mind?
GID00015485	To understand Freeside, you have to look back a few years. Originally, we were all just tribes making a living in this area.
GID00015486	That all changed when Mr. House came around. He made an offer to the three biggest tribes that were willing to listen to him.
GID00015487	Today, everyone calls those tribes the Three Families, and they live in luxury and run their own casinos in the Strip.
GID00015488	The rest of us were left to fight over the crumbs, living in the shadow of those more fortunate. Things got pretty nasty for a while.
GID00015489	But we wanted more. A place of our own. A place where no one could tell us what to do. And we didn't want to go elsewhere to find it.
GID00015490	So we took control of this place, and made it our own. And that's really all Freeside is, the best of a bad situation.
GID00015491	We're different than other gangs, and not just because we dress better. We're not just a group of thugs looking for our next fight.
GID00015492	The Kings are about an idea, you see? Where every man is free to follow his own path, do his own thing. Where every man is a king in his own right.
GID00015493	No, they said they don't have the tools to help him.
GID00015494	For now, but they said eventually he's going to get worse. I don't know what to do.
GID00015495	I don't know. Maybe. If you found a way to help my poor Rex here, I'd be much obliged.
GID00015496	Your best bet would be to talk to Julie Farkas over at the Old Mormon Fort north of here. Maybe you'll have better luck than I did.
GID00015497	I can't thank you enough. Now, there's a few things you should know about ol' Rex here if you're going to be traveling together.
GID00015498	First, he hates rats. Can't stand the things. Giant rats, molerats, doesn't matter. He catches a whiff of one and he's off like a shot after them.
GID00015499	He's normally pretty obedient, but you might have to chase him some if he goes after one of the little varmints.
GID00015500	Second, he doesn't like hats, or the people wearing them. Don't ask. I have no idea why. Maybe because it rhymes with "rats".
GID00015501	That should be it, though. Other than the occasional bad spot when his brain starts hurting him, that is, but I'm hoping you'll see to that.
GID00015502	I wish you both luck. Take care of my Rex now, y'hear?
GID00015503	I completely understand. No reason you should take on someone else's problems. Let me know if you change your mind, though.
GID00015504	Now, was there anything else you wanted to talk about?
GID00015505	What about him?
GID00015506	Like what?
GID00015507	If the lock's too much for you to handle, reading through the magazine might give you the edge you need.
GID00015508	You'll need those to pick the lock. Be careful, though - put too much pressure on them and they'll snap.
GID00015509	Always happy to help someone down on their luck.
GID00015510	Oh. Well, go ahead and keep the stuff I gave you, anyway. It'll be more useful to you than me.
GID00015511	All right! We have an available room for you. That will be just 20 caps.
GID00015512	A special room for a special client!
GID00015513	For The Strip VIPs, like you, I've got just the right room - at half the price.
GID00015514	My shop's open for you, but not my Vault. I don't need trouble-makers staying at my home, no thanks.
GID00015515	Having you tonight is my pleasure. Your room is ready!
GID00015516	No, silly! Of course it wasn't always a hotel.
GID00015517	I grew up in it. I love it - my favorite place in the world!
GID00015518	Not that I know much of the world - I never left this place, come to think of it... but it is the most special vault, ever!
GID00015519	I have all sorts of things. Vault souvenirs, vault wares, vault machines, vault mementos and vault suits! And, well, lots of other vault things, too.
GID00015520	Well... it is my vault, all right. I mean, yeah. That is, no.
GID00015521	I take care of it but I suppose you could say that it belongs to Mr. House.
GID00015522	Take a look at this.
GID00015523	All right! What would you like to know?
GID00015524	I see. Okay, your move.
GID00015525	You do? That's wonderful! Let's see what you brought.
GID00015526	All right! That's going to net you lots of caps, my friend. Do you want to trade all your vault suits right now?
GID00015527	Go all the way down to the Vault's main hub. Your room's in the hallway to the left. Enjoy your stay!
GID00015528	Okay! You know where to go. See you soon!
GID00015529	Okay! How can I help you?
GID00015530	[SUCCEEDED] Well. Sure! You seem pretty special. But that will be our secret, okay?
GID00015531	[FAILED] What? A crappy... rat-hole!? My vault!? You are cruisin' for a bruisin', shuckster! The price stays.
GID00015532	Okay. See you soon!
GID00015533	Hey! Got any liquor on you?! I'm damn thirsty.
GID00015534	Hey. Thanks for helping me out. Being back and working really saved my life.
GID00015535	Here you go. I hope this helps.
GID00015536	Those rat-bastard Garrets stopped offering tabs. Now where the hell am I supposed to go for free drinks?
GID00015537	Friggin' troll NCR squatters. A bunch of mouth-breathing wastes of space, if you ask me.
GID00015538	Got any chems, sir? I need a hit quick!
GID00015539	Can't talk. Much work to do at the Fort and Atomic Wrangler.
GID00015540	I want you to back him up. See this through, and there'll be something good waiting for you when you get back.
GID00015541	Pace, I want you to take some guys down there and seize half of those supplies.
GID00015542	Rex, this is your new master. Protect him as you would me.
GID00015543	Rex, this is your new master. Protect her as you would me.
GID00015544	Excuse me, but a lady of my stature does not converse with those of low stock.
GID00015545	Nothing to worry about. If you had hired one of those other hacks, you'd be up to your ass in lowlife right about now.
GID00015546	To your left here is the Old Mormon Fort. You get roughed up, the Followers there will patch you right up. Not that I ever need their services.
GID00015547	Up ahead on the next block is where the Kings hang out. Don't let them scare you, if they don't outnumber you five to one you'll be fine.
GID00015548	Down to the right here is the fun part of town. You haven't seen Freeside till you've been to the Wrangler.
GID00015549	It's regrettable, but it looks like I'm about to lose another customer.
GID00015550	You idiot! What part of "play dead" do you not understand?
GID00015551	Well, here we are. No worse for wear, are you? I trust that if you need to cross Freeside again, you'll know who to hire.
GID00015552	Well, here we are. I trust you'll keep your mouth shut about the topic we were just discussing, or else.
GID00015553	That was rather invigorating, wasn't it? Let's keep moving, it's only a little further to the gate.
GID00015554	Gotcha! Thought you could ambush us, huh?
GID00015555	Just so you know, heading out here breaks our contract. This is why I ask people to pay up front. See you around.
GID00015556	You don't follow orders very well, do you? Oh well, more money for me.
GID00015557	Leave them to me!
GID00015558	Hmmm, I guess they were harmless after all. I'm not often mistaken, you know.
GID00015559	I'll scout ahead. You follow at a distance.
GID00015560	Hey, slow down. I don't like the look of some of those men ahead. Let's take a different way around.
GID00015561	I've got a few guys already waiting to go.
GID00015562	Hello, my friend.
GID00015563	Okay, that's it. Orris isn't paying us enough to put up with this shit. Let's just kill this one and be done with it.
GID00015564	Oh, boy, those clowns. Listen up, kid, and listen good, I don't care how many fancy Latin names he gives himself, a thug ain't nothin' but a thug.
GID00015565	Warlords and emperors? Don't make me laugh. At least they got enough brains to stay the hell out of New Vegas - Mr. House'd clean their clocks.
GID00015566	Sure, kid, like what?
GID00015567	I know I'm not the scheduled speaker, but I have a few words, if I may.
GID00015568	There was a time not so long ago when we were bound together not as members but as family. As a clan.
GID00015569	And when Mr. House came to us with his proposal, we accepted, knowing we stood to gain much.
GID00015570	Little did we know how much we'd lose in the process.
GID00015571	As a society, we've endeavored to sample the finest food and drink the world has to offer. But we are living a lie.
GID00015572	There is a meat sweeter than the most cornfed livestock. Most of you have tasted it. All of you have coveted it.
GID00015573	Among us, it is a crime to discuss a return to the old ways that unified our people.
GID00015574	Tonight, that all changes. The taboo ends. Let me finish, Marjorie.
GID00015575	You don't know it yet, but you are all now guilty of a greater crime. One that ordinarily bears the harshest of punishments.
GID00015576	Surely that you are all guilty warrants not only universal amnesty but also a renewed discussion.
GID00015577	For our society to be truly elite, we must dine on the most delicious, the most exclusive food known to us.
GID00015578	And tonight, for the first time as a society, you are sampling that very dish, the meat we are forbidden to taste, the way it was meant to be eaten!
GID00015579	Fellow members of the White Glove Society, bon appetit!
GID00015580	You get back here with our dinner!
GID00015581	What the- ? You son of a- ! Goddamn motherf- ! Ugh! Let me out!
GID00015582	Oh my god! Ted! Are you all right?
GID00015583	Quit your hollering. I'm fine.
GID00015584	Listen, Pa, we got to go after the White Shoes or whatever they're called. They're the ones responsible.
GID00015585	That may be true, but I wouldn't recommend it. He's built a reputation, and it isn't for calmness and impartiality.
GID00015586	He's not what he looks like. They call him "Hurricane Heck." The man built his empire by hiring mercenaries to drive off the competition.
GID00015587	Lately he's been attacking our Brahmin suppliers so he can take over their business.
GID00015588	He's the sort to pound in a nail with a wrecking ball. If you gave him the whole story on this he'd be liable to raze the entire hotel.
GID00015589	And God knows what he'd do to the rest of the Strip.
GID00015590	Right away.
GID00015591	But no one is in their chairs yet. Surely we should wait until 7 when the dinner guests arrive.
GID00015592	I'll be ready when you need me.
GID00015593	At once.
GID00015594	But no one is in their chairs yet. Surely we should wait until 7 when the dinner guests arrive.
GID00015595	I'll be ready when you need me.
GID00015596	Very well.
GID00015597	Confound it! I just don't know how I'm supposed to sleep knowing whoever done this got away.
GID00015598	All right. Well, I promised you I'd make it worth your while, so here you are.
GID00015599	Try not to lose it all at the same casino.
GID00015600	Well that does it! None of them maniacs will ever do business with Heck Gunderson long as they live.
GID00015601	Hell, I'll put me together a damn blockade. Hit 'em where it hurts.
GID00015602	They control the food? Well there ain't gonna be no food. Not for anybody in this whole damn town.
GID00015603	It's a goddamned monument to inhumanity. Let 'em starve. Biggest favor anyone's ever done this hellhole.
GID00015604	You better be right. Cause I got me a mind to wipe this town off the map if some of the folks running it are to blame.
GID00015605	Well who did this, if it wasn't the White Gloves?
GID00015606	The heck I don't! It's their support that gives these bastards power.
GID00015607	They all oughtta suffer for what they done. I just won't be satisfied with anything less. Wouldn't be enough.
GID00015608	My mind's made up on this. I'm cutting off the food supply to the Strip. They gotta learn their lesson the hard way, looks like.
GID00015609	[SUCCEEDED] I don't like this place. Whole Strip, really. Ever since I got here, the stink of it... it's flooded my nostrils.
GID00015610	But you got a point. They're already hell-bent on depravity here. All I'd be doing is helping them along.
GID00015611	Sometimes I got me so many ideas, it's a wonder they don't all just burst outta my head.
GID00015612	This town's headed to perdition anyway. I'm just giving them a little push.
GID00015613	[FAILED] No, that ain't enough. It ain't just him. It's this hotel. It's the whole damn Strip, and everybody who takes their money here.
GID00015614	I sensed it when I got here. This place is evil, pure and simple. Everyone did their part. Ted getting taken was just a symptom of the disease.
GID00015615	Why yes, of course. The White Glove Society is the most exclusive club in all of New Vegas. Perhaps the entire world.
GID00015616	It's only natural that you'd need a sponsor from within the club who can vouch for your good name.
GID00015617	Originally we didn't allow anyone else in, you see. Founding members only. We thought exclusivity would make us the envy of everyone who's anyone.
GID00015618	And it has. But then I had the idea to allow honorary members. Lower in status, naturally, but it just makes people want to be us even more.
GID00015619	And the right people could certainly do wonders for our image. Celebrities, philanthropists. We want only the very best.
GID00015620	I'm afraid you are a relative unknown. Certainly not the caliber of person we would consider for such an honor. Not yet, anyway.
GID00015621	If you had more notoriety or clout here on the Strip, things would be different. People need to have heard of you, and you must be well thought of.
GID00015622	And you most definitely fit the bill. Given your deeds on the Strip alone, I can safely say that you would be a prized addition to our honorary ranks.
GID00015623	Mmm. You'll have to look elsewhere, I'm afraid. The whole idea of "joining" the White Glove Society is pure hogwash.
GID00015624	You're either in it, or you're not. There's no joining.
GID00015625	This "honorary member" nonsense is just something Marjorie contrived because she's so preoccupied with image. But it's only a fad.
GID00015626	Once it blows over the riff-raff we've temporarily inducted will be shown the door. So I wouldn't hold out hope if I were you.
GID00015627	The answer is still no, I fear. You need to be the talk of the town, really. Think big! Your name should be on everyone's lips.
GID00015628	Come back then, and we shall welcome you with open arms.
GID00015629	Most definitely! You have become quite an impressive person in my estimation, and you are very well regarded here among those in the know.
GID00015630	You have my full support, and you are welcome to join us at our nightly banquets in our special section of the Gourmand.
GID00015631	I hope to see you there.
GID00015632	Kidnapped? That's ridiculous! And who said anything about eating anyone?
GID00015633	I know I didn't, because I hadn't gotten to that line of my speech yet. What remarkable timing you have.
GID00015634	What are you- ? Why is he there? Who are we eating right now?
GID00015635	Get them!
GID00015636	Get him!
GID00015637	Get her!
GID00015638	No! These are lies! I never kidnapped anyone. And even if I did, there's no harm done. He's alive, after all.
GID00015639	So be it. But we are all cannibals here. My death will be a constant reminder, and some day you will all remember.
GID00015640	You're all hypocrites! How can you claim to be connoisseurs yet deny yourselves the greatest of all meats?
GID00015641	I am ashamed to have once called everyone here family. This isn't over, though.
GID00015642	I'll begin anew. The White Glove Society will never achieve the greatness of my new order.
GID00015643	You'll all hear from me again.
GID00015644	Don't make eye contact with me! Look at the floor. And get back to work!
GID00015645	Oh really? So despite your filthy face and your vacant expression and your complete lack of human dignity, you're telling me you're not a server?
GID00015646	Who do-? Who the fuck do you think I am? I'm the fucking god of New Vegas brahmin fusion cuisine, that's who.
GID00015647	No. No. That doesn't even give me the credit I deserve. I fucking invented edible food!
GID00015648	Do you like eating? Good. You owe me your entire goddamned garbage existence.
GID00015649	I'll carve that stupid look off your inbred face!
GID00015650	Now get the hell out of my sight, or I'll bathe your face in the deep fryer.
GID00015651	Well then why the fuck are you still standing there like you aren't the lowest form of life ever to be flushed down the evolutionary toilet?
GID00015652	[SUCCEEDED] What, me? The supreme ruler of the Nevada dining scene? Teach lowlife half-wits to make food that doesn't smell like burning excrement?
GID00015653	Do you think it would sell?
GID00015654	Yes, of course.
GID00015655	[FAILED] There's nothing I'd like more than to hand the deepest secrets of my artistry to some idiot in exchange for a dirty handful of caps.
GID00015656	[FAILED] Yeah. You know why? It gets worse every time some sniveling wet blanket cries about how I need to tiptoe around his precious feelings.
GID00015657	[FAILED] Yeah. You know why? It gets worse every time some sniveling wet blanket cries about how I need to tiptoe around her precious feelings.
GID00015658	[?] What kind of harebrained fucking psychobabble bullshit is that?
GID00015659	I yell at people because I like yelling at people and because they fucking deserve it. Not because Mumsy and Daddy-kins didn't hug me enough.
GID00015660	Well what do you want? I'm very busy here.
GID00015661	[?] Oh. I see how it is. You think because my father walked out on us when I was five, now I have to yell at people.
GID00015662	Or because my mother was a deranged chem fiend who regularly brought strange men home who told me to call them uncle.
GID00015663	Or because my sisters would lock me in a shipping crate when they didn't want me around... and my brother...
GID00015664	God, I'd forgotten about that. How could they do that to me?
GID00015665	[SUCCEEDED] I... I can't stay here. I need to be alone.
GID00015666	Forget about the fucking banquet. You know what? You can do it. You be the star chef. Take my recipes.
GID00015667	It won't fill the hole, though. Just remember that. You'll always feel empty.
GID00015668	How could they treat me like that?
GID00015669	Well why don't you fucking try checking the serving table in the wine room, for fuck's sake? Circular room, two rooms down? Ring any bells? Christ!
GID00015670	Now don't speak to me again or I swear I'll serve you as the main course.
GID00015671	[SUCCEEDED] All right. Don't get me wrong, I love my job here, but they don't pay me what I'm worth. Too many people skimming off the top.
GID00015672	Take these. Should be plenty for a book in there. That's all I'm giving. Don't expect me to write some fancy introduction.
GID00015673	<grunts> You're pushing your luck. Here. I have a few copies on me. This better be good enough.
GID00015674	We're going to have a real problem if this thing isn't a hit.
GID00015675	Yes, of course.
GID00015676	[FAILED] There's nothing I'd like more than to hand the deepest secrets of my artistry to some idiot in exchange for a dirty handful of caps.
GID00015677	A hundred caps? I have that much between the cushions of my day bed.
GID00015678	Come back when you've got a serious offer.
GID00015679	[SUCCEEDED] No! It'll ruin my ingredients!
GID00015680	[FAILED] Now why the fuck would I do that? I don't have time for games. Stop wasting my time.
GID00015681	My daddy sent you?
GID00015682	Goddamn it, I almost died in here! What the hell took you so long? It's just one damn hotel.
GID00015683	Who did this to me, anyway? They hit me over the head before I got a look at 'em.
GID00015684	All right, fine. I'm right behind you.
GID00015685	What in the sam hell? Eat me? What kind of sick bastards would eat a person?
GID00015686	I'll tell you what. Soon as I'm out of here and my daddy knows the story, you can bet there ain't gonna be no White Hat Society no more.
GID00015687	To hell with that. You've seen those freaks. They dress the same, talk the same. You can bet they all eat the same, too.
GID00015688	They deserve what my daddy's gonna have coming for them.
GID00015689	I never liked them White Shoes in the first place. We'd be doing the Strip a service.
GID00015690	Let's go. I'll be right behind you.
GID00015691	Damn right, I'm right.
GID00015692	All right, let's get out while the getting's good.
GID00015693	All right, all right. But there's gonna be some justice one way or another. I'll see to that.
GID00015694	Let's go. I'll be right behind you.
GID00015695	The hell you will.
GID00015696	You're quite welcome. If you meet anyone who needs food or water in the area, please tell them about this place.
GID00015697	Yes, I'm a major in the supply corps, which is where this food and water comes from.
GID00015698	Interested in Politics, huh? Well, grab a seat and get comfortable.
GID00015699	I've been in politics quite a while now. Always had the drive to do it, even when I was young. It's just something I was drawn to.
GID00015700	I started my career over twenty years ago back in the NCR as the local mayor and worked my way up from there.
GID00015701	I managed President Kimball's first run for a seat on the Council. I suppose that's why I have this ambassadorship.
GID00015702	That's a conversation we might be able to have some day - once you've shown more respect for my country.
GID00015703	I can provide a quick history lesson, if that's what you're looking for.
GID00015704	In 2274, President Kimball sent the NCR army into the Mojave in force, with the objective of occupying and repairing Hoover Dam.
GID00015705	Rangers and army scouts had confirmed that the dam was basically unoccupied and could be restored to an operable condition.
GID00015706	Upon arriving at the dam, however, they discovered that a large force of tribals and robots had occupied it.
GID00015707	This was our introduction to the Three Families, the Securitrons, and, of course, Mr. House.
GID00015708	Using his Securitrons as intermediaries, Mr. House called for parlay.
GID00015709	He claimed his forces had occupied Hoover Dam in order to safeguard it for our arrival.
GID00015710	And that he was ready to turn it over to us, so long as we could agree to terms.
GID00015711	Those terms became the Treaty of New Vegas.
GID00015712	The Treaty recognized Mr. House's sovereignty over the Strip and granted us rights to establish military bases at the Dam and McCarran Airport.
GID00015713	The NCR is legally permitted to send 95% of the electricity produced by the dam to our home states.
GID00015714	The remaining 5% goes to the Strip.
GID00015715	The treaty actually makes it illegal for the NCR to prevent its citizens, or troops on furlough, from visiting the Strip.
GID00015716	Once on the Strip, our citizens are subject to arrest - or punishment - by House's Securitrons, though that's a rare occurrence.
GID00015717	Our troops enjoy a different status. It's illegal for the Securitrons to take action against them.
GID00015718	Of course, it's also illegal for our troops to carry firearms on the Strip, so there isn't much trouble they can get into.
GID00015719	Our military police does an adequate job of keeping the troops on furlough in line. I don't envy them that task.
GID00015720	The embassy was established a few weeks after the Treaty was signed.
GID00015721	Basically Mr. House handed us a dumpy little building he had no interest in renovating.
GID00015722	I'm the third ambassador to hold this post. And the first, I think, to accept its limitations.
GID00015723	My predecessors had ambitions of engineering the annexation of the Mojave. They thought they'd convince Mr. House to join up.
GID00015724	I've never even spoken to the man - or whatever he is. Maybe the situation will change once we've beaten the Legion once and for all.
GID00015725	You know where to find me.
GID00015726	If that's all you came here to talk about, you're wasting my time. Get to the point, or get out of my office.
GID00015727	I know you have a penchant for getting into trouble, but I'd recommend against that here. The Securitrons on the Strip aren't to be trifled with.
GID00015728	Perhaps I'll have Captain Pappas keep an eye on you. For your own safety, of course.
GID00015729	It's the same old stuff around here. Gambling, debauchery, drunkenness. It's all here. I'm getting a little old for it, however.
GID00015730	If you want more information try talking to some of the other guys around here. I don't get out of the office much anymore.
GID00015731	That's disappointing. They could have been a big help to us. I guess we'll just have to do without.
GID00015732	I'm glad you could make it! I have something that I wanted to discuss with you.
GID00015733	It's a very important matter, and I have a strong feeling that you're the perfect person for the job.
GID00015734	You received my message, good. I realize that it may seem a little strange that I'm contacting you, considering your reputation...
GID00015735	But I have a business proposition to discuss with you.
GID00015736	Ah, I see you received my message. Good, good - I had something important to discuss with you.
GID00015737	I'm going to keep this as simple as possible so we don't waste each other's time.
GID00015738	The NCR is in a bit of a tight spot with all that is going on with Mr. House and the Legion.
GID00015739	And despite your reputation and previous actions with the NCR, we could use your help.
GID00015740	I'm sure you've noticed that things are a little tense around here with all the issues between the NCR, the Legion, and Mr. House.
GID00015741	It doesn't take a genius to see that something big is going to happen soon.
GID00015742	To be honest with you, the NCR is in a tight spot. But... if we fail now, it's the people here that are going to suffer the most.
GID00015743	I'm not willing to let that happen, and I don't think you're the kind of person that would either.
GID00015744	Sorry to hear that. Do me a favor and give it some more thought. I'll be here if you change your mind.
GID00015745	That's excellent news! So they'll help us?
GID00015746	That's disappointing. They could have been a big help to us. I guess we'll just have to do without.
GID00015747	Excellent, come back after you've spoken to them. They should see the benefits of helping us in the long-term.
GID00015748	Much appreciated. Once you've talked to them, let me know what they have to say.
GID00015749	I'm going to keep this as simple as possible. The NCR is in a bit of a tight spot with all that's going on, and I need someone like you to help me.
GID00015750	In exchange for your help, you would receive complete amnesty for any past crimes against the NCR, as well as additional benefits and perks.
GID00015751	And if you prove to be a loyal and capable agent, well... let's just say there's a lot of work to be done, and the NCR is a good friend to have.
GID00015752	To the Northeast is a settlement. The locals here call them Boomers. They are sitting on a munitions stockpile that would be invaluable to us.
GID00015753	I would like you to get in contact with them, and then do whatever it takes to convince them to help us.
GID00015754	Someone with your background and reputation would have a better chance of reaching them than anyone I have available.
GID00015755	Excellent work. I can't tell you how useful that will be.
GID00015756	In any event, I have another assignment ready and waiting for you. But we can speak of it later.
GID00015757	Rest up, and when you're ready, speak to me again.
GID00015758	That's great. They're going to give us an advantage in the battle ahead.
GID00015759	Let me know as soon as you have an answer from them.
GID00015760	Oh... very well then. What else can I do for you?
GID00015761	Now we mostly just keep track of the NCR citizens and troopers around and make sure they don't get in trouble, but that's Captain Pappas' job.
GID00015762	I keep myself busy with paperwork and reports that get sent back to the NCR. It's mostly busy work, but every once in awhile, we make progress.
GID00015763	I was elected to this post seven years ago. I'm the third NCR representative to serve here in Vegas.
GID00015764	Now, I've had my share of ups and downs along the way, but I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.
GID00015765	That's it. Anything else you wished to know?
GID00015766	Oh yes, sure sure. Ask away.
GID00015767	This is the frontier of NCR territory, and we're the first line of defense. You won't find much in the way of civilization east of here.
GID00015768	South of here is Camp Guardian, but they've been having radio trouble so they've been silent for awhile now.
GID00015769	Ranger military outpost. We're keeping an eye on the Legion activities south of here at Cottonwood Cove.
GID00015770	Nothing going on down there at the moment - just the usual slave trafficking. Poor bastards.
GID00015771	Ring-a-ding! My card.
GID00015772	All right, well, if you change your mind, just let me know.
GID00015773	[SUCCEEDED] Well, now, you didn't hear this from Tommy, but Benny likes to go off on a bender now and then.
GID00015774	Usually he's only gone a couple days, but this last time nobody saw him for almost a month!
GID00015775	Ask me, I think he's got a dame from Gomorrah holed up in his suite, because nobody ever saw him leave it.
GID00015776	[FAILED] Oh, uh, it ain't even a thing. Forget I even said it.
GID00015777	Sure thing, baby. What can Tommy do for you?
GID00015778	It's cool, baby. Tommy's a forgiving fella.
GID00015779	Well, acts are a little bit thin on the ground right now, but every night from eight to midnight, we got the Rad Pack Revue!
GID00015780	Songs, dancing, jokes, we got it all!
GID00015781	Glad to hear it, baby! My card - pass it on if you see any good acts out there.
GID00015782	You know it, baby!
GID00015783	[SUCCEEDED] Ooh, a sharp customer! All right, all right, 5% it is.
GID00015784	[FAILED] I'm guessing you don't really know how this business works, kid. My offer is very generous already. Think about it.
GID00015785	Oh! He wants to kill Mr. House and use the Platinum Chip to copy my neuro-computational matrix onto the Lucky 38's mainframe.
GID00015786	That should give me control over all of Mr. House's defenses, most prominently his Securitrons. And then I just do what Benny tells me - easy-peasy!
GID00015787	Oh! He wanted to kill Mr. House and use the Platinum Chip to copy my neuro-computational matrix onto the Lucky 38's mainframe!
GID00015788	That would give me control over all of Mr. House's defenses, most prominently his Securitrons. And then I guess I just do as I'm told!
GID00015789	Sure! Benny had me look at it a bunch of times!
GID00015790	It's a data storage device, kind of like a holotape, but a lot more advanced! As for what's on it, well...
GID00015791	Some of Mr. House's data transmissions made it sound like the Chip could upgrade his defenses somehow!
GID00015792	That's just a guess, though! The Chip's a proprietary format! You'd need special hardware to read the data on it!
GID00015793	There are two locations with non-standard hardware on the network - the Lucky 38 and an underground facility at Fortification Hill. I'd look there!
GID00015794	Sure! Benny had me look at it a bunch of times!
GID00015795	It's a data storage device, kind of like a holotape, but a lot more advanced! As for what's on it, well...
GID00015796	Some of Mr. House's data transmissions made it sound like the Chip could upgrade his defenses somehow!
GID00015797	That's just a guess, though! The Chip's a proprietary format! You'd need special hardware to read the data on it!
GID00015798	There are two locations with non-standard hardware on the network - the Lucky 38 and an underground facility at Fortification Hill. I'd look there!
GID00015799	Oh, he had some help - a lady friend of his! She said something about living in a Fort over in Freeside... but that's all I remember!
GID00015800	This is Benny's workshop. When the Tops got renovated, he had this half of the floor blocked off for his own use.
GID00015801	I guess you could say it's my entire world! I don't think I've ever left this room! But that's okay - I'm not complaining!
GID00015802	It's what Benny always called me. Probably because I'm programmed to be so helpful!
GID00015803	As I understand it, I used to be just like all those other Securitrons out on the Strip.
GID00015804	But then my neuro-computational matrix was completely reprogrammed! To be nice! Very, very nice!
GID00015805	I was programmed to be helpful and answer any questions I was asked. I guess nobody bothered to restrict who I answer questions for.
GID00015806	That was probably pretty dumb, huh?
GID00015807	Sure! If the Chip can be used to reset administrator privileges, it'll be super-easy!
GID00015808	Benny? Ahh, he's an all right cat, you dig? He don't got much musical talent, but he knows how to run a business. When he's around, anyways.
GID00015809	Well, apart from serving as talent manager, show scheduler, and all-around man in charge of this fine theater, I happen to be its headline act.
GID00015810	Every night from eight till midnight, come on by to see the Rad Pack Revue live, only right here at the Aces Theater!
GID00015811	Now why would you want to go breaking Tommy's heart asking a question like that?
GID00015812	Here I run the finest entertainment venue in all New Vegas, and you're asking me "what else is there?"
GID00015813	Nothing close to what we got here at the Tops, that's for sure.
GID00015814	The cowboy act? Yeah, he dropped on in here not too long before you. He's got chops, baby, real chops, and I ain't just talking about that mustache.
GID00015815	And like we agreed, here's your fee. 3% of the cut comes to 100 caps. Don't spend them all in one place now - unless it's right here!
GID00015816	The cowboy act? Yeah, he dropped on in here not too long before you. He's got chops, baby, real chops, and I ain't just talking about that mustache.
GID00015817	And like we agreed, here's your fee. 5% of the cut comes to 166 caps. Don't spend them all in one place now - unless it's right here!
GID00015818	You talking about Mr. Isaac? Damn, baby, when you bring them in, you bring them *in!* That cat's gonna bring me money like you wouldn't believe.
GID00015819	Here's your 3%, baby. You enjoy that.
GID00015820	You talking about Mr. Isaac? Damn, baby, when you bring them in, you bring them *in!* That cat's gonna bring me money like you wouldn't believe.
GID00015821	Here's your 5%, baby. You enjoy that.
GID00015822	That comedian you mean? Yeah, he practically begged me to hire him. Didn't even haggle. Here's your 3%.
GID00015823	That comedian you mean? Yeah, he practically begged me to hire him. Didn't even haggle. Here's your 5%.
GID00015824	That comedian you mean? Yeah, he was a hell of a haggler. Cost me a pretty cap - hope he's worth it. Here's your 3%.
GID00015825	That comedian you mean? Yeah, he was a hell of a haggler. Cost me a pretty cap - hope he's worth it. Here's your 5%.
GID00015826	That ugly mug with the razor tongue? Dig it baby, he'll be one hell of a novelty act. Just like Tommy promised, here's your 3%.
GID00015827	That ugly mug with the razor tongue? Dig it baby, he'll be one hell of a novelty act. Just like Tommy promised, here's your 5%.
GID00015828	Well, it was my idea - well, me and the rest of the Rad Pack boys. We took it to Benny, and he thought it was a good idea.
GID00015829	A few years later, here we are - the best show in New Vegas!
GID00015830	Sure, baby, sure. Tommy's always looking for new talent to bring to the Aces.
GID00015831	Tell you what, you see any good acts while you're out wandering, give them my card. If they work out, I'll give you a 3% cut of the door.
GID00015832	Just swing back by as you recruit folks, I'll get you your bread.
GID00015833	Okay, 50 caps to make you scream.
GID00015834	Follow Me.
GID00015835	Your loss.
GID00015836	Get the fuck away from me. Don't ask me about Cachino.
GID00015837	Then leave.
GID00015838	I can pay you for it, of course. I also have some information about the Family's business that you might find interesting.
GID00015839	Between you and I we can break up what they're planning, maybe save some lives... Mine included, of course.
GID00015840	Oh, here are some caps. Now give me the journal. Right, there we go. So let me tell you what I know about the Family's business.
GID00015841	The Bosses, Big Sal and Nero, have been working for a while on this. They're arming themselves like an army, using this new guy, Troike.
GID00015842	They also brought in a specialist named Clanden. At least that's what they introduced him as.
GID00015843	I can't stop you, but that's gonna mean my death. I can make it worth your while to give it to me though.
GID00015844	Plus, if you go to the bosses I can't help you stop what they've been doing.
GID00015845	All right, all right. I can't stop you, but I think we can help each other out.
GID00015846	I know Not-At-Home and the NCR would be happy to get some dirt on the Family. I can help you get that dirt, and you got me by the short hairs.
GID00015847	[SUCCEEDED] Okay, you got me by the balls. Here's a couple hundred caps, maybe that'll buy your friendship.
GID00015848	[FAILED] Do I look like some kind of fool? I'm not paying you so you can double deal on me.
GID00015849	You wanna come into a back room and give me a chance? Didn't think so.
GID00015850	Much as I'd love to put my fist through your neck, Mr. House frowns on that kind of behavior, so it'd get me killed just as quick as that book.
GID00015851	Oh? Is that so, well I can't say that I'm sad to see that fucker gone.
GID00015852	I got no fucking idea. They let him have the run of the place though. He seems like a nice guy, but he makes nervous.
GID00015853	He's a little arrogant, but he's too nice. Too open, I've never seen him fucking or gambling. Everyone has a vice, but this guy seems like the Pope.
GID00015854	He's a skittish little fucker. Spends half the day pumping his body full of chems and the other half pumping hookers with his willy.
GID00015855	He has some kind of connections, so he's able to smuggle huge shipments of weapons into the strip.
GID00015856	The bosses got him by the short hairs. We covered up a hooker he killed while flying on some psycho, so he gets us guns in exchange for not ratting.
GID00015857	You took care of Troike already, you don't need to worry about him.
GID00015858	No, just that it involves guns and muscle. Also that it's big. Very big. Only Nero and Big Sal know everything, and they ain't telling.
GID00015859	Okay. You can find me here, or upstairs in my room. I'll let the muscle know you're a friend of mine, that should let you get around a little easier.
GID00015860	Okay toss 'em at me.
GID00015861	Knowing the Khans, they were probably drugged up to hell and back.
GID00015862	We'll take it from here and sort things out. Thanks for trying to help us out.
GID00015863	Right... probably just bad luck.
GID00015864	You were supposed to negotiate for the safety of my troopers, damn it.
GID00015865	I don't really know what else I can add. They were a bunch of guys. Better dressed than most Freesiders, I guess. That help?
GID00015866	I don't know, man! Maybe you're with the guys who attacked us and want to know if we can ID them.
GID00015867	Nah, they'd probably just come over here and kick our asses again.
GID00015868	Well, I don't know anything else. Sorry.
GID00015869	Sorry I couldn't help more, especially since you're being so nice.
GID00015870	Hey wait! I just remembered something. I might of heard one of the guys that attacked us call another by name.
GID00015871	We had just about had it when one of them said "Hey Lou, we gotta go." At least I think he said Lou. It might have been something else.
GID00015872	Now that I think of it, he said Lou-something. Something with a "T". Tenant! That's what he called him. Lou Tenant.
GID00015873	Oh. That's different then. How can I help? I'll do anything to get the bastards that did this.
GID00015874	Well, it happened at night. Around eleven. We had recently made some caps off a bit of scrap we found, and wanted to invest it wisely.
GID00015875	As we were leaving the Wrangler, we must've taken a wrong turn, and ended up in the Squatter side of town.
GID00015876	From out of nowhere, these big guys show up and start barking questions at us. Wanted to know if we were locals.
GID00015877	The kid there's about as proud as a local around here gets, and started yelling back at them. Then all hell broke loose.
GID00015878	Kid got the worst of it, sad to say.
GID00015879	They were big guys. Young, too. No old geezers like me. Hell, none of them looked even half my age.
GID00015880	I was mostly face down in the dirt, begging for my life when it happened, so I only got a quick look at them.
GID00015881	I hope you find the bastards that did this. If you want, try asking my friend Wayne over there about them. He saw more than I did.
GID00015882	Just look around. People here are as like to stab you as say hello. That is, if I weren't at your side.
GID00015883	Two hundred caps gets you my watchful eye for a trip to the south gate.
GID00015884	Sorry, but all the people with real money are heading for the Strip, so that's the way I go. You want to go somewhere else, hire one of these losers.
GID00015885	I'm sure Freeside will disabuse you of that notion soon enough. Farewell.
GID00015886	Done and done. I want to mention a few things up front. In order to ensure your safety, I need you to follow my instructions to the letter.
GID00015887	We'll be heading down the main street here the whole way down. No detours. You go off sightseeing and I go off to find another customer.
GID00015888	I'll keep a brisk pace, so try not to fall behind. Now let's head out.
GID00015889	One of his boys stopped in and said you had won the King's favor. You've done right by this town and deserve a pass. Here you go.
GID00015890	See ya.
GID00015891	Stop back in if you need anything.
GID00015892	[SUCCEEDED] All right. Yeah, I've got a little side business going, but what I'm about to share with you does not leave this room, eh?
GID00015893	Over the years, I've gradually perfected my craft to the point of perfection. No one can distinguish between my work and the real thing.
GID00015894	What I'm referring to is passports. If you've got the caps, I can whip up a Strip passport which will fool even the most well-trained eye.
GID00015895	[FAILED] Wow, you're a real wordsmith there, bub. Sorry, talk to the leaders of Freeside if you want the deal.
GID00015896	Hey, if you're interested and have the caps, they go for 500. Any less and it ain't worth the risk of getting caught.
GID00015897	What do you say? You game?
GID00015898	No problem. If you need one later, just stop in.
GID00015899	Here you go.
GID00015900	Here you go.
GID00015901	[SUCCEEDED]Hah! I like your style, kid, but the best I can do is meet you halfway. 375 caps, and we can call it a deal.
GID00015902	[FAILED]Heh, who are you shitting?
GID00015903	I appreciate your brass, but 500 is the price. Take it or leave it.
GID00015904	500 caps and it's yours.
GID00015905	375 caps and it's yours.
GID00015906	You're kidding me, right? No, from the look in your eye I can tell you're not kidding. Wow, you should really be more careful with your money.
GID00015907	Here, this should cover it. So there's no hard feelings.
GID00015908	Now, I'm guessing you really wanted to talk business if you were willing to drop that much cash to see me.
GID00015909	Now, what can I do for you?
GID00015910	You're modest. I respect that. So what can I do for you?
GID00015911	Pace must be losing his touch. Either that or you're a smooth one. So what can I do for you?
GID00015912	I might just be able to help you with that. But it's not something I do easily, or often. You'd have to earn it. You willing to do that?
GID00015913	I'll start you off with something easy. Did you notice the bodyguards for hire near the gates when you entered Freeside?
GID00015914	Then I wish you luck. But know that there are only two ways in there, me or those robots. Good luck working things out with the tin cans.
GID00015915	It's good money if you can stay alive long enough. Freeside's not as safe as it used to be, so the money is well earned.
GID00015916	Usually well earned, that is. Recently my men tell me that one of those bodyguards, fella named Orris, is making a little too much money.
GID00015917	He's making a killing in repeat business. Once someone hires him they never want anyone else. I want you to find out why.
GID00015918	Specifically, I want you to hire him. Play the part of an innocent tourist and follow his lead.
GID00015919	If nothing happens, so be it. But I'm guessing things won't go so smoothly. Call it a hunch. So what do you say?
GID00015920	It's good money if you can stay alive long enough. Freeside's not as safe as it used to be, so the money is well earned.
GID00015921	Usually well earned, that is. Recently my men tell me that one of those bodyguards is getting a suspiciously large amount of business.
GID00015922	The man's name is Orris, and everyone who hires him specifically requests him when they return. I want you to find out why.
GID00015923	Specifically, I want you to hire him. He's usually covering the northern gate. Then I want you to head for the southern gate.
GID00015924	If nothing happens, so be it. But I'm guessing things won't go so smoothly. Call it a hunch. So what do you say?
GID00015925	Okay, then. Once you part ways, return here. I'll look forward to hearing your report. Oh, and take this to cover the hiring cost.
GID00015926	You may have noticed that some of those guards out there are Kings, too. I'm just looking out for my men.
GID00015927	I'm not trying to get some kind of unfair advantage. I just want a level playing field for my boys. So what do you say?
GID00015928	I've tried, but he can smell a King a mile away. Probably knows all our faces by now. He's not a stupid man, I'll give him that.
GID00015929	What I need is someone he won't recognize, which makes you perfect.
GID00015930	So are you going to take the job or what?
GID00015931	That's too bad. We could have helped each other out. If you change your mind, stop back. The job might still be waiting for you.
GID00015932	So that's how it happens... Okay, then. I'll have some guys pull him off the street when no one's looking.
GID00015933	You've shown me something, so maybe you can help me with a matter that's a little more important.
GID00015934	A lot of folks round these parts who've been here a while resent the sheer number of people that have come into the area since the Strip was built.
GID00015935	In turn the newcomers, most of whom come from the NCR, have gotten ornery from being resented. Sometimes things get violent.
GID00015936	This is one of those occasions. Recently, a few friends of mine were attacked, and I want you to find out who did it.
GID00015937	Word's come that they just woke up over at the Old Mormon Fort just north of here. Head on over and see if they remember anything.
GID00015938	Oh he did, did he? Well that just ain't good enough. Get back out there and hire him again. Hire him a hundred times if that's what it takes.
GID00015939	And before you ask, I'm not gonna cover the cost this time. It's bad enough I'm giving the man *more* business.
GID00015940	Ah, so it went down like that, huh? I guess it can't be helped now.
GID00015941	You're not subtle, but you get the job done. That's good enough for me. Maybe you can help me with something more important.
GID00015942	We've actually already met. It is good to see you again.
GID00015943	It's a pleasure to meet you. I appreciate what you've done so far in the interest of peace in Freeside.
GID00015944	Please bear in mind that there may be more to this situation than there seems. The reasons for these attacks are yet unknown.
GID00015945	It may be possible to avoid further bloodshed if you discover the cause at the root of this recent outbreak of violence.
GID00015946	Huh. Well, yeah, okay, these are Benny's brand, and they ain't too common. You got anything else?
GID00015947	Yeah, that looks like Benny's lighter all right. Still, not exactly a ton of proof. Got anything else, kid?
GID00015948	That's... pretty shady, yeah. Could be Benny's up to no good, could be this is somebody else altogether. What else you got?
GID00015949	Creepy bunch of cats, you ask me. Oh, sure, they act all polite and civilized, but there's something off about them, you dig?
GID00015950	Don't get me wrong, that resort of theirs is ring-a-ding, but my guts say, "don't go in the basement."
GID00015951	I'll tell you what I think, I think I oughta go tell Benny about this right now - but I'll clam up for now.
GID00015952	That's all I'm going to do, though, unless you can get me some more proof.
GID00015953	I think you might just be onto something here, kid. Tell you what, I can't actively back your play, but I'll keep the Chairmen off your back.
GID00015954	I'll tell the doormen you're cool to pack heat inside - trust me, you're gonna need it.
GID00015955	You'll still have to deal with Benny's private goon squad, though. I got no play with those cats. You want more help, I'll need more proof.
GID00015956	Jesus, kid, I think we got a real problem on our hands. Can't believe Benny's a no-good stinkin' punk. Trying to play House like that....
GID00015957	Tell you what - I'll call Benny, keep him away from his suite. You go search the place. Here's the key, it's on the 13th floor.
GID00015958	It's the room with the double doors, can't miss it. Maybe you'll find something we can show to Mr. House and get him arrested.
GID00015959	Groovy. Here's your stuff back - in case you run into company, you dig? I'll tell the boys to give you a pass to pack some heat.
GID00015960	Go on then. Elevators are past the slot machines on your left.
GID00015961	Yeah, thought so. You're a smart kid, you know that?
GID00015962	Take him out? Jesus... okay, well, if you think that's the best way to deal with this. I'll send him up to his room, you can ambush him there.
GID00015963	And don't worry about the rest of the Chairmen - I'll keep them from getting involved. You'll still have to watch out for Benny's guards, though.
GID00015964	Huh? What are you talking about?
GID00015965	[SUCCEEDED] Huh? What are you talking about?
GID00015966	[FAILED] Why you lousy no-good punk! Give me one reason why I shouldn't take this to Benny right now!
GID00015967	Anybody ever tell you your sense of humor stinks? I'll let it go this time, but you watch your mouth from now on.
GID00015968	Pal, you're gonna regret that for the rest of your very short life.
GID00015969	That doesn't... why would he pull a stunt like that? Got anything else to offer?
GID00015970	[SUCCEEDED] That doesn't... why would he pull a stunt like that? Got anything else to offer?
GID00015971	[FAILED] Kid, I think you really better shut up and stop making baseless accusations unless you got some proof. Well?
GID00015972	He's trying to pull a fast one on the big man? Crazy bastard. You got any more?
GID00015973	[SUCCEEDED] He's trying to pull a fast one on the big man? Crazy bastard. You got any more?
GID00015974	[FAILED] Kid, that doesn't even pretend to make sense. You want to try again?
GID00015975	Jesus, I can't even believe it. After all House did to set us up with this swank joint. I don't suppose there's more?
GID00015976	[SUCCEEDED] Jesus, I can't even believe it. After all House did to set us up with this swank joint. I don't suppose there's more?
GID00015977	[FAILED] Now you're just talking crazy. No way Benny'd risk something like that. What else you got?
GID00015978	Oh, they're a shifty pack of rats. If I were you, I'd keep one hand on my wallet and the other on my gun whenever they're around.
GID00015979	House is an all-right kind of guy. Sure, he keeps a pretty tight grip on the reins, but Vegas is a wild horse, and you can't just give her her head.
GID00015980	Without Mr. House, we'd still be wearing gecko skins, poking around the ruins with pointy sticks and scalping people for giggles.
GID00015981	Baby, we're only the coolest cats on the whole Strip. We been here the longest, we got the swankiest digs, and we got caps rolling in like the tide.
GID00015982	Everybody loves the Chairmen, because we show them a simple good time, no strings attached.
GID00015983	Man, we're only the coolest cats on the whole Strip. We been here the longest, we got the swankiest digs, and we got caps rolling in like the tide.
GID00015984	Everybody loves the Chairmen, because we show them a simple good time, no strings attached.
GID00015985	You might have a jaw at Tommy Torini up in the Aces. He's always looking for talent scouts.
GID00015986	Ooh, I dig the way you think, doll. Here, go treat yourself.
GID00015987	Sure, whatever you want.
GID00015988	All right, well, might want to get a move on, is all I'm saying.
GID00015989	Huh. Guess that makes me the boss. Ring-a-ding.
GID00015990	I hope so, kid. Last thing we need is that punk running around out there.
GID00015991	Yeah, sure. Take your stuff back - you'll need it.
GID00015992	Go on then. Elevators are past the slot machines on your right.
GID00015993	Here's your stuff back - in case Benny don't go quiet, you dig? I'll tell the boys to give you a pass to pack some heat.
GID00015994	Go on then. Elevators are past the slot machines on your right.
GID00015995	Go on then. Elevators are past the slot machines on your right.
GID00015996	Okay. Just let me know when you're ready.
GID00015997	Yeah, sure. I hope you know what you're doing, kid.
GID00015998	You got it. Anything else?
GID00015999	You don't know? <Sighs> Good. That's good. So they didn't send you after me.
GID00016000	Where's the gentleman I'm supposed to meet?
GID00016001	So was the man I'm supposed to be meeting here. Where is he?
GID00016002	Matchbook? What about the man I gave it to?
GID00016003	Oh my goodness me! They must know he was talking to someone on the inside.
GID00016004	They'll be watching everyone closer now. I knew this was a mistake.
GID00016005	The devil he did. He was supposed to meet me days ago. Are you in Mortimer's employ, then?
GID00016006	Not for long.
GID00016007	Mortimer. If he realizes it was me the investigator was planning to meet, he'll have me killed.
GID00016008	The girl. The one who disappeared. I know what happened to her.
GID00016009	Yes. The White Glove Society strictly forbids eating humans. But we weren't always the White Glove Society.
GID00016010	Mortimer and some of the others have... regressed... to the old ways.
GID00016011	They've taken many people over the last few months. But always from Freeside or secluded places, where they wouldn't be missed.
GID00016012	It wasn't enough. Lately they've gone for tourists here on the Strip. Even in the hotel.
GID00016013	I guess that's the hazard of a cannibal becoming a gourmet - it's hard to please a refined palate.
GID00016014	Because I distracted her fiancee while they took her. Well, I'm not proud of it! But I had to. They could see I was having second thoughts.
GID00016015	Some of the White Gloves began meeting privately a while back. Started talking about how we'd lost our identity.
GID00016016	I started attending because I thought it was about changing our politics.
GID00016017	Then they started talking about returning to the old ways, and there was no way out. They'd kill me for the things I'd heard them say.
GID00016018	He's alive, as far as I know. They're trying to keep him fresh. Mortimer has special plans for him.
GID00016019	The White Glove Society has a banquet every night at 7. It's in our private section.
GID00016020	Mortimer wants to reintroduce humans into our cuisine. Since eating people is a crime we punish by death, he's going to do it in secret.
GID00016021	After everyone has eaten it he'll tell them.
GID00016022	With no real way to punish everyone, in Mortimer's mind, anyway, their minds will be open to the idea of eating people as a delicacy.
GID00016023	They might. But to him the legacy of returning to the old ways is worth his own life. I don't think he expects it, though. I don't, either.
GID00016024	Nothing is more important to the Society than to be on the cutting edge of New Vegas cuisine. Mortimer's idea will appeal to that need.
GID00016025	He just has to get them over the taboo.
GID00016026	I don't know exactly. I wasn't in on it. I think some of them have stopped trusting me.
GID00016027	But you can bet they're keeping him near the Gourmand. Our chef, Philippe, has an obsession with fresh ingredients.
GID00016028	It'd be back in the members only section, so you'll have to be careful. Don't be seen, and more importantly, don't let them see Ted in the open.
GID00016029	It's guarded both at the lobby entrance and in the access tunnels leading from the main restaurant.
GID00016030	I... could sponsor you as an honorary member. But I don't know that you've achieved the level of status that would gain the Society's approval.
GID00016031	Perhaps if you were to gain some more notoriety on the Strip, we could get you in.
GID00016032	I... could sponsor you as an honorary member. The White Gloves are always looking for people who can elevate their status.
GID00016033	You'd certainly fit the bill with everything you've done around here.
GID00016034	Otherwise, you'll have to find some way to get inside quietly. It won't be easy. And it'll be harder still to get him out.
GID00016035	Hmm. Well, they'll all be sampling Pre-War wines before the meal. Maybe it's as simple as drugging them.
GID00016036	Although... that wouldn't stop any future kidnappings. You'd have to expose Mortimer. But he's going to confess anyway...
GID00016037	What if... what if his revelation were a lie? What if no one had eaten human flesh but him?
GID00016038	If you could somehow replace Philippe in the kitchen and serve a convincing substitute instead...
GID00016039	You could walk Ted right through the middle of that room after Mortimer speaks. And then he'd have some explaining to do.
GID00016040	Philippe has been trying to approximate the taste of human flesh for years. He must have a recipe somewhere.
GID00016041	What!? No, please! Here, take the caps but please don't hurt me!
GID00016042	Most people don't, uh, understand what it means to grow up in a vault. Its corridors, its walls, radiate a warmth that feels, safe, honest.
GID00016043	But here everything is huge and threatening - so empty that I think one of these days I'll just... snap.
GID00016044	It's this place - my inspiration ebbs and I don't know how to stop it! I can't feel the warmth anymore...
GID00016045	Well, I, uh, not much, really. Vault 21 was my home, my dear home. I left it to explore the outside world.
GID00016046	At first it was a marvel to behold. My inspiration flowed true and its works caught Mr. House's attention. That's how I ended up in this... place.
GID00016047	[SUCCEEDED] I should've known that Mr. House wouldn't have sent just anybody. Anything I might I offer to, well, encourage discretion?
GID00016048	Wait a minute... Do you even know what I do here? Who are you, really?
GID00016049	[FAILED]Sorry excuses?.. That's does it! Tell Mr. House to hire a better artist, if he can find one in this barren wasteland!
GID00016050	You were, really? Okay. For a moment I thought you were going to tighten my screws - like everyone else around here.
GID00016051	[SUCCEEDED] Yeah, I imagine that it takes a lot to fill the void of such a bottomless soul. Take the caps and leave me to my sorrows.
GID00016052	[FAILED] What!? I don't get paid near enough to what my talent deserves!? A 150 caps is my final offer.
GID00016053	What!? No, please! Here, take the caps but please don't hurt me!
GID00016054	[FAILED] I know important people here in the Strip. Powerful people. You, uh, can't get anything out of me.
GID00016055	Here. Now, please leave me be. I have had enough bullying for today.
GID00016056	Here. Now, please leave me be. I have had enough bullying for today.
GID00016057	Because spending myself to the edge of artistic oblivion for Mr. House sums up my existence since I had to leave Vault 21, that's why.
GID00016058	[SUCCEEDED] Ah, an educated fellow? Now that is almost as rare as artistry! So, how can you help me regain my inspiration?
GID00016059	Maybe you are thinking of Agoraphobia? Yes, you are right. I need something to bring back my inspiration. Any ideas?
GID00016060	Yes, I think so... But, please, uh, keep quiet about it. Without inspiration I am as good as a tumbleweed drifting in the barren wasteland.
GID00016061	I feel haunted by something terrible. Working in such a huge workshop often makes me shiver... I can't even leave the Strip!
GID00016062	Wouldn't that be great... No - Mr. House filled it with concrete. Only a few rooms and halls remain. My sister was able to turn them into a hotel.
GID00016063	It's this place - my inspiration ebbs and I don't know how to stop it! I can't feel the warmth anymore...
GID00016064	You were, really? Okay. For a moment I thought you were going to tighten my screws - like everyone else around here.
GID00016065	[SUCCEEDED] Yeah, I imagine that it takes a lot to fill the void of such a bottomless soul. Take the caps and leave me to my sorrows.
GID00016066	[FAILED] What!? I don't get paid near enough to what my talent deserves!? A 150 caps is my final offer.
GID00016067	What? Are you serious? I am an artist! I need inspiration, not therapy.
GID00016068	Stop right there!... I'm sorry, but there's nothing wrong with my brain. What I need is something that inspires ideas back into my work.
GID00016069	I... what does this have to do with my - never mind! I just can't go outside, get it? There has to be another way.
GID00016070	Thank you for the offer but I think I really can't go to see... wait a minute. I know! I don't have to necessarily be there to see it.
GID00016071	Yes. Yes! That's it! I have a camera! It is old but it should work. Perhaps you could bring me images of inspiring landmarks?
GID00016072	I always wanted to see the Dinosaur and its Thermometer sign at Novac. Then, there's the famous Bison Steve sign.
GID00016073	The McCarran Airfield and the Helios One power station signs are of much interest to my work - like the Sunset Sarsaparrilla Headquarter's bottle.
GID00016074	There's an opportunity for profit anywhere, uh? Even if it means preying on the helpless. Okay, you... shuckster - 150 caps each if they are good.
GID00016075	What!? No, please! Here, take the caps but please don't hurt me!
GID00016076	Thank you! I really can't thank you enough for this. Please, get me all the pictures. I will compensate you accordingly.
GID00016077	Oh, and if you need more camera film then just come back and I will get it for you. Again, thank you!
GID00016078	Oh, that's wonderful! Just what I need. Thank you, brave one! Here's some compensation for your work.
GID00016079	I always wanted to see the Dinosaur and its Thermometer sign at Novac. Then, there's the famous Bison Steve sign.
GID00016080	The McCarran Airfield and the Helios One power station signs are of much interest to my work - like the Sunset Sarsaparrilla Headquarter's bottle.
GID00016081	What!? No, please! Here, take the caps but please don't hurt me!
GID00016082	Now that you have all you care for, please... leave, and don't come back!
GID00016083	Aaaaahhhhh - Help!
GID00016084	I am Sheldon, from Vault 21, although here I go by my artistic name, "Michael Angelo."
GID00016085	Most people don't, uh, understand what it means to grow up in a vault. Its corridors, its walls, radiate a warmth that feels, safe, honest.
GID00016086	But here everything is huge and threatening - so empty that I think one of these days I'll just... snap.
GID00016087	Well, I, uh, not much, really. Vault 21 was my home, my dear home. I left it to explore the outside world.
GID00016088	At first it was a marvel to behold. My inspiration flowed true and its works caught Mr. House's 'attention. That's how I ended up in this... place.
GID00016089	That's great to hear, really great.
GID00016090	I always wanted to see the Dinosaur and its Thermometer sign at Novac. Then, there's the famous Bison Steve sign.
GID00016091	The McCarran Airfield and the Helios One power station signs are of much interest to my work - like the Sunset Sarsaparrilla Headquarter's bottle.
GID00016092	You have earned it, my friend! Now I can finally unveil my masterpieces to the world, all thanks to you. Come visit me again sometime.
GID00016093	What!? No, please! Here, take the caps but please don't hurt me!
GID00016094	Wayne, it's okay. The King sent 'em.
GID00016095	Whoa, hey now, kid, that's some kind of serious charge you're dropping. You want to be real careful what you say next.
GID00016096	Yeah? What else you got?
GID00016097	Really? You got something to say about the big boss, huh? Well, why don't you say it to his face instead of yapping at me?
GID00016098	I hear they got their act together out west - like a real old-time country, they tell me.
GID00016099	Now, maybe that's true and maybe it ain't, but Vegas is a whole new scene. Those bear-flag boys better step light, unless they want a knuckle supper.
GID00016100	The Tops? Yeah, sure, you want the nickel tour ol' Swank's happy to oblige.
GID00016101	We got everything you could want - slot machines in the back, cards and roulette in the front, fine entertainment upstairs in the Aces Theater.
GID00016102	And all with your security personally guaranteed by the Chairmen and Mr. House's own Securitron police. It's the Tops!
GID00016103	Sure, kid, sure. What can I tell you?
GID00016104	Joana? That bitch spreading lies about me? I've got a lesson to teach her about loose lips.
GID00016105	Business? What the fuck do you mean business? You looking to get yourself burned?
GID00016106	Now you start talking real clear, and I mean fucking crystal clear, because I'm about to lose my patience.
GID00016107	I banged Lot's wife and licked her salty ass. The fuck do I look like? I'm the one asking the questions here.
GID00016108	Now tell me why you been dropping my name before I get some muscle over here and we find a private place to talk.
GID00016109	I don't give half a dick what you've heard. Now get the fuck out of my face before I burn your sorry ass.
GID00016110	Where the fuck did you get that? Okay, listen buddy... That's some dangerous shit you got there.
GID00016111	That book could get me killed, if the wrong people see it. Let's talk, what do you want? What can I do for you?
GID00016112	Yeah. I hope you're looking to do some business with me. I think it could be mutually beneficial.
GID00016113	My hands are tied. I can't go against orders... can I?
GID00016114	You cut a deal with the Khans? Damn it. Attacking them now doesn't feel right, but orders are orders.
GID00016115	I don't like it, but orders are orders.
GID00016116	Have a look.
GID00016117	Things were better when the Omertas were buying, but we get by. Good selection from traders and the Van Graffs keep things running.
GID00016118	Things were better when the Omertas were buying, but we get by. Van Graffs getting killed is making a mess of things, but we have other customers.
GID00016119	That's the thing, I have no idea. They just stopped buying guns all of a sudden.
GID00016120	If you hear anything, let me know.
GID00016121	Anything else I can help you with?
GID00016122	Really? What did you learn?
GID00016123	Well, that would explain why they stopped buying. Them not telling me why leads me to think I'd rather not know the particulars.
GID00016124	Thanks for digging that up for me. If there is any way you could convince them to reestablish, I have a few extra special items you can have.
GID00016125	They're too pricey for anyone around here to afford, but getting the Omerta's sales back would be a worthy trade.
GID00016126	Outstanding! You have no idea how much this means to me, but I think this little beauty will give you an idea.
GID00016127	Take a gander.
GID00016128	I only offer services if The King gives the okay. Impress him and we can talk.
GID00016129	If you haven't heard of The King, you must have been living under a rock or something.
GID00016130	The King has his boys all over Freeside. He controls the water pump and is essentially the go-to guy for what goes around here.
GID00016131	Sure, kid, sure - I can spare a couple. What can I do for you?
GID00016132	Ouch! Come on, baby, don't be that way. You don't know what you're missing.
GID00016133	Very well. Keep me updated.
GID00016134	You've got a mouth on you, kid. If I weren't busy working for the Garrets, I might give you a few lessons in common courtesy. Get lost.
GID00016135	Caps up front. We don't do tabs here.
GID00016136	Since you're new, I'll lay out the rules for you. The prostitutes here aren't slaves. They decide who they service.
GID00016137	You best make a good first impression if you want what they have to offer.
GID00016138	Rooms are just a few caps a night. Your choice of company is extra, assuming anyone's taken a liking to you.
GID00016139	Rooms are just a few caps a night. Your choice of company is extra, assuming anyone's taken a liking to you.
GID00016140	Great. There are three people who need to be tracked down, a real mixed basket of fruits. Their names are Grecks, Santiago, and Lady Jane.
GID00016141	James tells me you already handled Santiago by getting him to work for us. We'll just garnish his wages.
GID00016142	Great. There are three people who need to be tracked down, a real mixed basket of fruits. Their names are Grecks, Santiago, and Lady Jane.
GID00016143	Just a few caps and it's yours.
GID00016144	You already own the corner room. You don't need to rent another.
GID00016145	You're already renting a room. Sorry, but you can only rent one room at a time.
GID00016146	Up the steps, last room on the left. If you leave the Wrangler, we'll assume you're checking out.
GID00016147	Caps up front. We don't do tabs here.
GID00016148	Alright. What can I get you, then?
GID00016149	I have some work I need handled. Back before we instituted the caps up front rule, we used to allow customers tabs.
GID00016150	Well, needless to say, a few customers snuck out without paying their bills. We need someone to collect. The job would pay a percentage.
GID00016151	Well, with Caleb McCaffery dead, it looks like we could use a new bounty hunter.
GID00016152	I have some work I need handled. Back before we instituted the caps up front rule, we used to allow customers tabs.
GID00016153	Well, needless to say, a few customers snuck out without paying their bills. We need someone to collect. The job would pay a percentage.
GID00016154	I'd prefer you not kill anyone with a debt. It's a bit difficult to collect on a corpse.
GID00016155	Just get the caps from them. After that, I couldn't care less what happens to those deadbeats.
GID00016156	If you bring all of their debts back, we'll give you a cut of each. 25% is more than fair. It would add up to 150 caps if you bring them all in.
GID00016157	Fair enough. Anything else you need? I'm a busy woman.
GID00016158	Great. There are three people who need to be tracked down, a real mixed basket of fruits. Their names are Grecks, Santiago, and Lady Jane.
GID00016159	James tells me you already handled Santiago by getting him to work for us. We'll just garnish his wages.
GID00016160	Great. There are three people who need to be tracked down, a real mixed basket of fruits. Their names are Grecks, Santiago, and Lady Jane.
GID00016161	[SUCCEEDED] Alright. 50/50 it is, but you better bring back all of the caps. If we hear you crossed us, the next bounty hunter will be coming for you.
GID00016162	[FAILED] Who the hell do you think you're talking to? Keep talking like that and your ass is going to be in the gutter. 25%. Take it or leave it.
GID00016163	Who's the King? You believe this asshole, man?
GID00016164	In Freeside, the Kings rule. And the King rules the Kings. Got it?
GID00016165	Anything's possible, I suppose. How much is it worth to you to meet the big man?
GID00016166	Whatever.
GID00016167	What, do I look like a beggar to you? Take a hike, cheapskate.
GID00016168	You know what? I think you and the King have some business to discuss.
GID00016169	Head on through. The King's the bored-looking guy by the stage. Can't fuckin' miss him.
GID00016170	Whoa. I mean, yeah, that should do. The King will see you now.
GID00016171	Head on through. He's the bored-looking guy by the stage. Can't fuckin' miss him.
GID00016172	Sounds about right.
GID00016173	That's Pace for you. He means well, but he doesn't like strangers. Here, to make amends.
GID00016174	Now, what can I do for you?
GID00016175	My boy, Ted. He was right here. I didn't leave him but a minute. I told him to stay put while I talked some things over with the White Glove folks.
GID00016176	He never was one to stay tied down to a spot, though. Gets that from his mother.
GID00016177	Got most of my staff out looking for him now. I'd be out myself, but I keep hoping he'll show up back here.
GID00016178	Course if he does that I'll whup him till his skinny hide turns to leather for putting me through this. But that don't mean I wouldn't be grateful.
GID00016179	Yep, got a whole mess of brahmins to my name. Bighorners, too.
GID00016180	Used to just have the one ranch, but land was easy to grab before the soldiers moved in.
GID00016181	Before I knew it I was running one of the biggest ranching operations east of California.
GID00016182	Now everywhere I go, folks I never even met shake my hand and call me "Mr. Gunderson." Don't know quite what to make of that.
GID00016183	That's what they call themselves, the folk that run this place. They're the ones dressed all fancy with their bowties and shiny dresses.
GID00016184	Some of 'em got masks, too. Real hard to trust folks like that. Couple of them show their faces and that's who I do my business with.
GID00016185	I don't talk to none of the other ones.
GID00016186	That's between me and the White Glove Society.
GID00016187	But let's just say they control the food supply around here, and I got lots of food to give, but that ain't as welcome as you might think.
GID00016188	What in Creation is the matter with you? Ain't you ever been a parent? Ain't you ever been worried you lost someone?
GID00016189	You got a real sick sense of humor.
GID00016190	You're dead right it's serious. I ain't seen my son in hours. Don't know where he went.
GID00016191	Folks round here, some of 'em would kill you soon as look at you. His whole life I tried to keep him at the ranch, away from places like this.
GID00016192	Now I take him here and what happens?
GID00016193	This again? I thought all this was settled. I answered every one of that investigator's questions to his satisfaction and gave all the help I could.
GID00016194	I know our reputation hasn't always been spotless, but that's all in the past now. How some people can't get over it is beyond me.
GID00016195	For the last time, the White Glove Society has never and will never consume human flesh for any reason. It's written in the charter.
GID00016196	Now didn't I already tell you that we don't do that sort of thing? We do not engage in cannibalism here under any circumstances.
GID00016197	Though we haven't always been the White Glove Society. There was another time, a dark time, when we went by a different name.
GID00016198	But that's all changed now! We've... evolved past such base impulses since settling into our new home. I've seen to it that those days are behind us.
GID00016199	There was an investigator who came through here last week. He'd been hired by a young man whose bride-to-be went missing during their stay here.
GID00016200	Well you can already guess what probably happened, can't you? It seems perfectly likely that she got cold feet and ran off.
GID00016201	And that young groom just didn't have a clue, the poor dear.
GID00016202	You disgust me. How dare you say such a filthy thing in my establishment? I ought to have you arrested.
GID00016203	You'll kindly mind your tongue, or we shan't speak any further.
GID00016204	You disgust me. How dare you say such a filthy thing in my establishment? I ought to have you arrested.
GID00016205	You'll kindly mind your tongue, or we shan't speak any further.
GID00016206	Why yes, I think so. If he hasn't checked out yet, that is.
GID00016207	I had our maitre d', Mortimer, offer him a complimentary room for as long as it took for him to be satisfied.
GID00016208	You see? The White Glove Society remains the very picture of courtesy, even in the face of such impolite accusations. We have nothing to hide here.
GID00016209	I do, but one can hardly call it work. I think of myself as a caretaker rather than a common laborer.
GID00016210	I suppose it is a labor of love if it can be called labor at all.
GID00016211	We at the White Glove Society are all responsible for maintaining the beauty and class of the Ultra-Luxe.
GID00016212	And as its founder I suppose it falls to me to decide how we go about it.
GID00016213	What else? Mr. Gunderson and I have been discussing his livestock.
GID00016214	It's put us in rather a delicate position, you see, his coming here. Not that we aren't grateful for his generous offer.
GID00016215	But our executive chef Philippe has transformed brahmin steak into a delicacy. He really is a genius. Everyone wants it.
GID00016216	But a delicacy is just that - delicate. If everyone can get it, it ceases to be a delicacy. It becomes a perfectly ordinary staple.
GID00016217	And if the Gourmand served staples, it would no longer draw the caliber of people it deserves. It'd be a diner or a... a family restaurant.
GID00016218	So as much as we'd all love for there to be enough steak for everyone, I'm afraid there are more important things to consider.
GID00016219	Private investigator... Ah, yes. I remember the gentleman.
GID00016220	This was about the missing bride. Such an awful thing. I do hope he finds her whereabouts.
GID00016221	If I might pry, have you found something that will help his investigation?
GID00016222	Of course, of course.
GID00016223	Ordinarily, we don't give out guest information, but I think given the circumstances, he'll want to speak with you.
GID00016224	Let's see... he hasn't checked out yet. If you head back to the hotel rooms, his will be one floor directly above you after you exit the lobby.
GID00016225	I hope we can put this whole matter to rest at last.
GID00016226	Good. I hope that young man gets some closure after all he's been through.
GID00016227	You are? Nothing so grim as his investigation, I hope.
GID00016228	Just the usual. Legion scouts try to slip across the river a couple times a week, but they always end up floating downriver with holes in their heads.
GID00016229	We've got liquor, chems, and whores a plenty. Pick your fix and we'll oblige. Our only rule is no sampling the merchandise. Caps paid in advance.
GID00016230	If you'd like to do a bit of gambling, we have an exchange at the back of the casino on the left.
GID00016231	Say goodbye to the hostage, fucker.
GID00016232	The NCR's coming for us! Waste the hostages!
GID00016233	Be quick and quiet, and don't get dead.
GID00016234	Do I look like a career counselor, kid? Get lost.
GID00016235	Rates of injury and illness in Freeside are very high. Supplies don't last long.
GID00016236	Med-X, Rad-Away, and Fixer are Freeside essentials. I can't pay you for any supplies you bring in, but I could discount the charge for our services.
GID00016237	Just come see me when you've got some supplies to turn in.
GID00016238	That's too bad. If you change your mind, let me know.
GID00016239	<Sighs> Ain't nobody got one darned piece of news about my boy? Not one lousy speck of information?
GID00016240	Ain't got one Brahmin unaccounted for across a dozen ranches, but I'm here for an hour and my own son just up and disappears on me.
GID00016241	What? Oh, my God! Where?
GID00016242	Wonderful. One thing up front - the moment you leave Freeside, our contract is done. That being said, please, after you.
GID00016243	Come back when you have the caps, then. If you'll excuse me, I have more important people to talk to in the meantime.
GID00016244	You've made the right choice. As long as you're in Freeside, I'm your man. No one will mess with you with me hanging around.
GID00016245	However, once you head over to the Strip or enter the wasteland, I'm heading immediately back here to pick up another customer.
GID00016246	So what do you say? Ready to head out?
GID00016247	Oh, for the love of - get the hell out of here, then!
GID00016248	You won't regret it, my friend! As long as you're in Freeside, I'll be right behind you, covering your back.
GID00016249	Oh, I should mention that I don't go where I'm not invited, so don't count on me following you inside private property. Ready to get going?
GID00016250	That is most regrettable, my friend. I wish you well in the meantime.
GID00016251	Need a bodyguard?
GID00016252	You got the caps, I got the guns!
GID00016253	These guys couldn't keep fleas off a dog. Hire me!
GID00016254	Protection services for hire over here!
GID00016255	Safe travel through Freeside!
GID00016256	You need the best. Hire me!
GID00016257	Your safety guaranteed!
GID00016258	Freeside's a dangerous place, my friend!
GID00016259	Only I can keep you safe, my friend!
GID00016260	It's your funeral. Come see me when you wise up.
GID00016261	Are you sure? Well, don't say you weren't warned.
GID00016262	I can't say I recommend that, but hopefully you'll change your mind. I'll be here if you do. Good luck!
GID00016263	You could go without one, but you'd be up to your waist in vermin either begging for your caps or demanding it at knifepoint the whole time.
GID00016264	I've got a reputation for shooting first and not really bothering to ask questions later. With me around, the vermin should keep their distance.
GID00016265	So what'll it be? I've already spotted two other potential customers while we've been chatting.
GID00016266	New to Freeside, are you? Trust me, you won't make it ten feet without being accosted by some of our more friendly residents.
GID00016267	I happen to have an understanding with most of the local wildlife, however. With me by your side, they'll kindly find someone else to bother.
GID00016268	So you want to run with the best or not?
GID00016269	Ah, my friend, believe me when I tell you that this place, while quite nice when you know your way around, can be very, very dangerous.
GID00016270	There are those who would hinder your every step with requests for your money, your business, or even your life.
GID00016271	With your permission, however, I would be happy to stand between you and those people. How does that sound?
GID00016272	I understand. Well, have a good day.
GID00016273	The first thing you should know is that Freeside is run by a pack of yahoos that call themselves the Kings.
GID00016274	Their leader, who oddly enough calls himself the King, currently has his hands full trying to prevent an all-out riot in Freeside.
GID00016275	That's two tips, but what the hell. You're a new customer so the extra one's on me. Wanna hear another?
GID00016276	Northwest of the big Freeside sign is a casino called the Atomic Wrangler.
GID00016277	It's not as fancy as the ones on the Strip, but there's still plenty of excitement to be found there.
GID00016278	At the northwest end of Fremont Street you'll find the Silver Rush. It's run by a rather scary family called the Van Graffs.
GID00016279	Trust me, these are not people you want to mess with. But if lasers and such are your thing, the goods they sell are second to none.
GID00016280	People in Freeside generally fall into one of two categories. Those who've been here all their lives call themselves Locals.
GID00016281	When people from the NCR and other places started pouring in, the Locals began referring to them as Squatters, and the name stuck.
GID00016282	The Locals blame the Squatters for the scarcity of resources in Freeside, and the Squatters blame any act of violence against them on the Locals.
GID00016283	They're both right to some extent, and violent outbreaks between the two are all too common these days.
GID00016284	If you've been around the Kings, you may have met one of them named Pacer. He's always stomping around trying show off his authority.
GID00016285	Being new, you weren't around when it happened, but a few months ago Pacer pissed off the Van Graff family big time.
GID00016286	No one knows what went down, but word is the Van Graffs still want him dead.
GID00016287	Drugs are everywhere in Freeside, and even people you might not expect have become addicts.
GID00016288	Jacob Hoff, for instance. That man was a brilliant chemist before he picked up the habit. Now, just another junkie.
GID00016289	That King Pacer's a fan of Jet, too, though I heard one of the Followers talking about it being dangerous for him. Something about his heart.
GID00016290	Do yourself a favor, and stay away from that stuff, okay?
GID00016291	In the area between the north and east gates is the Old Mormon Fort, where the Followers of the Apocalypse have set themselves up.
GID00016292	The Followers aren't a bad bunch, and provide healing and supplies to the people of Freeside as they can.
GID00016293	I've heard the Garrets over at the Atomic Wrangler are having a hard time collecting some money owed to them.
GID00016294	An enterprising person like yourself might be able to make some caps helping them with their little problem.
GID00016295	Caught a rumor the other day that some of the clientele over at the Wrangler have been making some rather strange requests.
GID00016296	Stuff like weirdos wanting the, ahem, services of ghouls and such. I almost have half a mind to volunteer myself, sexy beast that I am.
GID00016297	Have you tried going to the Strip, only to be stopped by those big metal murder machines? Happens every day around here.
GID00016298	But if you know the right people, you can get through the gate without being a rich man.
GID00016299	I probably don't have to tell you that Freeside's dangerous, but you might want to think twice about hiring one of those guards at the gates.
GID00016300	They're not all saints, is all I'm saying.
GID00016301	Have you been to Mick & Ralph's yet? They run a store just down the street, and sell some things you might not expect.
GID00016302	There's a guy out on the main drag who sells second hand adventuring gear. He's got an okay selection, but where does it come from?
GID00016303	He might not look it, but Ralph from Mick & Ralph's is no slouch with a keyboard. I've heard he's helped reprogram several robots in his time.
GID00016304	Saw a strange thing the other day. The King took that robo-dog of his over to the Old Mormon Fort.
GID00016305	Weird thing was that the dog was flipping out, and had to be restrained by a few of the King's men. Hope he doesn't get loose.
GID00016306	Things have generally been bad here for the Squatters, the people who came here hoping for a better life and just got stuck.
GID00016307	But lately the mood has changed. The Squatters seem to be a bit more optimistic. I wonder what happened?
GID00016308	Mention the NCR and people around here get a little on edge. There's talk that they're going to take over all of New Vegas.
GID00016309	It doesn't help that they've got military camps all over the place, and more troops pour into the area daily.
GID00016310	There's a rumor that a huge army is camped to the east, massing to attack the NCR. Like that'd ever happen.
GID00016311	Who in the world could stand up to the NCR and win?
GID00016312	While everyone knows Mr. House runs New Vegas, no one knows the first thing about him.
GID00016313	He just sort of showed up a few years back, and everything you see around you is the result. Just who in the hell is he?
GID00016314	The Strip is run by the Three Families, who owe their allegiance to Mr. House.
GID00016315	When he first showed up, he gave the local tribes the choice of working with him or getting the hell out of his way.
GID00016316	Given how things turned out, I know which way I'd have gone, but hindsight's twenty-twenty, right?
GID00016317	The Omertas, one of Mr. House's Three Families, run a casino called Gomorrah on the Strip.
GID00016318	If you thought the Wrangler was something, you owe it to yourself to go there.
GID00016319	The Chairmen run a casino on the Strip called the Tops. It's a pretty classy place, by all reports.
GID00016320	I haven't been there myself, but I hear security there is kinda tight. Don't expect to bring your weapons in there.
GID00016321	There was a rumor a while back that the White Glove Society was really an all-ghoul gang, which is why they wear those weird masks of theirs.
GID00016322	What do you think, would I look good in a mask? Maybe I'd make more caps...
GID00016323	A traveler that passed through here not long ago told everyone he met that there's some kind of plant paradise to the west where food is abundant.
GID00016324	All the people foolish enough to listen to him and head out that way never came back.
GID00016325	Ever hear of the Gun Runners? They sell just about every kind of firearm you can imagine, and some you probably couldn't.
GID00016326	I've heard people passing through mention some kind of underground fights pitting creatures of the waste against one another for sport.
GID00016327	And when I say "underground," that's their word I'm using, not my own.
GID00016328	East of Freeside there's an old air force base, judging by the road signs.
GID00016329	No one knows for sure what's in there, though, on account of anyone approaching the place getting violently blown up.
GID00016330	I heard something about a town south of here being attacked, but details are sketchy. All I know is there haven't been any refugees showing up here.
GID00016331	Which means either the attack wasn't too bad, or it was very, very bad.
GID00016332	Traders have been griping for a while now about the 15 being too dangerous to travel. I'd steer clear of it unless you're armed to the teeth.
GID00016333	The NCR used to run a prison to the southwest, but something happened a little while back, and now all you'll get is hard looks if you ask about it.
GID00016334	Ha ha ha, oh that's rich. You're not exactly my type, no offense. No, I meant I could give you a tip. Earn my money, so to speak.
GID00016335	You look like you're new around here, so I'm sure I know all sorts of things you'd find useful. If not, well, it's only a cap.
GID00016336	So what do you say?
GID00016337	Oh. Well, you'd better not let any of the real troopers hear that - and, of course, they won't be hearing it from me, neither.
GID00016338	So, what brings you to Boulder City? Not many people come here.
GID00016339	The workers here don't much like the military. After too many fights and broken noses, the NCR doesn't allow troops to spend time here.
GID00016340	That doesn't stop a few people like yourself, of course. Don't worry, I won't say a word.
GID00016341	I've been trying to get someone to authorize this update - or at the least get field clearance to leave the camp and do this myself.
GID00016342	But nobody takes me seriously - they just think I'm an incompetent desk jockey trying to glamorize the importance of my job.
GID00016343	Less than a third of reported enemy sightings are getting intercepted. Either our intel is faulty, or our enemies are one step ahead of us.
GID00016344	I see... well, if you change your mind and want to earn some caps, let me know.
GID00016345	Yep, I'd say you're getting a little trigger happy there. Try to slow down a bit. Concentrate on hitting your target.
GID00016346	Here. Go easy on it, now. Ammo can be hard to come by out here.
GID00016347	Well let's just finish this first, all right? Then we can talk. Preferably somewhere where I can get a stiff drink and Cheyenne can keep cool.
GID00016348	Well let's just finish this first, all right? Then we can talk.
GID00016349	Fire away.
GID00016350	Help!
GID00016351	There's too many!
GID00016352	Get 'em off!
GID00016353	Once the Great Khans have been killed or captured, you're welcome to retrieve any property they've taken from you.
GID00016354	I ain't got much, but it'll do you more good out there than it will in here. Take what I got.
GID00016355	Seems like wherever I go it's always the same. Folks just never leave each other alone.
GID00016356	I'm not much good in a fight, with my bum leg. And my supplies are scarce. But I'll give you what I can spare.
GID00016357	They were having some kind of argument about it, but the guy in the checkered coat kept shushing them.
GID00016358	Sounded like they came in from the north through Quarry Junction. If that's the case I can't say I blame them for not wanting to go back.
GID00016359	That whole area's overrun with the kind of critters that just get mad if you shoot 'em.
GID00016360	Merchants avoid that whole stretch of I-15 like it's radioactive. Which it could be for all I know.
GID00016361	I didn't hear exactly, but the leader was talking about the Strip.
GID00016362	Fella wants to get there and avoid the 15, he'd have to go east. Take Highway 93 up.
GID00016363	Chain gangs, really. The NCR brought them in from California to work on the rail lines.
GID00016364	Problem is, it turns out that giving convicts a bunch of dynamite and blasting powder isn't the best idea.
GID00016365	Was a big escape not too long ago. Some of 'em stuck together so they could make trouble. That's what we're dealing with now.
GID00016366	Now just hold on! I meant it when I said I'd help you. I guess I must've dozed off. That's never happened before.
GID00016367	Really? I must've dozed off. Although, that's never happened before.
GID00016368	Didn't hear a thing. I guess I dozed off there for a minute.
GID00016369	Override? That can't be right. Probably just a malfunctioning tube somewhere.
GID00016370	I truly am sorry I couldn't help you, pardner. Was there something else you wanted to talk about?
GID00016371	Never heard of it.
GID00016372	I truly am sorry I couldn't help you, pardner. Was there something else you wanted to talk about?
GID00016373	That's a puzzle, all right. I'm sure it's nothing.
GID00016374	I truly am sorry I couldn't help you, pardner. Was there something else you wanted to talk about?
GID00016375	This'll make you feel better.
GID00016376	Those howitzers of ours aren't just for entertainment, child! Explosive ordnance is what keeps the savages at a distance.
GID00016377	Except you! There's something special about you, child, and it was the howitzers that gave you a chance to show it!
GID00016378	Prophecy? Do we look like a bunch of religious idiots?
GID00016379	I just hoped a savage - outsider, sorry - would make it to our gates before one of those armies out there comes knocking.
GID00016380	That's right, child. Mother Pearl knows a storm is gathering. Times are changing. May be time for us to change a little, too.
GID00016381	As I said, she is our Eldest. Mother Pearl has lived at Nellis from the start, and has the wisdom of her age.
GID00016382	She said this day would come, and that any savage to reach our gates should be brought to her.
GID00016383	Unacceptable. You've made it this far, probed our defenses, seen our faces.
GID00016384	Mother Pearl's invitation is mandatory, not optional.
GID00016385	I told you, Mother Pearl's invitation is not optional.
GID00016386	Confiscate your weapons? Certainly not! Personal armament is the foundation of social trust and responsibility.
GID00016387	No time for strangers, huh? I should probably follow your example. That's the last time I pick up a straggler on the road, believe me.
GID00016388	Excellent treatment. I hadn't thought of that!
GID00016389	I thought that man was done for, but you brought him around.
GID00016390	That was some fine doctoring. I could learn a thing or two from you!
GID00016391	Ol' Festus is still holding. You go again, pardner.
GID00016392	Ol' Festus thinks he's got this won. I'm holding.
GID00016393	Ol' Festus is gonna draw.
GID00016394	Looks like I got an ace, pardner.
GID00016395	Looks like I got a two, pardner.
GID00016396	Looks like I got a three, pardner.
GID00016397	Looks like I got a four, pardner.
GID00016398	Looks like I got a five, pardner.
GID00016399	Looks like I got a six, pardner.
GID00016400	Looks like I got a seven, pardner.
GID00016401	Looks like I got a eight, pardner.
GID00016402	Looks like I got a nine, pardner.
GID00016403	Looks like I got a ten, pardner.
GID00016404	Your turn, pardner. Draw, hold, or quit?
GID00016405	Looks like I win, pardner. You did well, but ol' Festus did a bit better, hee hee.
GID00016406	If you'd like to play again, say "Play again". If you've had enough of ol' Festus' boots stompin all over ya, say "I'm done".
GID00016407	Lucky horseshoes! I just nudged your total up one, pardner. No hard feelings, right?
GID00016408	You're holding, so ol' Festus'll just go again.
GID00016409	Drat, ol' Festus needs more than that to catch you.
GID00016410	Tarnation, ol' Festus's seen three-legged cattle move faster than this hand!
GID00016411	Let's see, you're at 21, so ol' Festus knows you want to hit. Just kidding, heh heh.
GID00016412	See that? Ol' Festus is an old hand at this.
GID00016413	Are you still there, pardner? Ol' Festus can hardly see you, you're so far behind!
GID00016414	Twenty-one! Just where ol' Festus wants to be. Beat that, pardner!
GID00016415	You're doing well, but ol' Festus isn't out of this yet.
GID00016416	Ol' Festus must be getting old. You're leaving me in the dust.
GID00016417	Well, I'll be. That makes twenty-one for you, pardner.
GID00016418	You'll have to toss better than that, pardner!
GID00016419	Ol' Festus doesn't like your chances, pardner.
GID00016420	Ol' Festus is fine staying at twenty-one.
GID00016421	Looks like you got an ace, pardner.
GID00016422	Looks like you got a two, pardner.
GID00016423	Looks like you got a three, pardner.
GID00016424	Looks like you got a four, pardner.
GID00016425	Looks like you got a five, pardner.
GID00016426	Looks like you got a six, pardner.
GID00016427	Looks like you got a seven, pardner.
GID00016428	Looks like you got a eight, pardner.
GID00016429	Looks like you got a nine, pardner.
GID00016430	Looks like you got a ten, pardner.
GID00016431	Looks like you win, pardner. Ol' Festus just couldn't match those keen skills of yours. Here's your reward.
GID00016432	If you'd like to play again, say "Play again". If you're done humiliating poor ol' Festus at his own game, say "I'm done".
GID00016433	Lucky horseshoes! You just nudged ol' Festus' total up one. Don't worry, I won't hold it against you, heh heh.
GID00016434	If you hold now, pardner, I'll win! Let's pretend you drew, shall we?
GID00016435	I'd hold on 21 too, heh heh. Looks like ol' Festus needs a miracle now, eh?
GID00016436	Okay, pardner. Guess it's up to me to catch up.
GID00016437	Sure. The elder's already given the okay. Unfortunately, you'll have to use your own weapons and ammo.
GID00016438	Oh man, I told Watkins this wasn't going to work.
GID00016439	Look, Watkins and I snuck out one day. She said it'd be a training exercise.
GID00016440	Said she heard from a guy on one of the patrols that there was a gulch just southeast of here with scorpions in it, and that we had to check it out.
GID00016441	There were scorpions out there, all right. We started using them for target practice, but before we knew it the damn things were all around us.
GID00016442	So we made a run for it, and in all the commotion, I dropped my pistol. Watkins keeps urging me to go back and get it, but that's not gonna happen.
GID00016443	You can go outside, though, can't you? You could return the pistol to Torres and clear this whole thing up for me.
GID00016444	Oh thank god. Hardin was about to start an inquiry into the whole affair, and more than a few heads would have rolled as a result.
GID00016445	Since you helped me, I'll tell you what. I work on some of our busted weapons in my spare time, so I have a few pieces that are kept off the books.
GID00016446	Here, take this. I hope it comes in handy.
GID00016447	Then we have nothing further to talk about.
GID00016448	Follow me. It's just down to the southeast a short ways.
GID00016449	Suit yourself. Hope this helped you some.
GID00016450	Shouldn't take more than a couple minutes. Especially with two of us.
GID00016451	Come with me.
GID00016452	I don't blame you. They're good eating, but that's about it.
GID00016453	Now, see those sarsaparilla bottles on that fence there? Take this and try to hit a couple of 'em.
GID00016454	Okay, you're on. Go give 'em hell.
GID00016455	That's the right idea. Look down the sight.
GID00016456	Try crouching down and staying still. It'll help your aim.
GID00016457	Nice shot.
GID00016458	I did have what was left of the Crimson Caravan money, but I wasn't sure if it was my right to just give it away.
GID00016459	I owe you more than that, though, so look me up at the Crimson Caravan camp up in New Vegas if you ever visit.
GID00016460	[FAILED] Look, I don't know you, so what I'm doing here isn't any of your business.
GID00016461	[SUCCEEDED] That is a pretty flimsy story, I guess. The real reason that I'm staying is because there's a group of men out to kill me.
GID00016462	You're welcome. So, can I get you anything?
GID00016463	Other than rolling around once in awhile, it doesn't do anything useful as far as I can tell.
GID00016464	I don't know why it took an interest in you, but I'd be careful. It's never helped anyone before.
GID00016465	It acts friendly enough, but I don't trust that whole "cheerful cowboy" act. I find it all very creepy.
GID00016466	Fine by me.
GID00016467	All right.
GID00016468	It was here when I took over the saloon seven years ago. Some people have said its owner lived here, but no one knows who it was.
GID00016469	I'm a Securitron, RobCo security model 2060-B. If you ever see any of my brothers, tell them Victor says howdy.
GID00016470	An impressive piece of work. I'll keep that in mind if jobs come up in the future.

GID00016483	I doubt it. Poindexter might have an idea for some kind of last-minute scheme. You should talk to him.
GID00016484	Yeah, right. Bitch.
GID00016485	Yeah, right. Dick.
GID00016486	Oh, okay. Just thought I'd ask.
GID00016487	Classified? Shit, it must be really big then.
GID00016488	Are you serious? No way! I don't believe it!
GID00016489	Some folks just ain't cut out for Army life, I guess.
GID00016490	Oh, don't worry! I won't!
GID00016491	Well that don't make no sense. We came all this way; why don't he want to stay? It's nice here.
GID00016492	[SUCCEEDED] Of course. You been through a lot. Ain't much, but these'll do you right if the pain flares up.
GID00016493	[SUCCEEDED] Of course. You been through a lot. Ain't much, but these'll do you right if the pain flares up.
GID00016494	[SUCCEEDED] Of course. You been through a lot. Ain't much, but these'll do you right if the pain flares up.
GID00016495	[FAILED] Sorry. I'm afraid I'm all out of lollipops.
GID00016496	Well, I already told you I came from a vault. After that, was a traveling doctor for a spell.
GID00016497	Seemed like a good idea at the time. Most folks out here ain't educated, so people with medical knowhow are hard to come by.
GID00016498	Found that I could help a lot of people with what I knew, and that was all right with me.
GID00016499	Eventually, I went back and married my childhood sweetheart and that was the end of my traveling days. Didn't miss it none then. Still don't.
GID00016500	Well, there's a general store just up the road. Run by a fella named Chet. He don't got nothing fancy, but he's got your basics covered.
GID00016501	If you're looking to wet your whistle, just past Chet's is the Prospector Saloon. The bartender there, Trudy, knows everyone in town.
GID00016502	Other than that, there's not much to see. Just people trying to scratch out a living.
GID00016503	Well, there's a general store just up the road. Run by a fella named Chet. He don't got nothing fancy, but he's got your basics covered.
GID00016504	If you're looking to wet your whistle, just past Chet's is the Prospector Saloon. The bartender there, Trudy, knows everyone in town.
GID00016505	Other than that, there's not much to see. Just people trying to scratch out a living.
GID00016506	This here's Goodsprings. Named after the water we got here, just down the road to the southeast. Goodsprings Source, they call it.
GID00016507	It's a quiet town, and that's how we like it. We don't go looking for trouble, though occasionally it sees fit to come looking for us.
GID00016508	That'd be Victor. Curious fella. Sort of odd. And I don't just mean 'cause he's a robot. I couldn't tell you much about him.
GID00016509	He's real friendly, don't get me wrong. You just get the sense that ain't the whole picture. Just a feeling.
GID00016510	Keeps to himself, mostly. You want to know more about him, you'll have to ask him yourself. He has a shack on the southern edge of town.
GID00016511	I didn't see him or the men with him. You might ask around town, though. Could be someone saw which way they was headed.
GID00016512	Your best bet would probably be Trudy, the bartender at the saloon up the road. If anyone saw anything, she'd know about it.
GID00016513	Yeah.
GID00016514	It's all I've got with me, but if you look me up at the Crimson Caravan's main camp in New Vegas, I'll pay you in full.
GID00016515	I've never stopped here until recently. You're better off asking one of the locals.
GID00016516	It's been in business for a very long time, and is probably the biggest trading outfit in California.
GID00016517	There's a branch up in New Vegas, but it hasn't been doing so well. Word is that the big boss herself, Alice McLafferty, is coming in to fix things.
GID00016518	Happy trails!
GID00016519	I was out for a stroll that night when I heard the commotion up at the old bone orchard. Saw what looked like a bunch of bad eggs so I laid low.
GID00016520	Once they'd run off, I dug you up to see if you were still kicking. Turns out, you were, so I hauled you off to the Doc right quick.
GID00016521	Can't say that I'm familiar with the rascals. Some of the fine folks in town might be able to help you out with that.
GID00016522	I moseyed into town, oh, ten, fifteen years ago? Before that, I... hmmm, I can't quite seem to recall. Odd.
GID00016523	Anyway, it's a right peaceful town and I reckon it's as fine a place to settle as any.
GID00016524	I can patch you up in exchange for doses of Fixer.
GID00016525	I can patch you up in exchange for doses of Fixer.
GID00016526	I can unburden you of that in exchange for doses of Rad-Away.
GID00016527	I can unburden you of that in exchange for doses of Rad-Away.
GID00016528	I can help you in exchange for Stimpaks.
GID00016529	I can help you in exchange for Stimpaks.
GID00016530	You're going to feel a little pinch.
GID00016531	Fair enough.
GID00016532	Hold still. This'll burn for a moment.
GID00016533	The symptoms of withdrawal will pass with time.
GID00016534	This'll make you feel better.
GID00016535	Well, try to avoid further exposure.
GID00016536	Well, I know the secret to get past. If you give me the caps, I'll tell you.
GID00016537	If you make it back alive I'll double your money!
GID00016538	Okay, here you go. That page has the details, but it's all in the timing as you move from building to building.
GID00016539	I'll be here watching, so I'll know if you've made it to the gate or not. Remember, there's 600 caps in it if you make it.
GID00016540	[SUCCEEDED] Alright, I suppose I can cut you a deal, but not a cap lower. I gotta make a living here.
GID00016541	Okay, here you go. That page has the details, but it's all in the timing as you move from building to building.
GID00016542	I'll be here watching, so I'll know if you've made it to the gate or not. Remember, I'll pay double your wager if you make it back.
GID00016543	[FAILED] No deal. My info, my price.
GID00016544	[SUCCEEDED] Whoa, simmer down. I'll tell you. I'm a gambler and a scavenger.
GID00016545	I've made some cash from gambling, and some cash from... reclaiming goods that are no longer being used. Now do you want my help or not?
GID00016546	[FAILED] Who am I and what I am doing is my business. Now are you in the market for info or not?
GID00016547	Yep, here are your caps.
GID00016548	Sorry about that, poor memory. Here you go.
GID00016549	Sorry about that, poor memory. Here you go.
GID00016550	[SUCCEEDED] You drive a hard bargain. Here you go. Have a nice day.
GID00016551	[FAILED] No deal, here's what we agreed upon.
GID00016552	[FAILED] No deal, here's what we agreed upon.
GID00016553	Aren't you forgetting... nevermind. Goodbye.
GID00016554	Okay, well let me know when you do.
GID00016555	Thanks, this will just take a few moments...
GID00016556	Okay, it looks like the valve from the cooker was a perfect fit. Here is the rebreather.
GID00016557	[SUCCEEDED] That's a brilliant idea! I can put that together right now...
GID00016558	Here you go, a new rebreather!
GID00016559	[FAILED] Sorry, there is no way it would withstand submersion. Has to be watertight. Past few times I've tested it I've gotten a mouthful of water.
GID00016560	A pressure cooker would have the gaskets and valving I need to seal it up.
GID00016561	Okay.
GID00016562	Bye.
GID00016563	I guess you'll have to use hit and run tactics, and go see Doc Argyll if you need patching up. Good luck.
GID00016564	Well, how about that! I'll have to check out your handywork.
GID00016565	And here I thought we had them running as best we could before they broke down again. Thanks for getting those sorted for me.
GID00016566	Well, how about that! Turns out you aren't completely useless, working with your hands.
GID00016567	You want to hear it again? Of course! I did a good job the first time, huh?
GID00016568	Goodbye.
GID00016569	Excellent. Imagine - you're the first outsider ever to hear our tale! <clears throat>
GID00016570	If you're interested in knowing more about us, it seems like you'd be pretty amazed by the mural. Is there something else?
GID00016571	Several atomic warheads detonated here hundreds of years ago, leaving the base highly radioactive.
GID00016572	The savages of the wastes, ignoramuses, all avoided Nellis by habit.
GID00016573	Nellis is a completely self-sufficient community! We draw water from Lake Mead, solar arrays provide power, and we grow our own crops!
GID00016574	So you know about the vaults! Yes, we lived in one of those. Ours was numbered 34.
GID00016575	In our vault, everyone had guns - but the overseer wouldn't let you fire off any of the really fun ones.
GID00016576	I guess all the little pops and bangs at the firing ranges just got boring after a while!
GID00016577	You're right, they weren't here when we discovered Nellis! We found the guns at a huge weapon depot called Area 2, many miles from here!
GID00016578	It took many weeks to drag the guns and their ammunition back to Nellis - and it was the last time any of us set foot beyond our homeland!
GID00016579	Once we restored power, we learned that some elaborate chairs we'd been sleeping in were actually virtual reality simulators.
GID00016580	We believe they were used to train combat pilots. We use them extensively. I alone have shot down over 500 Chinese Xian-85 fighters!
GID00016581	Before you ask, I'm afraid there's no way you can be allowed to use the simulators. They are for our use only. Sorry.
GID00016582	Loyal found a file somewhere on the base, with magazine articles, photographs, a map, even.
GID00016583	It seems that a bomber, apparently the 29th of its kind, crashed in Lake Mead on July 21st, 1948. Just imagine - that's over 300 years ago!
GID00016584	The photographs showed that it was basically intact, and the map tells us exactly where to find it. Except we haven't left Nellis in decades.
GID00016585	All right. Is there something else you'd like to talk about?
GID00016586	Gosh, there's a lot of folks. Argyll's our doctor - he could use help tending to any injured we got.
GID00016587	Over at the workshop, Loyal and Jack are always building something - though Loyal may not be too happy to see your kind running around Nellis.
GID00016588	Raquel's our Master-At-Arms. I'm sure you've met her. There was a problem with some giant ants a while ago. She might want you to look into it.
GID00016589	And at Nellis, we found it. We haven't detonated any atomic warheads since before I was born, but otherwise it's do as you will!
GID00016590	[SUCCEEDED] Exactly! We haven't detonated any atomic warheads since before I was born, but besides that, to heck with nitpicky restrictions!
GID00016591	[FAILED] Um, that's nice, but it's not really the scale of explosion that interests us...
GID00016592	Keep that opinion to yourself when visiting Nellis, outsider. It makes you sound ignorant.
GID00016593	That's right! Our Geiger counter indicated that the base was radioactive, but not dangerously so. Enough time has passed.
GID00016594	[SUCCEEDED] That's exactly right! You're very knowledgeable for a sav - an outsider!
GID00016595	[FAILED] Uh... no. We'd just brought devices called Geiger counters with us from the vault, that's all. The radiation levels were safe.
GID00016596	For your information, our people had brought Geiger counters with them from the vault. The radiation levels here were within safe limits.
GID00016597	Also for your information, Nellis is not a scrapheap! We repaired most of the damage here long ago. Nellis is comfy!
GID00016598	Thank you. Our self-sufficiency is a point of pride.
GID00016599	[SUCCEEDED] Indeed we do! Very impressive.
GID00016600	[FAILED] We are certainly not cannibals! We're not savages, like some people!
GID00016601	We supplement grains and green vegetables with soy and legumes - that's how we get our protein!
GID00016602	Our nutrition is not deficient! We supplement our diet of grains and vegetables with soy and legumes for protein.
GID00016603	Yes, there's just about nothing we won't do to get our hands on some explosive ordnance!
GID00016604	[SUCCEEDED] Thank you so much! I'll be sure to pass that on.
GID00016605	[FAILED] I think it would be an exaggeration to imply that our interest in explosive ordnance is at odds with our integrity...
GID00016606	There's nothing wrong with our interest in explosive ordnance. It's kept the savages out. Until today, at least.
GID00016607	Thank you for being so understanding.
GID00016608	[SUCCEEDED] That's beautiful! Yes, it's exactly like that, so free, so... words can't do it justice.
GID00016609	[FAILED] Your attempt at poetry, is... uh, beautiful, certainly. But it doesn't really work like that. Flying, I mean.
GID00016610	I can see how you think that, since you don't know what you're talking about.
GID00016611	It'll be spectacular, won't it? You should talk to Loyal. I bet you could help.
GID00016612	[SUCCEEDED] Yes! In fact, that's exactly what Loyal has planned to do. You should go talk to him!
GID00016613	[FAILED] I'm not a mechanic, but after 300 years I don't think those engines would just start up.
GID00016614	As I said, repairing and flying the bomber is our destiny. It's that simple.
GID00016615	Ages ago, long before I was born, we lived underground. Everyone had guns but the overseer wouldn't let us explode anything, not even a hand grenade.
GID00016616	We left and wandered the wastes. There were savages with knives. We blew them up with frag mines and grenades, burned them with flamethrowers.
GID00016617	It was neat, but there was a downside. For every 43.6 savages we killed, we lost one of our own. We needed a new home. We needed Nellis.
GID00016618	Nellis, glittering like shrapnel in the desert sun. Nellis, bursting with missiles, warheads, and bombs. Nellis had waited. Just for us.
GID00016619	Here, we have prospered and multiplied. Here, our mighty guns destroy any savages who might try to harm us before they can even reach our gates!
GID00016620	Well, until... but... not saying you want to harm us or you're a savage, but... anyways.
GID00016621	Nellis has revealed many secrets. It has taught us how to fly the bombers once based here. And it has taught us where to find one!
GID00016622	And that is our story so far, for this last image is our future.
GID00016623	To restore the bomber, to fly the open skies in armored safety, raining high-explosive ordnance upon ignorant savages - this is our destiny!
GID00016624	I'm pleased that you listened to the entire story! Perhaps there are details you'd like to know more about? Let me know.
GID00016625	Got yourself cut up pretty good, eh?
GID00016626	Next time don't wait so long before you seek medical attention.
GID00016627	It's a good thing you made it in when you did.
GID00016628	You need to be more careful, you can really get hurt out there.
GID00016629	After the help you gave us with the shooting range, we'll take any advice you've got. I'll line them up.
GID00016630	Okay, if you say so. Hell, it's not like we've got a lot to lose here.
GID00016631	[FAILED] I've got a bad feeling about this....
GID00016632	[SUCCEEDED] Right. Easy enough. One... two... three!
GID00016633	[SUCCEEDED] Solid arc, check. Lob 'em up and over, people!
GID00016634	[FAILED] They're kind of heavy for that, but whatever you say....
GID00016635	[SUCCEEDED] Hold the grenades for groups, squad! Hit them in clusters and send them running!
GID00016636	[FAILED] What the... what the hell are you talking about?
GID00016637	Yeah, I do. Thanks. I think we might survive this now.
GID00016638	You've got a funny definition of "well," you know that? Whatever. Thanks for... whatever that was.
GID00016639	While you're doing that, I'll be here waiting for my friends. Join up with us once you're done.
GID00016640	Fuck you, then.
GID00016641	There are too many places to hide around here. He'd see me coming and then "bam", I'm dead.
GID00016642	He doesn't know you, though. He probably won't shoot right away.
GID00016643	You're going to feel a little pinch.
GID00016644	Hold still. This'll burn for a moment.
GID00016645	How many?
GID00016646	The next time you leave Nellis, keep an eye out for missiles. We're down to a five-year supply for our launchers.
GID00016647	Right.
GID00016648	Come find me when you've got some to turn in.
GID00016649	Fine.
GID00016650	It's better than nothing.
GID00016651	Thanks. Those'll last us a day.
GID00016652	Good work.
GID00016653	What kind of fool doesn't keep track of reserve ammunition? Don't waste my time.
GID00016654	And to this day, you can get a Sunset Sarsaparilla and enjoy the refreshing taste of that very same drink.
GID00016655	And sometimes, you can even find a blue star under the cap, just like that man did so many years ago.
GID00016656	And that's the Legend of the Star. Hope you enjoyed it, and hope you continue enjoying Sunset Sarsaparilla!
GID00016657	I see my services are required once more. It's about time.
GID00016658	Oh my. This place is filthy.
GID00016659	It's amazing how much dust collects if you leave things alone even for a short while.
GID00016660	Really, someone should have called me earlier.
GID00016661	This room is even worse than the last one.
GID00016662	What have you savages been doing here?
GID00016663	Ah, a job well done is it's own reward. Good riddance to this rubbish.
GID00016664	[SUCCEEDED] You heard the man, people, get focused!
GID00016665	[SUCCEEDED] You heard the lady, people, get focused!
GID00016666	[FAILED] Okay... sure. Everybody shoot the hell out of the target!
GID00016667	[SUCCEEDED] I've got the one at 11 o'clock! Razz, O'Hanrahan, take the two on the right! Poindexter, the center!
GID00016668	[FAILED] Faster, people, faster! More lead in the air!
GID00016669	[SUCCEEDED] Right. Exhale... squeeze. Focus on the shot.
GID00016670	[FAILED] I'm really not sure that's how this works.
GID00016671	Thanks for the help. I think the whole unit's doing a lot better now.
GID00016672	That was... something. Thanks for trying, at any rate.
GID00016673	The New California Republic. Bunch of settlers and soldiers coming in from the West, fixing on making Nevada their own.
GID00016674	They can be right pushy, but the roads are safer 'cause of them, so I tend to let it go.
GID00016675	Not that I got a choice.
GID00016676	Looting the bodies isn't a priority to me, but you go right on ahead.
GID00016677	You're right, we did. I just wish things had turned out better.
GID00016678	Help! You there, please help me!
GID00016679	He's crazy! Please help me!
GID00016680	Some what? Never mind, I'm going to take a few moments to compose myself, then head out. Thank you again.
GID00016681	No reason it should, I suppose. I need to be going. Thank you again.
GID00016682	Er, no, I don't think so. Caps are caps, right?
GID00016683	Look, I think I need a few moments to compose myself, then head out. Once again, thanks.
GID00016684	Sucker.
GID00016685	That's more like it. The people can pick up their extra ammo and leather armor when they're ready. Was there anything else?
GID00016686	All right, I'm ready. I hope.
GID00016687	All right. I'll just wait here until you come get me.
GID00016688	All I've got left on me are a handful of caps, but you get me out of this, and I'll make sure the Crimson Caravan pays you back. You've got my word.
GID00016689	I won't let you stick your neck out for free. I can't pay you back now, but I'll make sure the Crimson Caravan pays up. You've got my word.
GID00016690	All right. Was there anything else you wanted to talk to me about?
GID00016691	I'll stick around for a bit longer, but I'll be gone in a few days. If you ever visit New Vegas, look me up at the Crimson Caravan camp.
GID00016692	At least six, Joe Cobb included. They look pretty mean.
GID00016693	At least six. They look pretty mean.
GID00016694	They're getting set up in cover, but it might not go well unless we get out there soon.
GID00016695	Oh, Easy Pete came through with the dynamite. Here's your supply. I really hope I don't blow myself up.
GID00016696	I'll be set up near the store. Let's hope that the gang doesn't manage to make it that far.
GID00016697	At least his death was quick. Cobb's gang had much worse in mind for him.
GID00016698	Okay, see ya!
GID00016699	This is spiffy! Thanks!
GID00016700	No way! Pearl said that stuff will get us sick!
GID00016701	A rocket! Yay! Vrooom!
GID00016702	Ick! My big sister got super sick chewing that stuff!
GID00016703	Bye then.
GID00016704	I sure would! Thanks a billion!
GID00016705	Nuh uh! That gum gets dinosaurs sick.
GID00016706	Okay, see ya!
GID00016707	This is spiffy! Thanks!
GID00016708	No way, I hear that stuff rots your brain and stuff.
GID00016709	Okay, see ya!
GID00016710	You may pass!
GID00016711	This toll only accepts toys, and that gum is gross.
GID00016712	Okay, see ya!
GID00016713	Great! I've been wanting a new toy!
GID00016714	Red-Brick never touches chems! That stuff will tear you up!
GID00016715	Okay, see ya!
GID00016716	La Fantoma needs no rocket... But this one is pretty awesome!
GID00016717	La Fantoma doesn't want to ge sick again! No nasty gum for her!
GID00016718	Okay, see ya!
GID00016719	No, none at all. We've been traveling together since I picked her up a few days ago, and she's been friendly this whole time.
GID00016720	We'd actually been flirting a little when she suddenly pulled a gun out and began yelling at me to hand my caps over.
GID00016721	Now that I think of it, though, she laughed when I threw her my money. I think what she really wanted was my lucky charm necklace.
GID00016722	It has come to our attention that some of our loyal customers are less than pleased with the reward for their Sunset Sarsaparilla Stars.
GID00016723	Our motto at Sunset Sarsaparilla is that the customer always comes first, so we have seen fit to provide an alternate reward for your Stars.
GID00016724	Head through the double doors and take a left at the intersection. Follow the hallway all the way to its end, and you'll come to our prize vault.
GID00016725	An attendant will be there to distribute your prize. We here at Sunset Sarsaparilla would like to thank you once again for your patronage.
GID00016726	Lucky Horseshoes is played with cards numbered two through ten and aces, which have a value of one.
GID00016727	You and ol' Festus will take turns drawing cards. Each time we draw a card, we add it to our total, trying to hit the magic number of twenty one.
GID00016728	If either of us draws a card that brings our total up to the same number as the other, it pushes the other player's total up one.
GID00016729	When this happens, it's called Lucky Horseshoes! Ol' Festus thought of the name himself, I'll have you know.
GID00016730	When one of us is closer to twenty one and the other can't get any closer, either by going over or because he or she held, the closer player wins.
GID00016731	Ol' Festus likes the game because there are no ties in Lucky Horseshoes. If someone's sitting pretty on twenty one, lady luck can still bump 'em off!
GID00016732	But enough jawing. By now you're as eager as I am to get tossing.
GID00016733	Looooong ago, people didn't really have many choices when it came to soft drinks. It was either water, or Nuka-cola.
GID00016734	The next day, the man came downstairs to find a single bottle with a note beneath it on the bar.
GID00016735	The man picked up the note, and found it contained a recipe for making a sarsaparilla-flavored drink, and was signed with a blue star.
GID00016736	Opening the bottle, the man found the inside of the cap had the same blue star on it. He also found that the drink was delicious.
GID00016737	That night, the local sheriff visited the saloon and reported that the stranger had been found on the side of the town road, murdered.
GID00016738	He had apparently been attacked by bandits on his way to the saloon the previous day.
GID00016739	Stunned by the news, the man told the sheriff about the note, bottle, and the deal he had with the stranger.
GID00016740	The sheriff suggested that maybe the bandits, in a fit of remorse, delivered the items. After taking all of the stranger's money, of course.
GID00016741	Now, I don't know about you, but old Festus here never met a bandit that felt anything akin to remorse.
GID00016742	The man felt the same, and had his own idea about what had happened. He went on to become rich selling the sarsaparilla drink, and started a company.
GID00016743	Now, the threat of legal action forces me to say that Nuka-cola is a swell beverage, but sometimes people just wanted something different, you know?
GID00016744	So one day a man, a saloon owner in a small town, decided to make a new type of soft drink, something that tasted far different than anything else.
GID00016745	But the man was at a loss as to what kind of flavor to use. He asked all of his patrons for ideas, but they were no help at all.
GID00016746	Then one day, a stranger walked into the saloon. When asked what he'd like, the stranger replied, "You got anything with sarsaparilla in it?"
GID00016747	The man had never heard of a drink with sarsaparilla in it, and said so. The stranger told the man that he'd make a deal with him.
GID00016748	If the man bought the ingredients, the stranger promised to meet him by sundown the next day and teach him how to make a sarsaparilla drink.
GID00016749	The man happily agreed to the deal, and had the ingredients waiting the following day. But the sun came and went, and the stranger never came.
GID00016750	The man figured he had been tricked and went to sleep, leaving the ingredients he had purchased down by the bar.
GID00016751	All right, let's play, pardner! Press the blue button to draw a card, the red button to hold, or the yeller button to quit.
GID00016752	I suppose so. Sorry, this isn't your problem, I shouldn't be going on to you about this.
GID00016753	This is an unexpected variable. I had hoped to coast on an easy wave of mediocrity to a cushy government pension.
GID00016754	Your insults are both unhelpful and unwanted. I'll thank you to keep them to yourself.
GID00016755	And how would you propose accomplishing such a goal?
GID00016756	Hmm... an intriguing proposition.
GID00016757	Company readiness reports are logged on the computer systems at the Resort. If you hack the system, you could alter our records.
GID00016758	Such an attempt, however, is likely to thwart efforts to motivate the squad to do actual work. If such is your goal, you should look elsewhere.
GID00016759	Oh, that's right! Here, let me show you what I've got on hand.
GID00016760	There's not much more to tell. Get enough stars and the treasure's yours. Just watch out for some of the other people collecting them.
GID00016761	If you say so. Maybe we'll meet again.
GID00016762	I am now. I was just minding my own business heading west when that psycho came out of nowhere and started shooting!
GID00016763	He kept shouting about stars or something. Does that make any sense to you?
GID00016764	< sniff >
GID00016765	All right. I guess that about does it.
GID00016766	Come with me. I'll see you out.
GID00016767	House.
GID00016768	House.
GID00016769	House.
GID00016770	House.
GID00016771	House.
GID00016772	House.
GID00016773	Night.
GID00016774	Night.
GID00016775	Night.

GID00016782	Bandit.
GID00016783	Bandit.
GID00016784	Bandit.
GID00016785	Light.
GID00016786	Light.
GID00016787	Light.
GID00016788	Light.
GID00016789	Light.
GID00016790	Light.
GID00016791	Mother.
GID00016792	Mother.
GID00016793	Mother.
GID00016794	Mother.
GID00016795	Mother.
GID00016796	Mother.
GID00016797	Okay. Now I got a few statements. I want you to tell me how much they sound like something you'd say.
GID00016798	First one. "Conflict just ain't in my nature."
GID00016799	Okay. Now I've got a few statements. I want you to tell me how much they sound like something you'd say.
GID00016800	First one. "Conflict just ain't in my nature."
GID00016801	Okay. Now I've got a few statements. I want you to tell me how much they sound like something you'd say.
GID00016802	First one. "Conflict just ain't in my nature."
GID00016803	Okay. Now I've got a few statements. I want you to tell me how much they sound like something you'd say.
GID00016804	First one. "Conflict just ain't in my nature."
GID00016805	Okay. Now I've got a few statements. I want you to tell me how much they sound like something you'd say.
GID00016806	First one. "Conflict just ain't in my nature."
GID00016807	Okay. Now I've got a few statements. I want you to tell me how much they sound like something you'd say.
GID00016808	First one. "Conflict just ain't in my nature."
GID00016809	Hmm. Sometimes when you give tests like this, you learn more than you was hoping for, and I reckon that ain't always the best thing.
GID00016810	But I guess maybe it explains a thing or two about your predicament.
GID00016811	Okay. Now I've got a few statements. I want you to tell me how much they sound like something you'd say.
GID00016812	First one. "Conflict just ain't in my nature."
GID00016813	"I ain't given to relying on others for support."
GID00016814	"I ain't given to relying on others for support."
GID00016815	"I ain't given to relying on others for support."
GID00016816	"I ain't given to relying on others for support."
GID00016817	"I ain't given to relying on others for support."
GID00016818	"I'm always fixing to be the center of attention."
GID00016819	"I'm always fixing to be the center of attention."
GID00016820	"I'm always fixing to be the center of attention."
GID00016821	"I'm always fixing to be the center of attention."
GID00016822	"I'm always fixing to be the center of attention."
GID00016823	"I'm slow to embrace new ideas."
GID00016824	"I'm slow to embrace new ideas."
GID00016825	"I'm slow to embrace new ideas."
GID00016826	"I'm slow to embrace new ideas."
GID00016827	"I'm slow to embrace new ideas."
GID00016828	"I charge in to deal with my problems head-on."
GID00016829	"I charge in to deal with my problems head-on."
GID00016830	"I charge in to deal with my problems head-on."
GID00016831	"I charge in to deal with my problems head-on."
GID00016832	"I charge in to deal with my problems head-on."
GID00016833	Almost done here. What do you say you have a look at this? Tell me what you see.
GID00016834	Almost done here. What do you say you have a look at this? Tell me what you see.
GID00016835	Almost done here. What do you say you have a look at this? Tell me what you see.
GID00016836	Almost done here. What do you say you have a look at this? Tell me what you see.
GID00016837	Almost done here. What do you say you have a look at this? Tell me what you see.
GID00016838	Okay. How about this one?
GID00016839	Okay. How about this one?
GID00016840	Okay. How about this one?
GID00016841	Okay. How about this one?
GID00016842	Okay. How about this one?
GID00016843	Last one.
GID00016844	Last one.
GID00016845	Last one.
GID00016846	Last one.
GID00016847	Well, that's all she wrote.
GID00016848	I don't have nothing to compare it to, so maybe you'd better just have a look at the results. See if it all seems right to you.
GID00016849	Very interesting. Maybe a little disturbing, but interesting.
GID00016850	I don't have nothing to compare it to, so maybe you'd better just have a look at the results. See if it all seems right to you.
GID00016851	Well, that's all she wrote.
GID00016852	I don't have nothing to compare it to, so maybe you'd better just have a look at the results. See if it all seems right to you.
GID00016853	Well, that's all she wrote.
GID00016854	I don't have nothing to compare it to, so maybe you'd better just have a look at the results. See if it all seems right to you.
GID00016855	Well, that's all she wrote.
GID00016856	I don't have nothing to compare it to, so maybe you'd better just have a look at the results. See if it all seems right to you.
GID00016857	Well, if you're heading back out there, you ought to have this.
GID00016858	They call it a Pip-Boy. I grew up in one of them vaults they made before the war. We all got one.
GID00016859	Ain't much use to me now, but you might want such a thing, after what you been through. I know what it's like, having something taken from you.
GID00016860	And put this on, too, so the locals don't pick on you for lacking modesty. Was my wife's.
GID00016861	I think she was about your size, and she hardly wore it after we left the vault. Felt it was too brazen.
GID00016862	And put this on, too, so the locals don't pick on you for lacking modesty. Never was much my style anyway.
GID00016863	You should talk to Sunny Smiles before you leave town. She can help you learn to fend for yourself in the desert. She'll likely be at the saloon.
GID00016864	I reckon some of the other folks at the saloon might be able to help you out, too. And the metal fella, Victor, who pulled you outta your grave.
GID00016865	Anyway, you ever get hurt out there, you come right back. I'll fix you up.
GID00016866	But try not to get killed anymore.
GID00016867	Oh, before I forget, one of the townsfolk dropped this off. Said they found it near where Victor found you, and guessed it might be yours.
GID00016868	Oh, before I forget, one of the townsfolk dropped these off. Said they found them near where Victor found you, and guessed they might be yours.
GID00016869	Well, we know your vitals are good.
GID00016870	But that don't mean them bullets didn't leave you nuttier than a Bighorner dropping.
GID00016871	What do you say you take a seat on my couch and we go through a couple questions? See if your dogs are still barking.
GID00016872	Before I turn you loose, I need one more thing from you.
GID00016873	I got a form for you to fill out, so I can get a sense of your medical history.
GID00016874	Just a formality. Ain't like I expect to find you got a family history of getting shot in the head.
GID00016875	Southeast of here is Primm - can't miss it, since it has this giant old rollercoaster right in the middle of town. The NCR's got an outpost there.
GID00016876	If you follow the road north, you'll eventually hit Sloan and Quarry Junction. They mine rocks or something, but I heard they got troubles lately.
GID00016877	I wouldn't head that direction if I were you, though. Got critters up there that don't take kindly to getting shot.
GID00016878	Around here, mostly coyotes and geckos. The coyotes are pretty dangerous in large packs, but otherwise they're nothing to really worry about.
GID00016879	The geckos aren't too tough, but they've got a nasty bite. I've heard about bigger, nastier versions out in the wasteland, but I've never seen them.
GID00016880	Stick to the roads when you can, and steer clear of the hills north of Goodsprings. The critters up there are big and poisonous.
GID00016881	If you want to know anything else, just ask.
GID00016882	[SUCCEEDED] If you're willing to take the risk, be my guest.
GID00016883	I've got it set to broadcast a powerful signal at 24,000 hertz. Just place it near their nest and cross your fingers.
GID00016884	Signal's too high for people to hear, so no harm done, but it might make you feel sick to your stomach.
GID00016885	[FAILED] I don't even know what the hell you're talking about. Sounds like gibberish.
GID00016886	We'll keep that in mind. Now, if you're not going to buy something, get out.
GID00016887	She does? You mean it? That's incredible!
GID00016888	What happens next? Can she come here? How do we make sure she doesn't get blown up? Should I talk to the gunners? Or to Pearl?
GID00016889	Okay, I'm just really excited is all.
GID00016890	Oh, well let me know when you do.
GID00016891	Did I say that? Sometimes I just say stupid things! Sorry about that.
GID00016892	Pearl will tell you when the time comes. If, I mean. I should really be going.
GID00016893	Thanks. Sometimes I talk too much. I guess you already know that.
GID00016894	You said you'd talk to her. Don't treat me like a jerk for asking.
GID00016895	Well, please, talk to her soon. The suspense is killing me!
GID00016896	What are you waiting for? I've been losing sleep wonder what she'll say!
GID00016897	Here take this Boomer outfit. I'll let the gunners know she is coming, and not to shoot at her.
GID00016898	Wow, that seems dangerous, but if you really think it's safe, I'll trust you. You did make it here, afterall.
GID00016899	I wish we'd blown you up! I wish you were dead! Just leave me alone!
GID00016900	[SUCCEEDED] Oh, my sweet blameless Red! Curse the walls of Nellis! Curse our guns and isolation! Her blood is on our hands!
GID00016901	Only if we stop shelling everyone who comes close will some good come from this tragedy. If you'll excuse me...
GID00016902	[FAILED] Then why didn't you stop her? You could've tackled her or something! You knew how much she meant to me!
GID00016903	Just - just go away!
GID00016904	Did I misunderstand what Pearl said? All right. Goodbye.
GID00016905	Ain't nothing creepy about it. It's a term of respect!
GID00016906	I know it does, but I tell you, it ain't! I've worked it out so it's simple!
GID00016907	Maybe you don't understand. Hasn't been one of us, not a one, to set a foot outside Nellis in over fifty years.
GID00016908	You come along, with your knowledge of the outside, and it seems the time's come to raise the Lady after all.
GID00016909	Good. Here's the deployable ballast. Go find the plane, attach the ballast, and hit the button!
GID00016910	No, it's not. It's the smartest idea you ever heard, but you're too stupid to know it!
GID00016911	Might try holding your breath. If that doesn't sound good enough, talk to Jack. He was working on a rebreather once.
GID00016912	Are you sure you know what you're doing? You nearly killed that man!
GID00016913	You've made him worse! Is that what you savages call medicine?
GID00016914	Were you exaggerating your knowledge of medicine? Even I would've known not to do that!
GID00016915	Now I know what they mean by "dumb luck"!
GID00016916	You're welcome to try - hell, maybe they'll listen to somebody they don't see as an authority figure.
GID00016917	I'd be skeptical of the odds, myself. I just hope they figure it out before it comes to that.
GID00016918	I suppose if you must stick with your narrow, parochial view of "in charge," then yes, it's a no. Are we done?
GID00016919	Genius is seldom appreciated in its own time.
GID00016920	[FAILED] Why would I? If this unit improves its performance, we'll be shipped to the front lines. That's hardly conducive to living a long life.
GID00016921	[SUCCEEDED] Hmm. You're trying to appeal to my ego. I must admit, it's an effective tactic. All right - I'll help.
GID00016922	But only because I want to see if it's even possible.
GID00016923	[FAILED] Hey, you asked. Don't want the answer, don't ask a guy's opinion.
GID00016924	[SUCCEEDED] Shit, maybe you're right. Guess I ought to give them a shot.
GID00016925	Whatever. Not like I need any of them. I do just fine on my own.
GID00016926	Don't apologize. Their care is my responsibility, but everything I know came from an old first aid field manual.
GID00016927	I don't know what else to do to help them...
GID00016928	[SUCCEEDED] If what you say is true, you can do us a world of good.
GID00016929	[FAILED] No need to apologize. Their care is my responsibility, not yours. Thing is, everything I know came out of a first aid handbook!
GID00016930	If you think you know more than that, let me know.
GID00016931	[FAILED] These patients were gravely injured. It's not a joking matter!
GID00016932	[SUCCEEDED] Well... I don't know, actually... I suppose it's possible. You should take a look!
GID00016933	Mister Cuddles is my teddy. I lost him and I don't remember where.
GID00016934	Oh. Bye then.
GID00016935	Thanks! Let me know when you find him.
GID00016936	Oh, I remember now! I was playing hide and seek in the big hangar! Mister Loyal made us leave though.
GID00016937	Thanks! Let me know when you find him.
GID00016938	Oh! Thank you so much! I'll never lose you again Mister Cuddles!
GID00016939	[SUCCEEDED] No! Not Mister Cuddles!
GID00016940	[SUCCEEDED] No! Not Mister Cuddles! He can't be dead!
GID00016941	[FAILED] I know you're kidding. Mister Cuddles is just hiding somewhere.
GID00016942	Okay, well thanks for looking. Let me know when you find him.
GID00016943	You picked a good time to stop by, for we're swimming in problems. My youngers can tell you all about it.
GID00016944	Raquel could use help with the bug problem, Doc Argyll has wounded he's tending to, and Loyal and Jack might be looking for help with some repairs.
GID00016945	Or you could just go see Pete at the museum and hear the story of our people. All you have to do there is listen.
GID00016946	Come and go as you like, help or don't help, I leave it up to you. But I hope you'll show my youngers that not every outsider needs to be blown up.
GID00016947	[SUCCEEDED] You have to keep in mind that you're our first contact with the outside world since I was barely a woman.
GID00016948	Seclusion has kept us safe. but the world around us is changing. Neon lights in the distance, patrolling robots, soldiers...
GID00016949	My youngers think our guns can keep out the world, but I think we need to let it in, just a little, or become its victim.
GID00016950	You're that little bit of the world, child. Welcome to Nellis.
GID00016951	[FAILED] If I were your grandma, I'd wash out your mouth with Abraxo for being so rude, child!
GID00016952	I'll send word to the spotters to let you come and go as you wish. Why not stay awhile before you head out?
GID00016953	Long story short, the power failed a few days ago because giant ants have tunneled into the generator room and set up a nest.
GID00016954	I led a team down to exterminate them, but there were... so many of them. We lost two killed, three wounded.
GID00016955	Personally, I think it's more than a savage can handle, but if you want to kill those ants and switch the power back on, feel free.
GID00016956	All I need is a pretext.
GID00016957	We haven't seen the last of each other, savage.
GID00016958	Get those ants handled, savage.
GID00016959	Stay out of trouble.
GID00016960	Sure, anyone can. But there's more than a few down there. See for yourself.
GID00016961	One other thing. The ants must be eating gunpowder from the munitions down there, or something.
GID00016962	They exploded when hit by a flamethrower. One of us was using a laser pistol - same thing. Bullets seem okay, just don't hit the artillery shells.
GID00016963	Loyal's been working on some kind of weapon to use against them. Maybe you should check with him.
GID00016964	Don't get my hopes up.
GID00016965	One other thing. The ants must be eating gunpowder from the munitions down there, or something.
GID00016966	They exploded when hit by a flamethrower. One of us was using a laser pistol - same thing. Bullets seem okay, just don't hit the artillery shells.
GID00016967	Loyal's been working on some kind of weapon to use against them. Maybe you should check with him.
GID00016968	A savage, scared of bugs? I don't believe it. I'm sure you'll change your mind.
GID00016969	One other thing. The ants must be eating gunpowder from the munitions down there, or something.
GID00016970	They exploded when hit by a flamethrower. One of us was using a laser pistol - same thing. Bullets seem okay, just don't hit the artillery shells.
GID00016971	Loyal's been working on some kind of weapon to use against them. Maybe you should check with him.
GID00016972	It's not in progress if you're up here talking to me. Get it taken care of.
GID00016973	If that's so, why isn't the power back on? Remember how I told you to power up the generators when the ants are dead?
GID00016974	Looks like you've still got some work left to do.
GID00016975	Maybe Pearl is right about you, because I don't know how you pulled that off.
GID00016976	I'll tell Loyal to send someone down to clear out the eggs and repair the generators. Good work.
GID00016977	I didn't tell you to kill most of the ants. It's an either-or proposition. Get down there and finish them off.
GID00016978	[SUCCEEDED] Maybe Pearl is right about you, because I don't know how you pulled that off.
GID00016979	I'll tell Loyal to send someone down to clear out the eggs and repair the generators. Good work.
GID00016980	[FAILED] You're a terrible liar. Get down there and clear out those ants.
GID00016981	I already said you did a good job. I don't give out hugs.
GID00016982	"You may have missed an ant or two?" Get back down there and finish those ants off!
GID00016983	Well, look elsewhere. I can't let you near a patient after what happened.
GID00016984	You're finished? So are they, I'm afraid. Your medicine was almost as dangerous to them as those giant ants!
GID00016985	You did more harm than good, I think. Your heart was in the right place, at least.
GID00016986	Those men owe you their lives. Seems we could learn a thing or two from you savages, when it comes to medicine, at least.
GID00016987	Well, there are still patients left to treat... though I worry you'll just make them worse.
GID00016988	There are still patients in need of treatment. Help them if you can.
GID00016989	I have three patients here who were gravely injured fighting those giant ants in the generator building a few days ago.
GID00016990	I've stabilized their wounds, but they're in bad shape. Do you have medical training?
GID00016991	Seeing as you're a friend of ours, I suppose we could trade for what you need.
GID00016992	I'm afraid medications are in short supply. Maybe you should seek medical treatment away from Nellis.
GID00016993	Goodbye.
GID00016994	Hold it right there! You had no business treating that man. You may've spared him a lingering death, but that's straight-out malpractice.
GID00016995	At least a dozen, I'd say. And that was just the group that attacked us. For all I know, they've got a lot more friends lurking around.
GID00016996	I saw you being awfully friendly with Joe Cobb, so no thanks.
GID00016997	No thanks. I think we'd need some of Goodsprings on our side, and I hear you're not exactly friendly with them.
GID00016998	We'd just end up sharing the same grave if it's just the two of us. Now, if some of the other people in town were also on board...
GID00016999	Start with Sunny Smiles. She's been friendlier than most around here.
GID00017000	I was thinking of myself, actually. Who's going to watch my back while I'm watching yours?
GID00017001	Well, I guess that means we're ready to go. Unless you think there's something else you can do?
GID00017002	Try to hurry.
GID00017003	Oh. Well, I don't want to make a move until she's with us.
GID00017004	I'll be waiting.
GID00017005	Until next time.
GID00017006	Joe Cobb talks about leaving us alone if we hand over Ringo, but I know his type. He and his friends will come after the town eventually.
GID00017007	However, between you, me, and Ringo, we aren't exactly a force to be reckoned with. A lot of people around here look up to Trudy.
GID00017008	If you could convince Trudy to join us, some of the folks in town might decide to help out as well.
GID00017009	I know Easy Pete's got a stock of dynamite somewhere, and Chet just got a shipment of leather armor we could borrow. Talk to them as well.
GID00017010	Finally, there's a good chance we'll all end up with extra holes in us, so if Doc Mitchell could cough up some extra stimpaks, that'd be great.
GID00017011	Even though Joe Cobb's dead, his friends will come after the town eventually.
GID00017012	However, between you, me, and Ringo, we aren't exactly a force to be reckoned with. A lot of people around here look up to Trudy.
GID00017013	If you could convince Trudy to join us, some of the folks in town might decide to help out as well.
GID00017014	I know Easy Pete's got a stock of dynamite somewhere, and Chet just got a shipment of leather armor we could borrow. Talk to them as well.
GID00017015	Finally, there's a good chance we'll all end up with extra holes in us, so if Doc Mitchell could cough up some extra stimpaks, that'd be great.
GID00017016	Just like that. I have a feeling that I'm going to end up fighting those guys one way or another, so I might as well get it over with.
GID00017017	That's inspiring. You might want to keep your optimism to yourself if you try to recruit anyone else.
GID00017018	Cobb hasn't exactly been looking for Ringo too hard - I think he's afraid that Ringo will ambush him, which is probably true.
GID00017019	I'm done being nice. If you don't hand Ringo over soon, I'm going to get my friends and we're burning this town to the ground, got it?
GID00017020	Sorry, son. I fixed up your head as best I knew how. I guess I missed a spot.
GID00017021	Sorry, little lady. I fixed up your head as best I knew how. Guess I missed a spot.
GID00017022	Look at that. Maybe them bullets done your brain some good.
GID00017023	Now that don't make a lick of sense. Seems to me you're the luckiest son-of-a-gun in New Vegas.
GID00017024	With luck like yours I'm surprised them bullets didn't just turn right around and climb back into the gun.
GID00017025	That's some serious atrophy, even for someone who's been in bed awhile. It's a wonder you can move at all.
GID00017026	Surprised anybody'd want to tangle with you. Heck, you could go Deathclaw hunting with a switch.
GID00017027	I just don't get it. A stiff breeze'd tear you in two but a couple of bullets and you're right as rain.
GID00017028	I guess that explains how you're still alive. You're built solid as an oak.
GID00017029	Huh. Must be some frontal lobe damage.
GID00017030	Good to see them bullets didn't affect your charm none.
GID00017031	Now I ain't no optometrist, but maybe we should fit you for some glasses while you're here.
GID00017032	Nothing gets by you, huh? Coulda used you when I lost my keys last month.
GID00017033	Don't have all your coordination back yet, looks like. You should think about doing some rehab.
GID00017034	Most patients don't get out of bed after being shot and then move like they was in perfect control. You're unusual, I'll say that.
GID00017035	Yep, that's a pretty standard score there. But after what you been through, I'd say that's great news.
GID00017036	You're awake. How about that.
GID00017037	Whoa, easy there. Easy. You been out cold a couple of days now.
GID00017038	Why don't you just relax a second? Get your bearings.
GID00017039	Let's see what the damage is. How about your name? Can you tell me your name?
GID00017040	Huh. Can't say it's what I'd have picked for you. But if that's your name, that's your name.
GID00017041	I'm Doc Mitchell. Welcome to Goodsprings.
GID00017042	Now, I hope you don't mind, but I had to go rooting around there in your noggin to pull all the bits of lead out.
GID00017043	I take pride in my needlework, but you'd better tell me if I left anything out of place.
GID00017044	How'd I do?
GID00017045	Well, I got most of it right, anyway. Stuff that mattered.
GID00017046	Okay. No sense keeping you in bed anymore. Let's see if we can get you on your feet.
GID00017047	Good. Why don't you walk down to the end of the room? Over by that vigor tester machine there.
GID00017048	Take it slow now. It ain't a race.
GID00017049	Looking good so far. Go ahead and give the vigor tester a try. We'll learn right quick if you got back all your faculties.
GID00017050	Let's go into the next room. I've got a few more tests I'd like to run.
GID00017051	Take it easy now.
GID00017052	[SUCCEEDED] You made your point. I can provide people with some leather armor and extra ammo. I sure hope it's worth it.
GID00017053	And, uh, I'll be guarding the store while all this is going on. I have to put my business first, you understand.
GID00017054	[FAILED] Look, you're bringing this on yourselves. There's no way I'm getting involved. But, hey, I'm sure you can buy what you need...
GID00017055	Right. Just keep me out of it. Is there anything else?
GID00017056	[SUCCEEDED] Uh huh. Guess you know what you're doing. I'll go dig it up and get it ready. You'll have it by the time the fighting starts.
GID00017057	[FAILED] Too dangerous, sorry. Blow yourself up, blow your neighbor up, blow the whole town up.
GID00017058	Keep your gun handy if you go poking around some of the abandoned places around here, like the schoolhouse.
GID00017059	Wasteland critters like to move in when Sunny's not looking, so watch out.
GID00017060	Yup.
GID00017061	Welcome.
GID00017062	Uh huh.
GID00017063	Be careful out there.
GID00017064	He's holed up at the abandoned gas station up the hill.
GID00017065	You mean murder him? That's not our way, even if Cobb is scum. He can bluster and threaten all he wants.
GID00017066	Some of the others, like Sunny, will probably stand up for Ringo if he asks for help, which he hasn't.
GID00017067	Personally, I hope he sneaks out of town one night and takes the Powder Gangers with him.
GID00017068	Then just - just stay where you are! Raquel'll be here any second...
GID00017069	I said stay where you are! Raquel'll be here any second...
GID00017070	Watch your mouth, savage! Raquel'll be here any second...
GID00017071	Follow close - and mind your behavior.
GID00017072	I oversee the security of the Nellis homeland, from the coordination of its defenses to the training and fitness of its population.
GID00017073	I wasn't the one firing the howitzers. If you want to see how good I am at killing savages, I can show you.
GID00017074	Or you can accept Mother Pearl's invitation. It's your choice.
GID00017075	You appear to require assistance. I'll go find someone.
GID00017076	It's a simple idea: the Army offers fiscal security and generous benefits at the cost of substantial personal risk - if you're on the front line.
GID00017077	If you perform too poorly, they'll scrub you out. Perform too well, and you get sent to the front lines.
GID00017078	All I have to do is ride that mediocrity gradient to a cushy, do-nothing job miles away from the war.
GID00017079	To what purpose? It's highly unlikely you'd understand anything I'd say.
GID00017080	Suffice to say I'm a certified genius, and when I'm discharged from this pit of testosterone and failure, I'll have all the money I could ever need.
GID00017081	In a strictly official capacity, no.
GID00017082	However, as I am by far the most intelligent and resourceful figure on this base, I feel it's safe to say the soldiers here look up to me.
GID00017083	Well, as it turns out, we had a string of bad harvests a few years back. Pa said he couldn't afford to feed but three youngins, or we'd starve.
GID00017084	As the biggest one it was my job to go join the Army so's my sisters could eat and so's we wouldn't all be killed by raiders and Jesus would love us.
GID00017085	It's all right, I guess. I don't like all the fighting we gotta do, though.
GID00017086	Oh, it's a fine place. The lake is real pretty, and we don't get bothered much by them Legion fellers.
GID00017087	I ain't scared! I just don't like hurting folks, is all. Ma always used to tell me "boy, you're the biggest and the strongest, so you mind yourself!"
GID00017088	Every day she told me that. Guess I done took it to heart.
GID00017089	Well, I was born on a farm out in California. Weren't much - me, Ma and Pa, my two sisters and about 40 acres of corn and brahmin.
GID00017090	Didn't never have no problems really, except for some lean years. Then I joined up and got shipped out here to New Vegas.
GID00017091	They're mostly pretty nice - Poindexter showed me how to make fireworks! Razz kinda scares me sometimes, but I don't mind. He's had a hard life.
GID00017092	Shit, man, it was this or the Fiends, and Fiends don't last too long in the NCR.
GID00017093	At least this way the badasses with the top-shelf guns are on my side.
GID00017094	Shit, honey, it was this or the Fiends, and Fiends don't last too long in the NCR.
GID00017095	At least this way the badasses with the top-shelf guns are on my side.
GID00017096	What you want to know? Whole place used to be some kinda rich bastard resort, back before the war.
GID00017097	Now the Rangers use the old resort, and we grunts get to live in tents. Fucking typical.
GID00017098	Ain't much to tell. Grew up out west, in the Boneyard. Heard of it?
GID00017099	Yeah, not many people have. Wasn't really a good place for kids, you know? I joined up to get out. My family's still back there.
GID00017100	We don't talk too much, mostly. Poindexter's a smartass prick.
GID00017101	O'Hanrahan's a big pussy, ain't good for shit in a fight, and Mags... well, Mags is cut out for something other than soldiering, you dig?
GID00017102	I guess I wanted to make something of myself, you know? Be the best of the best. I *wanted* to be a ranger, but... guess this is as close as I get.
GID00017103	Easy - this is where they send all the fuck-ups and people they don't want. But hey, it's not like I'm bitter or anything.
GID00017104	Not much to tell, really. I grew up in New Reno, joined up, took my shot at being a Ranger. Didn't make it, so I'm stuck with this crew of jokers.
GID00017105	Yeah. I mean, no, they're okay people, but they don't care, y'know? They don't have any ambition. No drive.
GID00017106	They're slacking off, and that reflects badly on me.
GID00017107	Man, it's my life. I joined up when I was 16 - I don't know how to do anything else.
GID00017108	I've been here since the first push into Vegas. Back in the day, this camp was the hotspot for conflicts with the Legion, raider tribes, you name it.
GID00017109	These days, I spend most of my time trying to beat a little discipline into the soldiers under my command. They've gotten soft with no action.
GID00017110	Disappointed? We call 'em the Misfits for a reason. They're undisciplined, lazy, and they have absolutely no espirit de corps.
GID00017111	The squad leader's got some promise, kid named Mags, but as for the rest... I don't see much hope.
GID00017112	I'm going to make them shape up if it kills me, though. Or them, for that matter.
GID00017113	Is that thing silver?
GID00017114	You're not getting paid to run your mouth.
GID00017115	So far you ain't paid us nothing!
GID00017116	You'll get your caps when the job's done!
GID00017117	Is this deep enough?
GID00017118	Yeah. Take that thing off.
GID00017119	Real shame you got caught up in this, kid. Must seem like bad luck.
GID00017120	Truth is, game was rigged from the start.
GID00017121	That the thing you were talking about?
GID00017122	Beautiful, ain't it? It's platinum.
GID00017123	Can't see shit out here.
GID00017124	Either way, you owe us.
GID00017125	I told you, you'll get paid when we get there.
GID00017126	We just walked through hell, man.
GID00017127	What are you, dense? I don't got it here!
GID00017128	Hey. What do you want me to do with this?
GID00017129	Almost forgot. Take off the hood.
GID00017130	Well, kid, you're our last loose end.
GID00017131	Shame you had to get caught in the middle of all this. Bet you don't even know why you're here.
GID00017132	But hey, if it makes you feel any better, it's nothing personal.
GID00017133	Just bad luck.
GID00017134	Well we're not going back north. We're lucky to be alive.
GID00017135	How the hell else are we supposed to get back, genius?
GID00017136	We go east. Take the 95.
GID00017137	East? Are you nuts? That'll take us days out of our way.
GID00017138	Then you can just go back by yourself.
GID00017139	Fine. Anything to get you two to shut up.
GID00017140	Howdy, pardner! Fine evening, ain't it?
GID00017141	Friend, you look like you could use a sarsaparilla.
GID00017142	Howdy, pardner! Sure is one fine evening, ain't it?
GID00017143	Gimme your hand, pardner. Let's get you out of there.
GID00017144	You okay, pardner? You look like you could use a sarsaparilla.
GID00017145	Really? That's so sweet!
GID00017146	I'd love to go meet him. Is there any way the Boomers would let me visit Nellis?
GID00017147	Well, you don't have to do that anymore! Sounds like I better hurry to him.
GID00017148	Any chance the Boomers would let me visit Nellis?
GID00017149	Ooh, I've just got to meet him! Is there any way the Boomers would let me visit Nellis?
GID00017150	[SUCCEEDED] Really? Thank you so much! I'll get going right away.
GID00017151	[FAILED] Are you trying to get me killed? No way I'm going in there.
GID00017152	Ok, let me know when you have an idea.
GID00017153	This is so exciting! Let me know how it turns out.
GID00017154	Just my luck. I finally find the perfect guy, and he's a Boomer.
GID00017155	I was hoping you would. What's going on?
GID00017156	I was hoping you would. What's going on? Have they agreed to my safety yet?
GID00017157	Ok, talk to you soon.
GID00017158	Well, with McLafferty dead, I guess my contract is done and I'm free to leave. I'm off to meet my admirer!
GID00017159	There's one more thing. I have a work contract with the Crimson Caravan, and if I walk away, I lose the wages they owe me.
GID00017160	Could you do just one more thing for me and talk to Alice McLafferty about it? I know if I do it, she'll just say no. I'd hate to lose the money.
GID00017161	Okay, I'll be around.
GID00017162	Gee, I dunno, maybe because I'm saddled with the worst damn unit in the NCR Army? Think that might have something to do with it?
GID00017163	Please. Camp Golf is where they shuffle off anybody they don't want any more. Assignment here is a career ender.
GID00017164	[SUCCEEDED] You really think so? Hell, I guess it's worth a shot.
GID00017165	[FAILED] Yeah, right. You think Poindexter doesn't have a dozen of his crazy practical jokes all lined up if I try that?
GID00017166	I like my underwear to *not* be full of radioactive itching powder, thanks.
GID00017167	Yeah, well... I didn't want to get promoted out of the field. I didn't join up to drive a desk.
GID00017168	Thanks. I only wish some of the soldiers under my command would share some of it.
GID00017169	Yeah, well, somebody has to wrangle those washouts and losers. Somebody's got to turn them into a real fighting force.
GID00017170	Mostly drill the troops, try to keep the discipline up and combat readiness high.
GID00017171	It's not the easiest job in the world - soldiers without a mission get bored very easily.
GID00017172	Still, with the Legion just across the river, we have to be ready.
GID00017173	I'm glad that you made it out here. You're even more stunning up close than you were at a distance.
GID00017174	Of course it would. I'll have you set up with some quarters with some of the other women.
GID00017175	Okay.
GID00017176	Hi there, it is great to meet you as well.
GID00017177	And you're even more handsome up close. Do you think it'll be okay if I hang around here for a little while, so we can get to know each other better?
GID00017178	Sorry to see you go so soon. Be sure to drink a Sunset Sarsaparilla for me!
GID00017179	I watch all sorts of things with my binoculars. Who wants to know, and why?
GID00017180	Bye.
GID00017181	Alright then, goodbye.
GID00017182	Nice-looking blonde boy? I always wondered if he was watching me back! What's he like?
GID00017183	I've been in the Reaper's shadow for a long time now, and I thought he'd finally showed up to collect. He's just mocking me now.
GID00017184	[SUCCEEDED] The truth of it is that I did cut out a raider's heart, but only took a bite to mess with his buddies.
GID00017185	They had me surrounded and I went with the first thing that came to mind. Some ran, and the rest were startled just long enough.
GID00017186	[FAILED] Nope. You'll just have to keep on wondering. Heh.
GID00017187	What I could use is some scrap metal. It may not sound exciting, but around here we have to recycle every rivet and plate.
GID00017188	The other thing, you being from the outside and all, well, I guess you'd call it a personal matter but, well... Eh, forget it!
GID00017189	Like I said, I can never get enough scrap metal.
GID00017190	Me? I work with Loyal, mostly electronics work and robotics. Keeping the old technologies alive, right?
GID00017191	Thanks. That'd be great.
GID00017192	[FAILED] I'll keep my spit to myself, thank you very much. That sounded stupid, didn't it? Damn it.
GID00017193	[SUCCEEDED] That must be nice, sharing yourself like that, not being embarrassed or anything? Well, the thing is, there's this girl...
GID00017194	I just need some parts from a pressure cooker to create a hermetic seal for the rebreather.
GID00017195	Have you found a pressure cooker so I can finish the rebreather?
GID00017196	Goodbye.
GID00017197	There's an outpost near here. The signs say "Crimson Caravan?" It seems like they carry things to and fro for people out there?
GID00017198	Well, every once in a while I watch the outpost through one of the spotters' binoculars. And sometimes there's this girl there, this special girl...
GID00017199	And sometimes it's like she's watching me back with her binoculars! Except she's probably just watching Nellis. I haven't tried waving.
GID00017200	All right. See you around, I hope.
GID00017201	Then why did you make me spill my guts about it? You're an asshole!
GID00017202	Loyal's a great man, but he's getting on in years, so a younger's got to learn everything he knows. That'd be me.
GID00017203	The man knows how to fix and build just about everything that was ever made. It's not easy keeping up with him.
GID00017204	If you help him recover the Lady I figure - oh, I figure it's been a nice day. Yeah, a real nice day.
GID00017205	Loyal's a great man, but he's getting on in years, so a younger's got to learn everything he knows. That'd be me.
GID00017206	The man knows how to fix and build just about everything that was ever made. It's not easy keeping up with him.
GID00017207	Oh come on, you've met Loyal by now. He's a mechanical genius.
GID00017208	The man knows how to fix and build just about everything that was ever made. It's not easy keeping up with him.
GID00017209	Oh, you can't miss her! She has short red hair and she's the most beautiful woman who ever lived!
GID00017210	You'd really talk to her for me? What if she feels the same way? What if she comes here like you did?
GID00017211	What if she gets blown up? What if she doesn't like me?
GID00017212	Oh jeez, I better just let you handle it. I'm better with machines. They don't make my stomach queasy like this!
GID00017213	Oh, you can't miss her! She has short red hair and she's the most beautiful woman who ever lived!
GID00017214	You'd really talk to her for me? What if she feels the same way? What if she comes here like you did?
GID00017215	What if she gets blown up? What if she doesn't like me?
GID00017216	Oh jeez, I better just let you handle it. I'm better with machines. They don't make my stomach queasy like this!
GID00017217	That would be amazing. As in, I would thank you forever.
GID00017218	Cool! How much can you spare?
GID00017219	See you later!
GID00017220	But I had you zeroed in the whole time! Nobody's that fast!
GID00017221	Move a muscle now and I'll blow you to pieces!
GID00017222	Are you even human? Some kind of mutant?
GID00017223	Move a muscle now and I'll blow you to pieces!
GID00017224	I'm not telling you a thing, savage!
GID00017225	Move a muscle now and I'll blow you to pieces!
GID00017226	Oh lordy lordy, you haven't heard of the Boomers? What rock have you been living under?
GID00017227	They're a bunch of artillery-slingin' grenade lobbin' odd-jobs camping out in Nellis. Wander into their territory and you're as good as mincemeat!
GID00017228	Suit yourself. Come back and see me when you get tired of picking shrapnel out of your backside.
GID00017229	There is a way, and I'll tell you... for a little wager?
GID00017230	Thanks.
GID00017231	Hey thanks!
GID00017232	Thanks for dropping it off. Anything else?
GID00017233	If that's so, how about you look into repairing the solar arrays on the roof of the generator building?
GID00017234	Nothing too complicated about it, but it's a long ways to walk my old bones, and there's been that ant problem over near there.
GID00017235	You can't miss the array. It's on top of the generator building smack dab in the middle of Nellis between the two runways.
GID00017236	I started building a sonic emitter that might do the trick, but it's useless without knowing the exact frequency that would kill the ants.
GID00017237	[SUCCEEDED] Hot damn, you're right! It's a matter of boosting across those thresholds, not exact amplitude. You're smarter than you look.
GID00017238	Just so happens I was testing it at 24,000 hertz, so it should be good to go. Place it near their nest and cross your fingers.
GID00017239	Signal's too high for people to hear, so no harm done, but it might make you feel sick to your stomach.
GID00017240	[FAILED] No, it doesn't have a dial! It has to be stabilized for an exact frequency or it could shake itself apart!
GID00017241	A long time ago - long before the war that killed just about everything that ever lived - a bomber crashed not far from here.
GID00017242	A bomber was a flying contraption that could drop explosives down on anything it flew over. But anyway, moving on...
GID00017243	This bomber crashed down in Lake Mead, pretty damn near intact. When we got to Nellis, see, I found this article in a magazine all about it.
GID00017244	There was another B-29 around here, part of a museum. Couldn't fly, but had a lot of spare parts, see? Get where I'm going?
GID00017245	Since I was a young man, I've dreamed of raising that Lady from the lake and bringing her back to life. What do you say?
GID00017246	It's at the bottom of Lake Mead. I'll mark its location on your Pip-boy map.
GID00017247	Simple! Attach deployable ballast to the plane and float it on up!
GID00017248	Here is a remote detonator. Once the ballast is attached to the plane just hit the detonator from the shore and let buoyancy handle the rest.
GID00017249	I told you, at the bottom of Lake Mead! I'll make sure the location is displayed on your Pip-boy map.
GID00017250	I wish you'd paid attention the first time! All you need to do is attach the deployable ballast to the plane.
GID00017251	Some of my robots will carry a remote activation station out to the shore. Attach the ballast, hit a button, and they'll handle the rest.
GID00017252	That's tremendous! I'll transmit instructions to the robots to start packing up the plane to bring it back to Nellis!
GID00017253	I haven't heard anything. You must not be trying hard enough.
GID00017254	I may have heard a compliment or two. Nothing special.
GID00017255	I do believe you've convinced one or two of us that it's better you made it here than were blown to smithereens.
GID00017256	More and more, I hear my people saying good things about you.
GID00017257	I believe the time has come for you to show your value in full. The people have come to accept having you around.
GID00017258	Find Loyal and ask him about our people's fondest dream. He will tell you what to do next.
GID00017259	Each of the elders would appreciate assistance with various issues here in Nellis.
GID00017260	Seek out Jack, Loyal, Raquel, and Argyll. They will guide you.
GID00017261	Loyal still needs help getting the plane back to Nellis, and there may be others who still require assistance.
GID00017262	What you have done for us is a miracle, child. You have fulfilled the only dreams we ever had outside our walls.
GID00017263	You are a trusted friend of us all. If there is ever a way for us to help you, child, tell me and I will make it so.
GID00017264	Extraordinary, child. Go tell Loyal, then return to me.
GID00017265	Goodbye.
GID00017266	Me? I'm Pete, Keeper of the Story.
GID00017267	I know I seem kind of young. I was the apprentice Keeper of the Story until a couple months ago, but ol' Keeper Don, well...
GID00017268	Whiskey and land mines don't go together. So it's up to me. I bet you want to know everything about us!
GID00017269	Wonderful! I'm sure you've noticed the mural on the wall of this hut. Shall I tell you what it all means?
GID00017270	Ask away.
GID00017271	Anything else you want to know?
GID00017272	Other questions you want to ask?
GID00017273	What else I can tell you?
GID00017274	I wish everyone were just as interested in our story as you are! Maybe I should act out the battles or learn how to throw my voice...
GID00017275	Oh, so many ways! Small ones to begin with, so we can get used to what it's like to have a sav- outsider around and about.
GID00017276	Should that go well, it may be you can help in big ways, too. We'll have to see.
GID00017277	Status............ operational.
GID00017278	Loading memory banks........
GID00017279	Current designation....... Koch.
GID00017280	Current mission.........
GID00017281	Warning! Primary defensive objective, designation Keely, taken by unknown hostile entities. Initiating full countermeasures.
GID00017282	Well, I know Major Dhatri is offering bounties on some of the Fiends - that's the gang that controls the southeast part of the city.
GID00017283	You can find the major at the camp just outside of the old airport.
GID00017284	Not sure how to help you with that one. Major Dhatri was offering bounties on some of the Fiends, but I hear someone took care of that recently.
GID00017285	Mahsohfabish.
GID00017286	Ha ha ha! I wash ma bown. Wesibe.
GID00017287	I have bo go. Fiebs aroub. Goobye!
GID00017288	Mmm-hm. Goobye!
GID00017289	Ba peasure is ah mah. Goobye!
GID00017290	Mmm-hm. [Points to stump of tongue in his mouth.]
GID00017291	I have bo go bow. Goobye!
GID00017292	Goobye!
GID00017293	Bye.
GID00017294	Okay! Sold!
GID00017295	That may be the worst-kept secret on the base. I'd be more surprised if you had proof he wasn't involved in criminal activity.
GID00017296	But if you have proof, you're the envy of every MP stationed here. What'd you find?
GID00017297	All right. Thanks for telling me. I'm going to have him rounded up.
GID00017298	Pretty impressive work there. Wish I could keep you around.
GID00017299	But for helping me nail this guy, I think you should have a little keepsake.
GID00017300	Here. It's not contraband, but I confiscated it from Contreras last week because he was being smarmy and I was sick of his bullshit.
GID00017301	Man, that guy's got water on the brain. Knows more about water pipes than any man should.
GID00017302	If he says we're losing water, I think the colonel would listen to that. I'll talk to him about it.
GID00017303	Anderson. I've heard of him, if it's the same guy. Water nerd from the Followers of the Apocalypse. Used to handle some of the operations for OSI.
GID00017304	I don't know what to think about the Followers. The things they do... hard to say if they're helping or hurting sometimes. Especially in Freeside.
GID00017305	I'll have to send some people out there to make sure we don't lose any more water. That stuff's like gold out here.
GID00017306	But you. I owe you for this. You saved me a lot of work. And I'm sure Corporal White's family will be grateful to at least get some closure.
GID00017307	The MPs keep a bunch of junk around that's confiscated off of people who decide to screw with us.
GID00017308	I haven't really sorted through it, but go ahead and see if there's anything you can use in there.
GID00017309	We keep it in a trunk across the hall, by the prison cells.
GID00017310	Shit. That's why you don't go wandering off looking for some call girl on the Strip without telling somebody first.
GID00017311	Anderson. Is that Followers of the Apocalypse Anderson?
GID00017312	Okay, well let me know if you find out anything.
GID00017313	Little bastard. I'm sure some of those find their way into the hands of our enemies, too.
GID00017314	Well, that's a shame about Corporal White. He knew better than that.
GID00017315	He's trafficking chems? I don't know how he thought he could get away with that.
GID00017316	Aw, tear my heart out, why don't you? Well, maybe you can find a way to play with his mind - get him out of his comfort zone.
GID00017317	People lose their heads and say things they regret. Especially if they underestimate you. This dickhead would underestimate a nuclear missile.
GID00017318	Plenty of ways to skin a cat, as they say. Hey, what if we skinned him? Bet he wouldn't be so smug then.
GID00017319	Get your ass up.
GID00017320	What the-
GID00017321	Move it! Move it! Move it! Get those legs up you sorry bastards!
GID00017322	Move, you lazy bastards! Do you think the legion is going to slow down for your sorry asses?!
GID00017323	Quit dragging your feet, recruit. Pick it up!
GID00017324	You run like a feeble old man, private!
GID00017325	You can rest when you're dead, private! Move your ass!
GID00017326	How the hell did you make it through boot camp, private?!
GID00017327	You think it burns now, wait until I sit on your shoulders!
GID00017328	The road to hell is paved by the bleached bones of privates that fell by the wayside, boys.
GID00017329	Pathetic! My 80-year-old grandmother runs faster than you!
GID00017330	Good thing you're not a ranger. When a ranger quits he's dead!
GID00017331	Sound off like you've got a pair!
GID00017332	That's better, but you're still not winning the battle, boys.
GID00017333	Christina hired you, huh? Well, if you're going to go up there, there's a couple things you should know.
GID00017334	Esteban's body is in the middle of those buildings up the hill there. Look carefully, and you can see the Fiends patrolling the rooftops.
GID00017335	But they laid traps, too. There's mines all over. So for godsakes, watch your feet. Get him back here. We'll get him home.
GID00017336	I wouldn't do that if I were you. Those buildings up ahead are crawling with psychos. This is as far up as we've been able to safely set up a position.
GID00017337	You go any further, we can't protect you, understand?
GID00017338	All right, smartass, I get it. You don't answer to us. But get this straight. You will get eaten alive if you go up that way.
GID00017339	And that's not a figure of speech, either. Bunch of sick, messed-up junkies control the road up there. Got a thing for desecrating corpses.
GID00017340	You've been warned.
GID00017341	Hey, it's your life.
GID00017342	Least we can do. Wish we could help more.
GID00017343	Whoa! Hold on a minute, buddy...
GID00017344	Whoa! Hold on a minute, lady...
GID00017345	Ah, shit. Well since you seem to have things figured out, the name's Keller. I'm an NCR Ranger investigating chem runners.
GID00017346	Price is in deep with the NCR for supplying ingredients to the local gangs. He's currently being held for questioning.
GID00017347	What's your business with him?
GID00017348	Well what the hell are you doing here? Get your ass out and find that metal. Don't come back until the job is done!
GID00017349	A few things here and there, but a lot of the data has been corrupted, and all of the live samples have been contaminated by the spore plants.
GID00017350	One interesting thing I found is that one of the chemicals secreted by the spore plants serves as a mild stimulant when ingested by humans.
GID00017351	As far as I can tell, it has no side effects or addictive properties, aside from the inherent psychological ones, of course.
GID00017352	Now that I think of it, there was a Cpl. Farber back at McCarran who'd probably be interested in it. There's a sample of it around here somewhere.
GID00017353	Those files need to be erased. Hold out your arm and I'll have it done in a flash.
GID00017354	To someone, I'm sure. But they constitute a threat to life as we know it. Now give me your arm already.
GID00017355	A pleasure to meet you, sir. What may I do for you?
GID00017356	A pleasure to meet you, madam. What may I do for you?
GID00017357	My, how rude. If you must know, I am here to assist my master Keely in her research.
GID00017358	Why yes, the master was here some time ago. Do you have business with her?
GID00017359	Very well, I'll get back to computing these protein sequences, then. Farewell.
GID00017367	Daniel. Probably find him back in the Residential Wing somewhere.
GID00017368	Yeah, it is yours if you help us out of here.
GID00017369	[FAILED] Help us first, then we'll give you the password, and don't think about killing me. Its all in my head.
GID00017370	[SUCCEEDED] Fine, it isn't like it is doing me any good in here. You'd better come back though.
GID00017371	Okay, but be quiet. I don't want the Fiends to hear us.
GID00017372	I don't know. Carter told me about some password he hacked out of a computer. I could give it to you, if you help us out.
GID00017373	[SUCCEEDED] Yeah, I get insomnia pretty bad myself, out here. I think it's the heat. Weird how sometimes it's cooler out here than it is inside.
GID00017374	Well, I hope you manage to get some rest. Take it easy.
GID00017375	Be straight with me. If you're onto something, I want to know about it.
GID00017376	If you were to get caught or killed, we'd lose everything you've learned about this case.
GID00017377	[FAILED] Lost, huh? If you say so. If you head over to the front terminal building you should be able to get in through the garage doors in back.
GID00017378	I'm headed that way, myself, actually, so you can just follow me if you need to.
GID00017379	See those menacing looking troopers with guns standing on the walls up there? That's Bravo Company. My company.
GID00017380	Since Oliver stuck me in a desk job, I hardly ever get to see them during the day. So sometimes I like to check up on them when they have night duty.
GID00017381	But you still haven't answered my question.
GID00017382	Damn, are you serious? He was one tough son of a bitch.
GID00017383	Good, I hated that fucker.
GID00017384	Yeah. Can't say I'm sad to hear he's gone. I should take over.
GID00017385	Must have been some NCR. I know they've been gunning for him.
GID00017386	Like anyone in their right mind would follow you.
GID00017387	Yeah, you do that.
GID00017388	So long as we understand each other.
GID00017389	I'll take a look, just to see what sort of shit they were into.
GID00017390	What?... Those bastards! Selling folks off to the Fiends? Selling children - to Cook-Cook...?
GID00017391	I've seen enough. You did everyone a service. Take these. Might help if you get a jam.
GID00017392	That's right, we will. Anything I can help you with?
GID00017393	All right, you can stop for a sec.
GID00017394	Damn right they were. And they were good, too. 'Til I popped a couple shells in their assholes. Bam! Dead, finished, over.
GID00017395	See, somebody gives me a job, I do it. Maybe I complain a little, here and there, but my shit gets done.
GID00017396	'Course you didn't. 'Cause they crossed paths with Little Buster. Bam! Dead, finished, over.
GID00017397	Oh, yeah. A lot. Like, before I was a bounty hunter, I worked as a caravan guard. You'd think that was a cakewalk, right? Wrong.
GID00017398	Crazy bastards expected me to wake up at dawn. Forget it. That's about two hours after this guy hits the sack.
GID00017399	And I need at least ten, twelve hours of sleep to do my job. Price of excellence.
GID00017400	Hey, yeah. Next time you see me, maybe I'll be rolling in a shitload of caps, right?
GID00017401	[SUCCEEDED] It's a Khan name. You know... the "Great Khans." That's what my parents were.
GID00017402	I figured I grew up around the bastards... they owed me a name, after all they put me through.
GID00017403	They're dead. Got themselves killed at Bitter Springs. Served them right, if you ask me.
GID00017404	They're scum. Lazy, trumped-up Raiders. Most of the time, they're drunk or high, and when they're not shooting chems, they're selling them.
GID00017405	Used to have a settlement up at Bitter Springs, 'til they pissed off NCR and got slaughtered for their trouble.
GID00017406	Lot of us got killed at Bitter Springs. Lot of them, I mean. My parents died, too.
GID00017407	It was massacre. That's what a lot of NCR folk will tell you. Most of them feel plenty bad about what happened.
GID00017408	But I was there. Saw it myself. I don't care what anybody says. The Khans asked for Bitter Springs. They wouldn't leave the NCR be.
GID00017409	My damn parents, too. They were just as bad as the rest.
GID00017410	Yeah. That's probably best.
GID00017411	You're sorry? Well, that makes one of us. Bitter Springs was the best thing that ever happened to me.
GID00017412	Best thing that ever happened to my parents, too. They were as bad as the rest. Worse, maybe.
GID00017413	Don't I? Mister, you never met my parents.
GID00017414	Don't I? Beg pardon, ma'am, but you never met my parents.
GID00017415	My dad, he got himself fucked up, every chance he got. Always started with folk for no reason.
GID00017416	Hell, he was the one who taught me to shoot. You know how? By taking potshots at NCR. And not just soldiers. Civilians, too. Even kids.
GID00017417	Then he'd get high with his buddies and swap tales about the folk they killed. Bunch of animals.
GID00017418	And my mom... couple times she tried to sell me to some waster, just to score some Jet. Even the other Khans said she was useless.
GID00017419	Only reason they kept her around was because she was a... how'd my dad say it... "a smokin' piece of ass."
GID00017420	In the Khans, you're not fully grown 'til you've taken a beat-down. Everybody gathers round and hits you until you're damn near dead.
GID00017421	After that - if you haven't begged for mercy - you get to choose a new name. One you'll use for the rest of your life.
GID00017422	When NCR slaughtered the Khans at Bitter Springs, I hadn't got my beat-down yet. I was still too young.
GID00017423	Way I see it, Bitter Springs was my beat-down. So afterward... I gave myself a name. It's all I've got from the Khans, and it's all I ever want.
GID00017424	Guess I could tell a pretty good story, if I had a mind. But the truth is, I don't know. Just got lucky.
GID00017425	They brought me to Dhatri after the battle. He was just a Captain, back then. Guess he saw something in me... knew I didn't belong with the Khans.
GID00017426	Maybe he felt bad, too. About how his men killed my folks. I told him he did me a service, but he didn't believe me. Still doesn't.
GID00017427	He's a good man, Dhatri. Doesn't act like it sometimes, I know. But he didn't have to take me in.
GID00017428	It's like I tell Major Dhatri. Best not look under a rock, if you don't really want to know what's there.
GID00017429	Could be that NCR found some blood on me, and none of it mine. Could be that a few of those Khans didn't die from NCR bullets.
GID00017430	I had scores of my own to settle... deeper ones than NCR ever had. Don't bother asking who they were with.
GID00017431	[FAILED] No. What's it matter to you? Why's everybody care so much about other people's business?
GID00017432	Just leave it lie. And leave me be.
GID00017433	Okay. I will. Guess that's something I'd rather not talk about, that's all.
GID00017434	All right. Goodbye.
GID00017435	Really? I never noticed that. I'm just following orders here, moving supplies as needed.
GID00017436	Good. Does that mean you have those supplies?
GID00017437	Whoa there, kiddo. No need to blow things out of proportion. I'm just selling certain ingredients on the side, not chems.
GID00017438	Besides, it's not like drugs are a big deal. Alcohol is just as bad yet it is perfectly legal in the NCR. I'm just a businessman doing business.
GID00017439	You're one pushy son of a bitch, I'll give you that. Alright, here are some caps to keep your mouth shut.
GID00017440	There is a lot of money to be made, and I'm not afraid to share it with reliable folks. Just keep the busters out of this and we're good.
GID00017441	So you've got the package then? I need to get that sorted and then sent off in a few days.
GID00017442	Now see, that's just downright unfriendly of you. I can't just let you go shooting your mouth off to Boyd now can I?
GID00017443	Fine, piss off then. I thought we had a good thing going here, but it looks like you're just a goody-goody.
GID00017444	Your talking slows my healing process. Be snappy about it.
GID00017445	Do you ever quit? Go on.
GID00017446	He's stationed just inside the south wall of the base. Should be on patrol, if he isn't screwing around.
GID00017447	It's in the main concourse. That's the building just across the skybridge. There's a barracks area that'll be behind you on the left when you enter.
GID00017448	His stuff will be at the foot of one of the beds.
GID00017449	You're getting too close, shamus!
GID00017450	This is where your trail runs cold.
GID00017451	The tram is about to depart. Please keep clear of the doors, and restrain any young children.
GID00017452	Heh. My reputation precedes me, I see. Yeah I pulled a few pranks in my time.
GID00017453	Aw, usual stuff. Brought a brahmin upstairs in the terminal once. They can go upstairs but not down. Two heads and both of 'em dumb as stumps.
GID00017454	That got me some detention time, but it was worth it 'cause they couldn't get the brahmin back down, so it visited me a few times in my cell.
GID00017455	Dropped some firecrackers in the toilets too. That was the real bad one for me.
GID00017456	Turns out there's no way to replace the toilets now. Toilet company blew up in the War. I think they'd just have shot me if they weren't shorthanded.
GID00017457	No kidding! What'd you cook up?
GID00017458	Man, I can't wait to see the look on his face!
GID00017459	What? Like hell you are.
GID00017460	Really? That's great. I was getting so sick of this.
GID00017461	What- What are you doing?
GID00017462	Aww.
GID00017463	Sure thing. Careful, though. I'll talk your ear off.
GID00017464	Get your rifles and move out, First Recon. We've got a Fiend to kill.
GID00017465	Just needed to make the situation clear is all. How can I help you?
GID00017466	I would be happy to, should you require it. You seem to be in fine health now.
GID00017467	I would be happy to. What I can do isn't much, but I give it freely.
GID00017468	I'm afraid I have exhausted my supplies. If you come back in a day or two, I may be able to do more for you.
GID00017469	I only do what I can to help.
GID00017470	Go ahead, mock me. Nothing you say can be worse than my own shame.
GID00017471	You'd do that for a complete stranger? Thank you, friend. The army says they don't have the available manpower - as if this city is more important.
GID00017472	From what I've gathered from NCR rangers, they were most likely taken to Cottonwood Cove. You might start there.
GID00017473	I... God help me, I ran! I abandoned my family to those butchers. Not a day goes by I don't hate myself for that.
GID00017474	Oh God no! I haven't been the best father, but I didn't deserve this!
GID00017475	They are? Oh my God, thank you! Thank you so much!
GID00017476	But wait, where are they?
GID00017477	Oh, thank you! Thank you!
GID00017478	But wait, what about my wife?
GID00017479	Oh. Oh, I see. Well... thank you for saving her, at least.
GID00017480	But wait, where is she?
GID00017481	Oh. Oh, I see. Well... thank you for saving the rest, at least.
GID00017482	But wait, where are they?
GID00017483	Oh. Oh, I see. Well... thank you for saving one of them, at least.
GID00017484	But wait, where is my child?
GID00017485	Oh. Oh, I see. Well... thank you for saving my children, at least.
GID00017486	Where did they go?
GID00017487	Please, hurry!
GID00017488	Got a good memory for faces. Landmarks and such, too. Comes with practice, that's all. And a lot of scoutin' from place to place.
GID00017489	I reckon I've walked every inch of ground between Shady Sands and the Colorado... or close enough to make a man's feet plenty sore.
GID00017490	You're a fine-looking woman, no doubt about that. But I'm looking a little deeper than the skin, if you take my meaning.
GID00017491	Not so long ago, I spent more than my share of time lookin' for memorable folk like yourself. Did a lot of scoutin' around these parts.
GID00017492	Mighty pleased to meet you. Maybe I'll see you again, before we move out.
GID00017493	Always a pleasure. You keep yourself safe.
GID00017494	Well... that wasn't really a matter of choice. Got myself caught by Legionnaires, up near Malpais.
GID00017495	They had themselves some fun with me... mangled my hands and feet pretty good.
GID00017496	Wasn't much good with a pistol after that. Wasn't gonna be trekking across the waste on any more long scouts, either.
GID00017497	Caesar's boys figured I wasn't going anywhere, after what they done to me. So they didn't bother tying me up.
GID00017498	I crawled out of there on my elbows and knees. Must have looked a sight. Then I rolled down an embankment into the Colorado.
GID00017499	Guess I had a mind to drown, rather than give Caesar's boys the satisfaction of killing me.
GID00017500	But a couple Rangers happened to be watching from across the river. They jumped on in and pulled me out of there. Lucky break, they said.
GID00017501	No trouble at all. Might be nothing. Couple frisky young folks looking for a quiet place to snuggle up.
GID00017502	Then again... that light is mighty consistent. Always there at 1 AM. Might be worth a look.
GID00017503	Huh. Not good. Price works alone. Chat him up and see what's going on.
GID00017504	Don't give him any details and do not give him the package. There's a chance he actually knows Price, but I doubt it.
GID00017505	Well, it sounds like you screwed the pooch. Give me the package back.
GID00017506	Price works alone. If someone has replaced him, it's either some scumbag trying to hijack goods from his suppliers, or worse...
GID00017507	It could be someone more dangerous. You need to kill him, whoever he is.
GID00017508	Good to hear.
GID00017509	Well, I'd say you're officially invited to the big kids' table now. My stash is your stash.
GID00017510	Oh, and I think you might get more use out of this rifle than I ever will. Enjoy.
GID00017511	Get it done.
GID00017512	Well in that case, leave me to my work.
GID00017513	In the area where the gas is active, any kind of fire or explosion should do the trick. Hell, even lasers would do the job.
GID00017514	If you don't have anything like that, I've got some grenades in my bag in the corner that you can use.
GID00017515	Oh yes, I imagine there'll be quite an explosion when the gas gets set off. Fire will probably expand throughout the entire level in mere moments.
GID00017516	That does pose a problem, doesn't it?
GID00017517	If you could seal yourself inside a room before the explosion went off, you might be protected from the blast.
GID00017518	Then again, the flames will probably blow into the rooms down there. Maybe if there were a room that was reinforced...
GID00017519	Well, I'm sure you'll figure something out.
GID00017520	Yes, there'll be an explosion when the gas is ignited. But I'm sure you'll be fine. Now leave me to my work.
GID00017521	What? Do I have to figure everything out for you? Fine, let me think for a second.
GID00017522	It would be pretty funny, wouldn't it? Oh, don't look at me that way. I'm sure you'll be fine.
GID00017523	From what I've been able to determine, the scientists here managed to breed them by combining traits from two distinct plant species.
GID00017524	The resulting hybrid proved more adaptable than expected, however, and soon became a threat to humans.
GID00017525	It's sad, really. All those wonderful minds, undone by their own irresponsibility.
GID00017526	That's a very good question! Actually, I didn't come up with it. The systems were already set up to pump the gas when I first arrived here.
GID00017527	I believe the scientists were in the process of attempting to ignite the gas just as we're about to do. And by we, I mean you, of course.
GID00017528	Something prevented them from igniting the gas, obviously. I suppose it's possible that the gas triggered some kind of defensive reaction.
GID00017529	Hordes of previously slumbering creatures may have awoken and entered a killing frenzy, ripping the hapless scientists into quivering, bloody chunks.
GID00017530	You'll have to let me know when you get back from going downstairs.
GID00017531	The mantises and spore plants virtually ignored me for most of the time that I've been here.
GID00017532	It was only once I began to investigate the fifth level that my presence began to agitate them. I guess I was a little too close to home for them.
GID00017533	A few days ago, I was attacked by a large number of mantises and was knocked unconscious. When I woke up, I was in that cave.
GID00017534	The mantises seem to feed some of their prey to the plants. Fortunately for me, it appears the plants are disinclined to eat ghoul meat.
GID00017535	Are you kidding me? This place is under quarantine! We can't let a single spore get out of this place if we can help it.
GID00017536	What do you mean?
GID00017537	Ah, I should have known. Well, in that case...
GID00017538	I suppose you've given me no reason not to trust you. Fine, take the data and go. I hope you know what you're doing.
GID00017539	We needed some place to put down some roots. I was having trouble keeping my people out of Westside.
GID00017540	Go on through, soldier.
GID00017541	Go right ahead, trooper.
GID00017542	Hold it. NCR only beyond this point. Keep your distance or I will fire.
GID00017543	Sorry. No civilians on the monorail. Any closer and I am authorized to use deadly force.
GID00017544	You had your chance.
GID00017545	That's it.
GID00017546	Oh, no you don't. Time to teach you to mess with our people!
GID00017547	We saw you follow the kid in there. Figured we'd teach you a lesson.
GID00017548	[FAILED] Right. No big deal. We're going to beat the hell out of you now, but don't worry - we don't think it's a big deal, either.
GID00017549	It'll be hard for you to do anything once we break your arms and legs.
GID00017550	[SUCCEEDED] No, no, it's all right. We're just looking out for our own, you understand. We're, uh, sorry to bother you.
GID00017551	Where'd you get it from?
GID00017552	Fuck! I did too. I'm not doing well.
GID00017553	I don't know. If you can't trust dealers, who can you trust?
GID00017554	I got it from my buddy. I think he made it himself.
GID00017555	All I have is Psycho.
GID00017556	Nope, not for you at least.
GID00017557	Lying bitch.
GID00017558	Fuck, I need a fix.
GID00017559	I got some to last me a little bit I think.
GID00017560	Yeah, me too. Gonna have to go hit the boss for a fix soon.
GID00017561	I gave my last hit of Psycho to this hot little chick last night.
GID00017562	Motor-Runner told me he was going to pick up some more when the Khans come back through.
GID00017563	I can't help you.
GID00017564	You and me both.
GID00017565	Damn, I gotta find some shit.
GID00017566	Sorry. I'm moving.
GID00017567	I didn't say anything.
GID00017568	Yeah, you don't look too good.
GID00017569	Me too. I think I need a fix.
GID00017570	I don't feel right. My head is fucking with me.
GID00017571	Shit. I gotta go find something to take the edge off.
GID00017572	I'm not looking at anything.
GID00017573	I'm looking at you.
GID00017574	Get the fuck out of may way.
GID00017575	Well keep moving.
GID00017576	I try to keep my people out of Westside. Apart from trying to stay on good terms with the Khans, who do business there. There's Mean Son of A Bitch.
GID00017577	That fucking mutant is more trouble to kill than to avoid. Having someplace for my people to sleep reduces the chances of drifting into Westside.
GID00017578	Unbelievable. That man has given us so much grief since we set up here. This may be a major turning point for us.
GID00017579	I can't tell you how many times we thought we'd taken him out, only to have him show up again later, taking more heads off of fallen troopers.
GID00017580	This is for the bounty. And this is from a pool me and a lot of the soldiers around the base had going. You may not be NCR, but hey, it's only fair.
GID00017581	I'd hoped he'd be able to slip past their security and be out before anyone knew he was there.
GID00017582	But I underestimated the Fiends. Should've known better, given the hell they've caused for us.
GID00017583	Regardless, what you did for Anders isn't something he or any of us around here take lightly. We're all glad to have him back. Thank you.
GID00017584	That's probably true, but I wonder if I should've taken a different strategy entirely.
GID00017585	Although my options were certainly limited with most of our forces tied up garrisoning this place.
GID00017586	Excellent treatment. I hadn't thought of that!
GID00017587	I thought that man was done for, but you brought him around.
GID00017588	That was some fine doctoring. I could learn a thing or two from you!
GID00017589	I surely am. Well, sort of. I came out from Utah about six months back, saw a need for my help here.
GID00017590	The Followers weren't too happy about that, of course. They haven't been too fond of the NCR for a while, but I go where I'm needed.
GID00017591	I give what aid and comfort I can. I have medical knowledge thanks to my time with the Followers.
GID00017592	Well, that's an interesting question. Among the Church, I'm called Elder Gunnarsson. The Followers call me "Doc."
GID00017593	You can call me Bert, though.
GID00017594	I never was able to reach him. He has allowed drugs and hatred to consume him. He runs with the Fiends north of here, now. They call him Driver Nephi.
GID00017595	Poor lost souls, most of them. They thought to come to New Vegas and find their fortunes on its shining Strip.
GID00017596	But the journey is often long, and the price to enter the city is steep. Those who could not pay ended up here, hoping to earn the caps they need.
GID00017597	Some find honest labor, but more fritter away what little they've saved on crooked gambling and cheap liquor. Still, I minister to them as I can.
GID00017598	Following a lost cause, I'm afraid. My old friend Nephi fell in with a bad crowd.
GID00017599	Drug runners, raiders, probably worse things it's better not to dwell on. When his gang headed west, I followed.
GID00017600	I thought perhaps I could turn him back to the Church.
GID00017601	Well... that was a bit messier than I would have liked. Was there anything else?
GID00017602	Glad to hear it.
GID00017603	Hey, you asked, I answered.
GID00017604	Yeah. So what? I could take a bullet in the skull tomorrow. I haven't got time to take it slow and subtle.
GID00017605	I see somebody I like, I go ahead and tell her. That's about the only thing that the horn-dog males get right.
GID00017606	Damn shame. I've got some leave time coming to me, and I booked a suite at the Gomorrah. The two of us, rolled up in those silk sheets...
GID00017607	Trust me, the alpha males are overrated. Plenty of them in the army. All they're good for is killing each other and taking smelly shits.
GID00017608	I'm just saying... never know what you might like, if you don't give it a try.
GID00017609	We're here. First Recon, get into your positions and wait for the target.
GID00017610	Old Maude... Sometimes you can afford the creamy veal of a Sweetie, and sometimes you got just enough caps to buy a tough piece of jerky.
GID00017611	Keith's a two-bit hustler, he runs a gambling operation out of his shack. Ask me, he wins way too often to be playing fair.
GID00017612	I suspect he's running drugs, too, I just can't prove it. Maybe you can find something - talk to him, poke around his shack, something.
GID00017613	Mind cleaning up our mess, Corporal?
GID00017614	Not at all, ma'am. I'll get right on it.
GID00017615	Can't stop talking about that, can they? The Lieutenant actually sat me down and asked if I wanted to talk to a doctor.
GID00017616	Wouldn't believe me when I told him to forget it. I mean, if that slab of meat had gotten me pregnant, then maybe I'd want to talk to a doctor.
GID00017617	What kind of dumbass question is that? Of course I want payback.
GID00017618	If I get hold of that fat pile of shit, I'll shove my rifle up his ass a couple hundred times, see how he likes it.
GID00017619	Then I'll fire some shells up in there, make sure he doesn't ever forget me. He left me a bunch of souvenirs - I figure I can do the same.
GID00017620	So yeah. Payback would be good. Doesn't mean I need to have myself a big long cry.
GID00017621	Yeah. Typical. Thing is, that fat pile of shit sneaked up on us from behind and kicked little 10 in the back of the head.
GID00017622	Knocked him out cold. Probably meant to kill him. The kid had no idea what happened until he woke up in the infirmary.
GID00017623	10 wants to blame himself, I can't stop him. He'll work it through on his own.
GID00017624	Never said it was. But I don't need to talk to any doctors. Especially not the pricks around here.
GID00017625	If I was smart, I'd fake a big old breakdown. That'd make everybody happy, and I'd get some leave time.
GID00017626	But then I'd be doing what everybody wants, and being the asshole that I am, it just wouldn't feel right. Got to have some integrity.
GID00017627	What gave me away? The big gun, the shades, or the attitude?
GID00017628	Don't take this the wrong way, but girl, it's a damn good thing you're hot. That sarcasm blew right over your head, didn't it?
GID00017629	Yup. Lot of people make that connection. Big gun. Sniper. Some people don't even need to ask.
GID00017630	They don't. Only the good ones do.
GID00017631	My partner's got some potential, so I let him wear those goofy glasses. I tell him they're his training shades. He totally buys it.
GID00017632	Truth is, his eyes just suck.
GID00017633	The little guy. 10 of Spades. I like him because he listens. Doesn't shut up the rest of the time, but when I talk, he listens.
GID00017634	Also, he doesn't pull any stupid come-ons, like practically every other horn-dog alpha male on this base. Might be he's just scared of me, though.
GID00017635	Yeah. We spot for each other, watch each other's backs. Usually works pretty well, unless you get paired up with an asshole.
GID00017636	Thing is, there's a lot of assholes in the army. Now if they paired me up with somebody who looks like you...
GID00017637	Lot of downtime in the army. Nobody around but you and your partner. Plenty of time for... whatever we want.
GID00017638	Yeah. We spot for each other, watch each other's backs. Usually works pretty well, unless you get paired up with an asshole.
GID00017639	Thing is, there's a lot of assholes in the army. I keep hoping they'll pair me up with some hot blonde, like you see on those old pinups.
GID00017640	Shit, I don't even care if she can shoot straight. Can't have everything.
GID00017641	Hah! See, we've even got the same sense of humor. I like a girl who doesn't piss me off after sex.
GID00017642	Hah! You're not as dumb as I thought you'd be. We got the same sense of humor.
GID00017643	Probably better to walk away while I still like you, though. All kinds of things piss me off. Like just about anything that anybody says.
GID00017644	Yeah, right. You're sniffing up the wrong skirt. Try me again when you're tall, blonde, and female.
GID00017645	Thanks for your help with Usanagi and all, but I still like them tall, blonde, and female.
GID00017646	Not unless you count the Fiends as serious. Gorobets keeps us inside the fence, most of the time. Doesn't matter to me, I just shoot bad guys.
GID00017647	Sooner or later, they'll move us out to the Dam, though. That's when the shit gets nasty.
GID00017648	Legion fights to win. And they're smart... hell of a lot smarter than these crazy Fiends. But I don't feel bad about shooting Legion boys.
GID00017649	Fiends, on the other hand... sometimes I get some pangs of conscience. Not often. But sometimes.
GID00017650	Some cute little junkie bitch, so fucked-up she doesn't even know that she's the bad guy. And I've got to headshot her. Makes me think.
GID00017651	Might just be sex, though. I see some cute little number, and I'd rather get in her pants. So maybe I'm a stone-cold bitch, after all.
GID00017652	Yeah, doesn't sound like me at all, right? But it happens.
GID00017653	Yeah, well, we can't all be heartless shitheads, right?
GID00017654	Yeah... I always scare off the hot ones...
GID00017655	You don't have to leave, girl. Better yet, come and find me when I'm off duty.
GID00017656	Yeah. Try not to get killed.
GID00017657	Marked cards, huh? I suppose it's obvious, really. Here, you've earned this.
GID00017658	I'm going to go take Keith into custody. If you're interested in a little extra pay, I wouldn't mind the back-up.
GID00017659	Son of a bitch - I knew he was involved with drugs. Thanks - this gives me the evidence I need. Here - you've earned this.
GID00017660	I'm going to go take Keith into custody. If you're interested in a little extra pay, I wouldn't mind the back-up.
GID00017661	Drugs and crooked gambling? Can't say I'm surprised. Here, you've earned this.
GID00017662	I'm going to go take Keith into custody. If you're interested in a little extra pay, I wouldn't mind the back-up.
GID00017663	Glad to have you. Let's go. Just stick close and follow my lead. Keith's a cowardly son of a bitch, but he might try something if he's desperate.
GID00017664	Fair enough - you've done a lot already. I appreciate it.
GID00017665	[FAILED] I guess Lady Luck just smiles on me, that's all. Nothing special about it.
GID00017666	[SUCCEEDED] You know how they say you make your own luck? Let's just say I make mine with a little extra ink on the cards.
GID00017667	[FAILED] What? Are you some kind of idiot? Why, uh... why would I know that?
GID00017668	[SUCCEEDED] Oh, I getcha. Lookin for a slightly more chemical thrill?
GID00017669	Okay, I tell you what - I happen to keep some Jet around for emergencies. 35 caps and it's yours.
GID00017670	Your loss.
GID00017671	Hey, it's not like I use them all the time. Mostly I keep them in my shack until I see a really fat score roll into town.
GID00017672	And here you go. Enjoy, my friend.
GID00017673	Well, then, why are you wasting my time?
GID00017674	Well, then, why are you wasting my time?
GID00017675	Course I do. You want to meet them? Heh. Even money whether Violet's dogs rip you apart or Nephi caves in your skull with that iron of his.
GID00017676	Course I do. You want to meet them? Heh. Even money whether Violet's dogs rip you apart or Nephi caves in your skull with that iron of his.
GID00017677	And after they're done... I get to play with whatever's left.
GID00017678	That's right. Brahmin, mole rats, lizards... the occasional traveler lost in the wrong part of town.
GID00017679	Not Queenie though. I'd never cook my Queenie.
GID00017680	Who am I? I'm the scariest motherfucker you're ever gonna meet. I'm Cook-Cook, bitch, better not forget it.
GID00017681	If I had to guess, it's because I cook shit for the rest of the gang. I'm a good cook. Maybe I'll make you dinner sometime.
GID00017682	NCR? Bunch of soft little bitches, they've got no stomach for life in the wasteland. Got some choice strange, though, I'll give 'em that.
GID00017683	Heh heh... yeah. I'll give 'em *that* all right.
GID00017684	*That's* Queenie. She's the prettiest Brahmin in the Wastelands. Aren't you, Queenie, yes you are, who's a good girl?
GID00017685	If I had to guess, it's because I cook shit for the rest of the gang. I'm a good cook. Maybe I'll make you dinner sometime.
GID00017686	Goddamn right.
GID00017687	You are! Yes that's right!
GID00017688	Fuckin' A right it is. This baby's my life, my love, my strong right arm. Killed a lot of fuckers with this hunk of iron, yessir.
GID00017689	I *could.* I'm not terribly inclined to, though. If you go talk to them, they might kill you and rob me of the fun.
GID00017690	Really? Listen... you don't want to mess with Cook-Cook. And you *really* don't want to let him get you alone. Trust me.
GID00017691	Name's Nephi, friend. Driver Nephi. Pleasure to meet you.
GID00017692	Huh? Oh, lots. More than any other Fiend - hundreds, maybe. Wham, bam, "oh god, my brains, you hit me in my brains." Easy as that.
GID00017693	Bert? That scaly, corpse-looking fuck, you tell him I'm never going back to his little cult!
GID00017694	No, you fucking dolt! Why the hell would it be a pleasure?!
GID00017695	And get the fuck away from me before I cave in your skull!
GID00017696	Me and Dermot work salvage around New Vegas.
GID00017697	You got his book? Dermot, this bastard got your book! He got your book!
GID00017698	You got his book? Dermot, this bitch got your book! She got your book!
GID00017699	What you doing stealing my stuff? That ain't even mine. I mean it's mine, but it's private. Give it back!
GID00017700	Hell, don't give it back! I don't care. Just found it when we was working salvage and thought I'd save it to give to some kid if one came by.
GID00017701	We have a Khan coming through to see the boss. Don't shoot at her.
GID00017702	We have a Khan coming through to see the boss. Don't shoot at him.
GID00017703	Then there's no problem here - and no need to get nasty. How can I help you?
GID00017704	Long time, no see, Silus.
GID00017705	Lieutenant. I was just thinking about you.
GID00017706	That so?
GID00017707	I was. I was just thinking about that pretty neck of yours.
GID00017708	How sweet.
GID00017709	I was thinking about how it would look with a Legion slave collar on it.
GID00017710	I'll pass.
GID00017711	Do you know what I love about our slave collars, Lieutenant?
GID00017712	If you love them, maybe you should try one on.
GID00017713	I love how tightly they fit.
GID00017714	I train my men to make sure the slaves' flesh bulges a bit around the top and bottom. Know why?
GID00017715	It's all the rage in fashion circles.
GID00017716	Not quite. If you fit it just right, their body never gets used to the feeling of wearing it.
GID00017717	It cuts in just enough when they swallow or turn their head to remind them who they belong to.
GID00017718	And it's that constant reminder that keeps them docile.
GID00017719	In that case, maybe you'd better save the collar you were going to give me.
GID00017720	Oh? For whom?
GID00017721	For a friend of mine you're about to meet. My friend isn't very docile.
GID00017722	And who is this friend of yours?
GID00017723	You know all the rules the NCR instituted to protect enemy prisoners of war?
GID00017724	Of course.
GID00017725	My friend doesn't.
GID00017726	Oh, and Silus? If you resist at all, I'll personally blow your brains out.
GID00017727	Come on in. He's all yours. I'll be back in a bit to see how you're getting along.
GID00017728	And I'll need you to surrender your weapons before you go in. You can pick them up from the locker on your way out.
GID00017729	Whoa, easy there! You're supposed to rough him up a little, not kill him.
GID00017730	Why don't you step outside a minute? Let off some steam.
GID00017731	Nice job.
GID00017732	I think my friend doesn't like you, Silus. I don't know how much longer I can keep her under control.
GID00017733	I think my friend doesn't like you, Silus. I don't know how much longer I can keep him under control.
GID00017734	You think this'll make me talk? A beating. This the best you can do?
GID00017735	Not just any beating, Silus. A savage beating. A beating that you'll be reminded of every time you feel pain from now on.
GID00017736	When my friend's done with you, you won't have any of your teeth left. You'll be drinking your food through a straw.
GID00017737	Your ribs will never heal properly and it will hurt every time you breathe.
GID00017738	It'll be like your collars, Silus. Impossible to forget.
GID00017739	Go to hell.
GID00017740	Huh. Not the sort of wit I've come to expect from you, Silus.
GID00017741	You're getting nothing from me.
GID00017742	I'm getting entertainment. That's something. So what's it gonna be?
GID00017743	Are you going to spill your guts to me, or am I going to let my friend the maniac back in here for some play time? Silus?
GID00017744	Silent treatment, huh? Have it your way.
GID00017745	Come on back in. I think he misses you. Oh, and let me check you for weapons, one more time. For your safety as well as his.
GID00017746	All that shouting. Honestly, Silus, you get free room and board. The least you could do is be a good guest.
GID00017747	Lieutenant, this woman is an agent of the Legion on a mission to kill me.
GID00017748	Lieutenant, this man is an agent of the Legion on a mission to kill me.
GID00017749	My, we have an active imagination today, don't we?
GID00017750	Think about it! Is it worth the risk? You need what I know.
GID00017751	Well, it sounds like the two of you are becoming fast friends.
GID00017752	It'll be your head if I die, Lieutenant. You'll be disgraced.
GID00017753	You know what? I think you're right, Silus.
GID00017754	Of course I'm right.
GID00017755	Except I don't care, because it'll be worth it.
GID00017756	It'll be worth it to never have to hear you say another word, Silus.
GID00017757	Carry on.
GID00017758	Lieutenant!
GID00017759	Is something the matter, Silus? You look upset.
GID00017760	Here, maybe you'd better step out for a moment. You've upset him.
GID00017761	Your friend is a miserable fucking degenerate.
GID00017762	I don't know, I thought she seemed like a nice lady.
GID00017763	I don't know, I thought he seemed like a nice guy.
GID00017764	If we were on the other side of the river, I'd have her torn apart by dogs.
GID00017765	If we were on the other side of the river, I'd have him torn apart by dogs.
GID00017766	That's a long walk, Silus. I don't think it's gonna happen. You'd better just talk.
GID00017767	Your tactics are a joke.
GID00017768	If you don't like dealing with me, I can bring my friend back in.
GID00017769	Both of you can rot.
GID00017770	Have it your way.
GID00017771	Come on back in. I think he misses you.
GID00017772	Hey. No cause for th-that.
GID00017773	Yeah, r-right. That's Brahmin shit. Lucky for you we're on b-b-base, and I can't start trouble with civvies. How 'bout you get l-l-lost?
GID00017774	Nah... it's no p-problem. Everybody likes to have a little fun with me. Just shows they l-l-like me. You don't rib somebody you don't like.
GID00017775	Yeah. You just walk away. No fool can trump the T-t-ten of Spades!
GID00017776	Yeah, I'll s-s-see you around.
GID00017777	It was m-my fault. See... I was kn-knocked out when it happened. That b-big guy sneaked up on us. I let B-Betsy down.
GID00017778	Yeah. The LT shouldn't have b-brought that shit up. Not with civvies, anyway. Ain't right.
GID00017779	Ain't right t-talking about this, anyway.
GID00017780	No! Ha ha! More for me!
GID00017781	Heh. Good. More for me.
GID00017782	Sell? Sell?! My dogs! What part don't you get? Mine! Lucky they don't eat you alive for that!
GID00017783	Arf arf! Ha ha!
GID00017784	Hey! No feeding my dogs!
GID00017785	Some people have gone missing from the camp lately. Haven't seen any signs of violence or heard about any feuds, they just... up and left.
GID00017786	I remember hearing some of the missing folks were doing business with Dermot and Saint James - a couple of scavengers from Westside.
GID00017787	Captain Parker. I'm in charge of this camp.
GID00017788	This here's where folks go when their luck runs out. Drifters up from the Republic, locals that can't turn a dime, drunken reprobates from all around.
GID00017789	If you don't have the caps to get onto the Strip, odds are you'll end up here.
GID00017790	Let me see that... I know these names. Nephi and Cook-Cook are major players with the Fiends. Dermot and Saint James must be working with them.
GID00017791	But, this just a list of names and not evidence of a direct connection with the missing people.
GID00017792	Damn. Combined with that girl's bear you found in Saint James' room, this is enough for me to have them brought in for questioning.
GID00017793	Thank you for your help - I'll make sure those sick bastards get what's coming to them. Here, you've earned this.
GID00017794	That... I think that's her teddy bear! It's suspicious, but it doesn't tell us what happened to the refugees.
GID00017795	Damn. Combined with that ledger you found in Dermot's room, it's enough for me to have them brought in for questioning.
GID00017796	Well, I am a little short staffed. Maybe you could give me a hand.
GID00017797	Some people have gone missing from the camp lately. Haven't seen any signs of violence or heard about any feuds, they just up and vanished.
GID00017798	I've also got Keith and his gambling to deal with - I know that skunk's cheating folk out of their savings, I just can't prove it.
GID00017799	Yeah? Like what?
GID00017800	They never seemed to have much in common - that's why I didn't notice it sooner. Young folks, old folks, men, women... all disappearing.
GID00017801	I remember a family with a little blonde girl. She... never talked much, but she always carried this little stuffed teddy bear.
GID00017802	Well, you did ask if we needed help.
GID00017803	Seem to recall a lot of them did business with those scavengers over on the West Side - Dermott and Saint James.
GID00017804	Keep at it. I need to find out what happened.
GID00017805	You've got it.
GID00017806	I've been sniping since I was old enough to walk. Lot of us sharpshooters get recruited off the farms and ranches out west. Comes natural to us.
GID00017807	As for my squad - they're the best we have. My word on that. They're all hand-picked, and I won't work with anybody who isn't up to snuff.
GID00017808	10 of Spades is the greenest of the bunch, but he's a farmboy, like me. Shooting's in his blood.
GID00017809	What did you have in mind? You thinking of luring him into range of my snipers?
GID00017810	It's one hell of a risk you'd be taking. But if you're willing... we'll do everything we can to keep you alive.
GID00017811	Can we hit him? Damn straight, we can. Question is whether he kills you before we get a clear shot.
GID00017812	No, I won't risk my team in the open. They're deadly at range, but they've got no advantage hand-to-hand.
GID00017813	But if you can draw him out... get us a clean shot... we can bring him down. No problem.
GID00017814	It's a lot to ask, I know. You'd be taking most of the risk.
GID00017815	Listen. My team has a debt to settle with Nephi. We've seen too many of our boys get brained by that golf club of his.
GID00017816	You lure him out for us, and if we can score some payback... we'll all pitch in caps for a reward.
GID00017817	My team will take up positions around the old rock crushing plant. They'll wait until they see Nephi, and then they'll start shooting.
GID00017818	At that point, just keep your head down, and stay out of range of his golf club. We'll take care of the rest.
GID00017819	Your call. Even if you were one of my troopers, I wouldn't force you to take a risk like that.
GID00017820	But the offer stands. Give me the word, and I'll put my snipers in position. Otherwise, they'll stay inside the fence.
GID00017821	Goodbye.
GID00017822	Whatever you say, buddy.
GID00017823	Whatever you say, lady.
GID00017824	Yeah. You need something?
GID00017825	Really now? We had our suspicions about that man, but he's got so many shipments going so many different directions it's been hard to track
GID00017826	What exactly is his offer? Does he realize bribing a Ranger is a hanging offense?
GID00017827	[SUCCEEDED] He has himself a deal. However, If he tries to run or he continues to deal strategic assets with enemies, he's a dead man.
GID00017828	Tell Contreras to expect to see me around more often. He better have a new bit of information when I stop in or I'm reporting his ass to Boyd.
GID00017829	[SUCCEEDED] He has himself a deal. However, If he tries to run or he continues to deal strategic assets with enemies, he's a dead man.
GID00017830	Tell Contreras to expect to see me around more often. He better have a new bit of information when I stop in or I'm reporting his ass to Boyd.
GID00017831	Later.
GID00017832	Dogs? Good dogs! My dogs! Fiend dogs. Tear you up, arf arf arf! Ha ha!
GID00017833	Heh. Good shit. Psycho. Top quality. You want? Might know a guy who knows a guy.
GID00017834	Don't fuck with Fiends. Driver Nephi'll brain your skull in! Cook-Cook... don't even want to know what he'll do.
GID00017835	Who wants to know? You here for my dogs? Can't have my dogs. Here for meat? Can't have my meat. Meat's for dogs.
GID00017836	I'm Violet. Dogs are mine. Meat is mine.
GID00017837	Heh heh. Good meat, huh? Cat meat, rat meat, dog meat - maybe even *you* meat!
GID00017838	Yeah, you haven't exactly kept a low profile. That narrows our options somewhat. They're not gonna believe your accusations.
GID00017839	But you can still create an alibi for me. I could make sure people know I haven't been near the monorail all day while you're busy blowing it up.
GID00017840	It'd be better with a scapegoat, but it'll at least deflect some suspicion.
GID00017841	I really don't have time for this right now.
GID00017842	You know, hiring isn't really my department. You should talk to Ms. McLafferty about work for hire.
GID00017843	Like I said, talk to Alice McLafferty, she's in charge here.
GID00017844	The name's Hostetler - Don Hostetler. Can I help you with something?
GID00017845	I've already told you... I'm Don Hostetler.
GID00017846	Really? Well, I obviously couldn't supply enough to feed the entire camp, but I'm game. What kind of caps are we talking here?
GID00017847	Hey, that sounds good to me. No more wasted meat just laying around to rot. I can keep my stock fresh and keep the caps flowing.
GID00017848	If I get a big delivery brought in, I'll be sure to send a good chunk of it off to McCarran right away.
GID00017849	Tell Farber I'll try and have the first shipment sorted in a week or two.
GID00017850	Expanding isn't a bad idea. Maybe I could open up a small cafe restaurant with the more diverse inventory...
GID00017851	If I get a big delivery brought in, I'll be sure to send a good chunk of it off to McCarran right away.
GID00017852	Tell Farber I'll try and have the first shipment sorted in a week or two.
GID00017853	Rations do get tight from time-to-time and it would be nice to keep a regular stock of goods.
GID00017854	If I get a big delivery brought in, I'll be sure to send a good chunk of it off to McCarran right away.
GID00017855	Tell Farber I'll try and have the first shipment sorted in a week or two.
GID00017856	Bye.
GID00017857	I'll help you if I can. What are you looking for?
GID00017858	There's the medic at Camp McCarran, but I've also heard there's a civilian doctor in the northeast part of New Vegas. I don't know for sure.
GID00017859	The Crimson Caravan Company is north of here. They have just about everything you need.
GID00017860	But, if you're in the market for guns, go see the Gun Runners. They're expensive, but they have stuff no one else carries.
GID00017861	I'm a private in the NCR army, and I've been proudly serving for two years now.
GID00017862	Although, if you were asking what I'm doing right this instant, I'm patrolling the farms. It's a safe post, but a little boring.
GID00017863	I do get to take shots at marauding Molerats once in awhile, and that's always fun.
GID00017864	Same as you, I'd imagine? Although, I'm assigned to watch over these farms and keep out trespassers.
GID00017865	I do get to take shots at Molerats once in awhile, so that's always fun.
GID00017866	It's NCR-owned farmland. It produces a lot of the crops that supply McCarran and the Dam. The farmers are all civilians, though.
GID00017867	They work the farms, and in return they get a safe place to stay and clean food and water. Some of 'em aren't all that grateful, though.
GID00017868	I shouldn't have brought it up. It's not my place to spread gossip.
GID00017869	[SUCCEEDED] All right. Some of the farmers, especially Trent Bascom, claim the NCR isn't giving them the water they need to meet their crop quotas.
GID00017870	Personally, I think they're just incompetent and making excuses. The NCR ought to send them all crying back to California.
GID00017871	[FAILED] Not my place to talk. Sorry.
GID00017872	Oh, you'd better believe it. I feel sorry for the troops who are charged with keeping the Fiends from overrunning everything.
GID00017873	The Fiends are scary because they're unpredictable. One day, they'll be taking potshots at you and then running off before you can shoot back.
GID00017874	And the next day, they'll come rushing at you pumped full of drugs and not stopping until you or they are dead.
GID00017875	Current orders are to hold the line and nothing more. That's all we seem to do these days - hold the line.
GID00017876	I guess it's a tricky situation since there's a vault in Fiend territory. If the NCR went after them, they'd just hole up.
GID00017877	Pleasure doing business with you.
GID00017878	Then we ain't going nowhere.
GID00017879	I like your speed, stranger. Let me know when that's done.
GID00017880	Mercs with a brain are no good to me, stranger. Let me know when you start behaving like a real gun.
GID00017881	Glad to hear it. Let me know when they're gone.
GID00017882	I like your enthusiasm, stranger. Let me know when that's done.
GID00017883	I thought you'd be made of stronger stuff, merc. Don't prove me wrong or I'll have to find someone else with the guts to do what's right.
GID00017884	Great work. I gotta make sure this place doesn't eat itself from the inside.
GID00017885	Great work. I gotta make sure this place doesn't eat itself from the inside.
GID00017886	I take care of those who help with that. Here, you earned it.
GID00017887	That's good to hear. Can't ever be too careful with strangers around here.
GID00017888	I'm starting to think you're as undesirable around here as those strangers. Do something to change my mind, merc.
GID00017889	That's good to hear. Can't ever keep too many eyes on strangers around here.
GID00017890	I take care of those who help with that. Here, you earned it.
GID00017891	Suit yourself.
GID00017892	Nonsense! Alice's a good girl. She may be going through a hard time, but...
GID00017893	What the hell? It's none of your business. Don't bother me with this any longer.
GID00017894	What the hell? It's none of your business. Don't bother me with this any longer.
GID00017895	I don't want to talk about this, didn't you hear? Now, get lost before we run you off the hard way.
GID00017896	They won't just let anybody into the Strip, but you should be able to have a good time in Freeside itself. Just, uh, keep a close eye on your caps.
GID00017897	They're a bunch of crazies hopped up on all kind of drugs. Apparently, they're using one of the old vaults as a hideout.
GID00017898	The army should really get in there and wipe 'em all out, but I guess they've got more than enough trouble to deal with right now.
GID00017899	Their main base is right over there by the old airport - it's called Camp McCarran now. Some people like to paint 'em all as a bunch of bullies.
GID00017900	Me, I'm glad they're around. They do what they can to keep things safe and orderly.
GID00017901	Shoot.
GID00017902	All right.
GID00017903	The Crimson Caravan Company's the big dog around here. Keep following the road north and you'll eventually come across their camp.
GID00017904	I'm pretty sure they've got a doc over at Camp McCarran, but I don't know if he'll treat just anybody.
GID00017905	Let's see you try.
GID00017906	Not enough. We've been trying to put a bullet in him for a few weeks. He's strong as a brahmin bull, and he's fast.
GID00017907	Seems like he usually runs with a gang of Fiends. Uses them for cover. We haven't been able to get a clean shot at him.
GID00017908	Betsy swears she's hit him. Twice. But if she's right, it didn't seem to slow him down.
GID00017909	Pack of drugged-out killers. They're addicted to every stim, every pill, every psychoactive enema on this fucked-up earth.
GID00017910	I've got three Fiends I want dead, and I don't give a goddamn how it gets done. That sound like something that interests you?
GID00017911	Damn right I am. And I'm paying bounties.
GID00017912	Right.
GID00017913	Good. That's damn good. I figure it's about time we got lucky out here, so maybe you can snuff one of these maniacs.
GID00017914	First one calls herself Violet. God knows why - the name is the prettiest thing about her. Spends most of her time with a pack of vicious dogs.
GID00017915	Then there's Driver Nephi. He's fast and he's brutal. Killed about a dozen of my men with a goddamn driver iron. Hence his name.
GID00017916	And finally... Cook-cook. Rapist. Pyromaniac. And damn good chef, if you believe the Fiends we've captured. Probably the craziest of the lot.
GID00017917	I'm not going to feed you any bullshit. These aren't your common Vegas trash. They've all killed good NCR men, and plenty of mercs, too.
GID00017918	You go after them - any of them - you're in for a hell of a fight. So... which one is it going to be?
GID00017919	Well, I'm sorry to hear that. Only one thing concerns me right now, and that's killing the bastards that are murdering my men.
GID00017920	You want to talk to somebody in charge, I'd start with Colonel Hsu and work my way down. You'll find him in the Main Concourse.
GID00017921	But if you want to take down some psycho-crazy bastards... I'm happy to talk caps.
GID00017922	Violet it is. Wish I could give you more advice on how to bring her down, but we know less about her than the other two.
GID00017923	Just watch out for the dogs. She raises them herself. Might as well be their mother - they never leave her side.
GID00017924	You've got some guts, I'll give you that. Nephi is one tough son of a bitch. You let him get close, and he'll take your head off.
GID00017925	My advice is this. Talk to Lieutenant Gorobets. He's in charge of Alpha Team, 1st Recon. Snipers.
GID00017926	If you're lucky, you can lure Nephi into the open, and the sharpshooters can bring him down. You bring me the head, you'll still get the bounty.
GID00017927	It's a better bet than trying to take Nephi one-on-one, but it's your call.
GID00017928	One thing I should tell you about Cook-Cook. The piece of shit is pure animal. He raped one of my snipers, and that makes this personal.
GID00017929	Also... he's got a flamethrower, and he's damn good with it. From what I hear, he either rapes or burns every living thing he can get his hands on.
GID00017930	Only one man's gotten close to killing him, and that's Little Buster. So he says, anyway. Maybe it's bullshit, but I'd still ask him about it.
GID00017931	Can't say I blame you. If I wasn't in this fight for my country, you couldn't pay me enough to screw with those maniacs.
GID00017932	If you change your mind, I'll be happy to see you again. Otherwise... best to stay out of the way.
GID00017933	Good question. Fiend territory is southeast of here, but they range all over the area. None of them stays in any one place for long.
GID00017934	One more thing. If you want the full reward, you need to bring me a recognizable head. My superiors need proof they're gone.
GID00017935	That means no headshots. No decapitations 'til after they're dead. And no damage to the face. If you want to be safe, aim for the chest.
GID00017936	You bring me a head that looks like a rotten tomato, people will be doubting, and I won't be authorized to pay the entire bounty.
GID00017937	Good luck to you. And don't get careless.
GID00017938	You've gone after the Fiends before - I don't have to tell you to keep alert. Good luck.
GID00017939	Just bring me back that last head. And don't lose your own.
GID00017940	Out in the yard. Gorobets coordinates our sniper teams. He's been gunning for Nephi for weeks now.
GID00017941	Only thing he hasn't had is willing bait. Don't have enough troops to order anyone beyond the fence. Not anymore, anyway.
GID00017942	Bounty hunter. Talks big. But he's still alive, so he can't be completely full of shit.
GID00017943	I think he's out in the yard, waiting to claim a couple bounties.
GID00017944	Fair enough. You've done your part. If you change your mind, you know where to find me.
GID00017945	That's the best damn thing I've heard all day. Finally somebody around here with some goddamn ambition.
GID00017946	There's two psycho-bastards left. Which one will it be?
GID00017947	Sorry to hear that. You had my hopes up. If you change your mind, the bounties still stand... unless somebody else claims them.
GID00017948	Well... we're still better off than we were. Maybe one of my snipers will get lucky. If not, and you change your mind... you know where I'll be.
GID00017949	Oh yeah. You can order up anything you want... as long as it's corn or beans!<Laughs>
GID00017950	Just kidding. Haven't you heard? With few shipments from home and little variety, the troops are getting restless for some quality grub.
GID00017951	You can only do so much as a chef with just corn, beans, onions, and peppers.
GID00017952	Chow down.
GID00017953	Sorry, but the brass ordered me to not serve enemies of NCR.
GID00017954	I don't like your kind taking food from my men, so I'm going to charge you a little extra. Don't like it? Tough.
GID00017955	Well, we haven't had any quality meat in months. Everyone in the camp just eating beans for protein... It isn't pretty.
GID00017956	Some of my kitchen machinery is broken down, too, so we've been eating mostly raw vegetables.
GID00017957	And I'm desperate for spices or seasonings. Anything. Just something to the general mood around here.
GID00017958	Here is the list. We've been scrapping together quick-fixes to keep it running for months. I think it finally crapped out and needs a full overhaul.
GID00017959	It's the goofy machine behind the counter in the corner next to the stove. I'd be much obliged if you could take a look at it and get it fixed up.
GID00017960	I don't know. Try the various traders around the wastes, or the pawn shop in Westside might have some parts.
GID00017961	Oh, I've heard of a place called House Tools you could check out! Its an old factory on the north side of Vegas.
GID00017962	Just a word of warning, though. I hear no one who goes in there comes back out. Could be traps, crazy robots, or who knows what in that place.
GID00017963	The Crimson Caravan would probably be able to arrange a regular shipment, but I don't know of any spices known to improve mood.
GID00017964	Hell, we have a whole research department. One guy's even set up in the main terminal building. They're the ones who oughtta be looking into it.
GID00017965	Great! Small price to pay in caps for a little variety in our weekly menu.
GID00017966	Excellent! That'll save us some caps and help offload a bit of our overstock.
GID00017967	Good to hear. That should cover the majority of the supply.
GID00017968	That should help balance out our stock of food more reasonably and save us a ton of caps. Good work!
GID00017969	You managed to swing us a discount and cover the majority of the meat supply we need? Good work!
GID00017970	Good, that should help diversify things. It may be a bit gamey, but I can use it for stews and kabobs.
GID00017971	Great! What he sells might be a bit gamey, but I can use it for stews and kabobs.
GID00017972	Amazing. I thought that thing was done for. That'll help me transform what I can offer the troops.
GID00017973	I'll give you a little extra discount the next time you buy food from me. Thanks again.
GID00017974	No shit? The stuff actually does all that, huh?
GID00017975	I'll have to start testing this out immediately. This will really help keep the guys focused.
GID00017976	The brass are pissed about the trouble you've been causing. Your caps are no good here.
GID00017977	Maybe you didn't hear me the first time. No service for scumbags!
GID00017978	Hey, I heard you were able to recover Morales' corpse. In thanks, you get a discount on supplies.
GID00017979	That was a real honorable thing you done there, kid. Much appreciated.
GID00017980	Here is what is currently available.
GID00017981	With your reputation? Well, I won't say your caps are no good here... let's just say that they're... less good.
GID00017982	You know what? I believe you.
GID00017983	You're free to go. Contreras, however, won't be moving drugs ever again.
GID00017984	Whoa! Hold on a minute, buddy...
GID00017985	Whoa! Hold on a minute, honey...
GID00017986	Ah, hell!
GID00017987	Well, business is pretty light and I'd welcome the income, but I'll need a lot of caps to buy the necessary supplies.
GID00017988	200 caps would get me started.
GID00017989	Great. I'll just pick up future payments from McCarran directly when I drop off my snacks.
GID00017990	You can let McCarran know they'll have fresh snacks coming in a few days.
GID00017991	[SUCCEEDED] You drive a hard bargain, but 100 caps will do until we can get a regular deal worked out with McCarran.
GID00017992	You can let McCarran know they'll have fresh snacks coming in a few days.
GID00017993	[SUCCEEDED] Fresh food and water is worth it's weight in gold... You've got yourself a deal.
GID00017994	Let McCarran know they'll have fresh snacks coming in a few days. I'll pick up the produce at that time as well.
GID00017995	Suit yourself. I'm always open to more business.
GID00017996	Caps. This whole rotten town wants caps. Nobody does anything just because it's right.
GID00017997	Fine. You want caps? You can have all of Esteban's back pay. NCR owes me, and I don't even want the damn money.
GID00017998	Then you're not from the colonel's office? Sorry... I shouldn't have bothered you.
GID00017999	I know... I've been crying. Stupid. I'm supposed to be a soldier.
GID00018000	My husband... he's a Ranger, and he... he got murdered by a pack of Fiends. Goddamn savages laid his body out to rot.
GID00018001	The brass won't say it to me straight, but they mean to leave Esteban out there. I can see that plain.
GID00018002	No... I didn't expect nothing so soon. You're doing me a favor - I don't mean to be a pest.
GID00018003	You said you wanted the caps. If you're thinking I'm not good for the money... please, you've got to take my word.
GID00018004	They put him in a box? With a flag and all? I hope so. He'd have been proud.
GID00018005	You're too good for this rotten town. First kind thing anybody ever did for me and Esteban.
GID00018006	You ever need anything, all you need to do is ask. Thank you so much.
GID00018007	You did what you said you would, and I owe you. Just like I promised, this is Esteban's back pay. Every cap.
GID00018008	Maybe the caps are all that matter to you, but... you still did more for Esteban than his own country did. Thank you.
GID00018009	You never lost anybody, have you? Not like this. Never had to think about that person you love all alone out there, cooking in the sun like meat...
GID00018010	NCR never leaves a soldier behind. That's what the recruiters told us. Promised us. We believed them.
GID00018011	Colonel says he can't spare the men to bring Esteban back home. And the Fiends, they put all kinds of mines and traps around his body. Snipers, too.
GID00018012	So do I. But I know he won't. Ain't important enough in the scheme of things, you know? Still... thanks for listening.
GID00018013	He was out on patrol. Bunch of drugged-up Fiends attacked them.
GID00018014	Esteban laid down cover fire while the others fell back. One of the men saw him get shot. He didn't die, though, not then.
GID00018015	They tried to go back for him, but there were too many Fiends, and they had to pull out. Damn savages chased them halfway to McCarran.
GID00018016	Not your problem. Right. That's the motto in this town. Rotten people, rotten place.
GID00018017	Mister, I'd about given up hope. But you've got to be careful. I don't want anybody else dying on my account.
GID00018018	Ma'am, I'd about given up hope. But you've got to be careful. I don't want anybody else dying on my account.
GID00018019	Esteban's body is laid out between some buildings, east of the REPCONN headquarters. At least, that's what his squadmates said.
GID00018020	There's an NCR position just north of there. It's on the way. They should be able to tell you what the situation is.
GID00018021	Sorry... I'm not fit for proper conversation, not now.
GID00018022	If you find him... or if you hear any news... I'll be right here.
GID00018023	His best friend, Jackson, tried. Didn't even get permission from his CO, so it could have cost him a lot. But he never came back.
GID00018024	Ah shit, I'm guessing he got caught by the NCR. You need to kill that guy now that he's seen you.
GID00018025	Last thing we need is some investigator tracking you down. Get it done, and I think we can settle accounts, so to speak.
GID00018026	Well, I can't exactly go wandering off the base whenever I want, you know? They're already suspicious.
GID00018027	I can hear the MP's now. "Gee, Contreras, I didn't know you had so many friends in the Gun Runners." Speaking of which, guess your first stop.
GID00018028	You're just passing a little note to a man named Isaac for me. I want to know which girl he likes.
GID00018029	All right, well just find me when you want to get started.
GID00018030	Great. Let me know what he says. They're almost a straight shot north from here, up past the sharecroppers.
GID00018031	All right, all right. Just trying to make a little conversation. Shoulda known a youngin like you would be in a hurry.
GID00018032	But that's neither here nor there. These plants have gotten completely out of control. I've got a plan to deal with them, but I'll need your help.
GID00018033	Well that's a hell of a bit of luck on my part, then.
GID00018034	Looks like you got sent on the same fool's errand I did, then.
GID00018035	Good. Meet me on the second level, and I'll explain what needs to be done.
GID00018036	So you're one of those, huh? Fine, I'll give you all the money I have once we're done. Meet me on the second level, and I'll explain more.
GID00018037	Have it your way. When you change your mind, I'll be on the second level. Meet me there and I'll explain what needs to be done.
GID00018038	Time is of the essence, so I'll be brief. This place is filled with spores that are toxic to humans, and we need to get rid of them.
GID00018039	I've pumped the vault full of a highly flammable gas that, once ignited, should destroy the vast majority of the spores. There's one problem, though.
GID00018040	The gas becomes semi-inert on exposure to oxygen, meaning the gas will have to be ignited close to where it's being introduced.
GID00018041	I need you to find the vents where the gas is being pumped and ignite it. Oh, and survive the resulting blast.
GID00018042	You really have a one track mind, you know that? Anyway, listen up.
GID00018043	Of course it is. This place is under quarantine until I finish what I started. Now listen up.
GID00018044	I don't think you understand the situation. Listen up.
GID00018045	This place is now locked down under quarantine, so neither of us is leaving until the situation at hand is dealt with.
GID00018046	Good. Return to me when it's done.
GID00018047	I'd love to debate you on this, but there's no time. Now do it or don't, but stop wasting my time.
GID00018048	I set the gas to pump into the fifth level since that's where the concentration of spores was highest. I'd start looking there.
GID00018049	Typically, these vaults use circular vents in their air circulation systems. Look for a wall with two of them almost side by side.
GID00018050	There's one just around the corner outside this lab if you need an example.
GID00018051	I've managed to create a connection to the vault's backup system from here. I just have to remotely delete all the files, and we're done here.
GID00018052	What's got you so flustered? You just about scared me to death shouting like that.
GID00018053	Don't you realize what those files represent? If they get into the wrong hands, this could happen all over again.
GID00018054	Only this time, the madness won't just be confined to a musty vault. Do you really want that on your conscience? I sure as hell don't.
GID00018055	No, these people died trying to stop a monster of their own creation. Failing to complete their work would mean they died in vain.
GID00018056	And that's what I intend to do. And...
GID00018057	How do you figure that?
GID00018058	I suppose the data here could serve as a warning to other scientists. Tell them what paths of research not to follow.
GID00018059	All right. You convinced me. Take the files back to that buffoon. You make a good point, but I still honestly hope you know what you're doing.
GID00018060	No, it shouldn't take all that long. Just a few more moments and...
GID00018061	...it's done. We can rest easy.
GID00018062	...that's strange. The system says that the files were accessed recently, and copied to an external source.
GID00018063	You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?
GID00018064	I've unlocked the door so you're free to run along now. Although it pains me to say it, I wouldn't have made it out of here without your help.
GID00018065	If you're heading back toward McCarran, tell Dr. Williams that she has my thanks as well.
GID00018066	If you're in the neighborhood of Camp McCarran anytime soon, look for a Dr. Williams. She was one of the few people there I could tolerate.
GID00018067	She seemed genuinely worried when I agreed to come out here, so if you could be a dear and let her know I'm okay, I'd be most grateful.
GID00018068	Yes, that sounds like something he'd do. Well, there's nothing for it, then.
GID00018069	Those files need to be erased. Hold out your arm and I'll have it done in a flash.
GID00018070	So you're going to be stubborn about it, eh? You're sure I can't change your mind about this?
GID00018071	Then you give me no choice.
GID00018072	Glad you're thinking clearly. I was afraid to blink there for a second.
GID00018073	There, all done. That wasn't so bad, was it?
GID00018074	Indeed. This should only take a minute. Just a few more moments and...
GID00018075	It's possible. I have spent the last few days in a cave, after all.
GID00018076	For all we know, that man sent someone immediately after you to swipe the data while you posed as mantis bait.
GID00018077	Nothing to be done about it, I suppose. All we can do is delete what's here, and that's done.
GID00018078	You're pretty highstrung for a youngster. In any case, just a few more moments and...
GID00018079	Well, if they had any manners they would. In my day, if an old lady went missing for a spell, people cared.
GID00018080	Oh, they did. I've taken extensive notes of all their successful experiments. Their research won't go to waste. As for the file erasure...
GID00018081	Ah, she's such a dear. Not like that pompous little pedant she works for.
GID00018082	Okay, what do you need?
GID00018083	Okay, what do you need?
GID00018084	Okay, I'll follow you down to Motor-Runner. Here, take the key to the maintenance wing.
GID00018085	Okay, I'll follow you down to Motor-Runner. Here, take the key to the maintenance wing.
GID00018086	Crap, it looks like I may have lost it. I sure hope you have some way to get us through that door.
GID00018087	Okay, I'll follow you down to Motor-Runner. Here, take the key to the maintenance wing.
GID00018088	Okay, I'll follow you down to Motor-Runner. Here, take the key to the maintenance wing.
GID00018089	Crap, it looks like I may have lost it. I sure hope you have some way to get us through that door.
GID00018090	Really? It doesn't feel any better... but I'll take your word on it. Motor-Runner, here I come.
GID00018091	Really? I didn't think my leg was up to full speed yet, but I'll take your word on it.
GID00018092	I'll go take care of Motor-Runner.
GID00018093	Thanks for the concern, doc.
GID00018094	Roger that.
GID00018095	Okay, thanks again for the medical care doc.
GID00018096	Roger.
GID00018097	They're a bunch of degenerate, drug-addicted killers and rapists who've turned the west side of Vegas into a war zone.
GID00018098	Their leader calls himself Motor-Runner. He seems to be the only one who can still rub two brain cells together.
GID00018099	The Fiends are a bunch of raider junkie fucks who have been causing a lot of trouble in the area outside of Vegas.
GID00018100	Their leader calls himself Motor-Runner, and he seems to be the only one with a brain that isn't fully burnt out on chems.
GID00018101	The inhabitants of the Vault were simple traders. They made a good living for themselves before they were all killed by the fiends.
GID00018102	The inhabitants of the Vault were simple traders. They made a good living for themselves for a couple weeks.
GID00018103	Then they caught the Fiends attention. I don't think they set up any kind of security, stupid fucks. They all got themselves killed.
GID00018104	I was sent here to kill Motor-Runner, the leader of the Fiends.
GID00018105	The NCR hopes that killing Motor-Runner will slow down the Fiends raiding in the area, at least until a new leader comes around.
GID00018106	I was sent here to kill Motor-Runner, the leader of the Fiends.
GID00018107	The NCR hopes that killing Motor-Runner will slow down the Fiends raiding in the area, at least until a new leader comes around.
GID00018108	Like what?
GID00018109	Okay, tell me what's on your mind.
GID00018110	Roger that shit. Let's go.
GID00018111	Okay, let's get him.
GID00018112	Okay, I'll wait.
GID00018113	Okay, I'll wait.
GID00018114	I guess you probably can. You look tough enough at least. I'm not sure how long it'll take this leg to heal up.
GID00018115	Sorry, no dice. I have a job to do, and it doesn't involve cleaning up after your mess.
GID00018116	[SUCCEEDED] I guess you have a point. And I don't know how long it'll be before I'm on both feet...
GID00018117	[FAILED] It's not a matter of toughness, it's a matter of smarts. You'll just make a mess of things.
GID00018118	But if you must get yourself killed, I heard a Fiend named Daniel saying he carries keys. Maybe he has a spare to the Maintenance Wing.
GID00018119	See that you don't.
GID00018120	First sensible thing I've heard you say.
GID00018121	Be quick about it.
GID00018122	Be quick about it.
GID00018123	Alright then, take my helmet and bring it to the NCR. That should be proof enough. This doesn't make us friends though.
GID00018124	We don't offer protection services. That's not my racket. So if you find yourself dead on your way out that's your tough shit.
GID00018125	Okay, got anything else?
GID00018126	Okay, got anything else?
GID00018127	Okay, got anything else?
GID00018128	Okay, got anything else?
GID00018129	Okay, got anything else?
GID00018130	Okay, got anything else?
GID00018131	Okay then. What's your business now?
GID00018132	Thanks for doing business.
GID00018133	Okay, we got a deal. Now let's talk a price, it'll cost you 200 caps for proof of my death.
GID00018134	I'm not going to pay you squat. Now get outta my face.
GID00018135	Yeah, that sounds like an alright deal. Here take my helmet back to the NCR. This doesn't make us friends though.
GID00018136	We don't offer protection services. That's not my racket. So if you find yourself dead on your way out that's your tough shit.
GID00018137	Sorry, no deal.
GID00018138	Okay, I don't need the money that bad. 150 it is. This doesn't make us friends though.
GID00018139	We don't offer protection services. That's not my racket. So if you find yourself dead on your way out that's your tough shit.
GID00018140	We were part of a caravan heading into New Vegas from down south. They are holding us hostage, trying to get some ransom.
GID00018141	Anyone willing to pay for us died in the attack. Once the Fiends figure that out, we are as good as dead.
GID00018142	Can you set us free now?
GID00018143	Thanks partner. I think the Fiend with the key is back in one of the bedrooms somewhere, someone called him Daniel. If that helps.
GID00018144	I don't know much, only that the people who lived in here originally were killed by the Fiends. Carter there escaped and managed to explore for a bit.
GID00018145	He hacked a password off of the computer, and found the location of some guns. He was on his way to get them when the Fiends caught him again.
GID00018146	They are a bunch of junkies that do whatever they can to get money for chems.
GID00018147	I hear they are lead by a guy calling himself Motor-Runner. I think he is in one of the other wings, although I haven't seen him myself.
GID00018148	We are going to die in here. Please, if you find the key let us out. We'll find our own way to safety.
GID00018149	Smart man. I could use somebody who can operate under the radar around here.
GID00018150	Whoever our mole is, he's been slippery. Whenever one of the MP's gets too close, he changes his habits. Our last lead went cold weeks ago.
GID00018151	Christ, keep it down! You want to blow the whole thing? We've worked years for this.
GID00018152	But maybe it's good you're here. Hsu knows about the leaks, and I'm supposed to find the spy for him.
GID00018153	At first I couldn't believe my luck. But since I haven't produced results - for obvious reasons - I feel him looking at me differently now.
GID00018154	Maybe he's just thinking about putting someone else in charge, maybe he's starting to suspect. Either way it's bad for me.
GID00018155	Especially once this next part goes down.
GID00018156	Perfect. This has turned out better than I'd ever imagined.
GID00018157	This will pay dividends for the Legion for a long time to come. I was with Hsu when the bomb went off. He'll never think to investigate me for it.
GID00018158	I'll make sure Caesar himself hears about your success today. And take this, courtesy of the NCR. I'm sure they won't miss it.
GID00018159	Bye.
GID00018160	I don't know what you mean.
GID00018161	Really? And how would you know where I'm supposed to be?
GID00018162	Poor Crenshaw. He's pulled his last prank.
GID00018163	Go and tell Colonel Hsu you found the bomber. Once Hsu's convinced, we can breathe easy.
GID00018164	Is that right? No one has any business being in there after dusk. I wonder...
GID00018165	There's a lot of communications equipment up there. He could be using it to touch base with whoever sent him.
GID00018166	You've already done us a lot of good, but I'm afraid to move on this myself. We've tried catching this guy before and he can always smell a trap.
GID00018167	But he may not know about you. I need you to follow him into the tower. See if you can discover his identity. Report back and I'll have him arrested.
GID00018168	Report back when you've got it and I'll have him arrested.
GID00018169	Took me three-and-a-half years, just to make Captain. Usually takes four, but I made sure there was an early vacancy.
GID00018170	Caesar sees threats before they're even aware of him. He sent me long before we moved to occupy the eastern riverbank.
GID00018171	And now all my work, all the waiting, is about to pay off.
GID00018172	If you haven't noticed, the NCR bolsters its presence on the Strip from here. Sends troopers on the monorail in shifts.
GID00018173	The monorail lets them occupy two positions for the price of one. It's a supply line that's immune to raiders and other hindrances on the ground.
GID00018174	If someone were to cut that line, both positions would be much weaker. Fragile. They know this, and they watch it like hawks.
GID00018175	But I've been here a long time, and I've learned everything there is to know about it. And I'm going to blow up that train.
GID00018176	I told you I think they're starting to suspect me. You're going to help me cast away those suspicions.
GID00018177	You're going to put the bomb on that train.
GID00018178	I'll be sure to be in the presence of several reliable eyewitnesses when it happens. Then we're going to pin this on a scapegoat.
GID00018179	I'd planned on disappearing after this operation. It'd be a matter of time before they traced it to me. Figured out I was a frumentarius.
GID00018180	But with your help, maybe I can stay on after all. Make plans for something... grander.
GID00018181	I have the explosives stashed in a trash can next to the ticketing counter along with some incriminating documents.
GID00018182	You'll pick them up and make your way upstairs to the monorail terminal.
GID00018183	They change the guard there at 0900 and 1800 hours. There'll be a small window where there's no one guarding the train.
GID00018184	No, no. I wouldn't do that. Not unless I didn't have better options, anyway. And I do.
GID00018185	Good. Try to plant the explosives quietly if you can - you'll make both our lives easier.
GID00018186	But first things first. Go offer your services to Colonel Hsu. Tell him you'll work independently to find the leak.
GID00018187	He's running out of options. He'll accept as long as you don't give him a reason not to.
GID00018188	If he doesn't, then don't be surprised if you're the new scapegoat. So don't fuck this up.
GID00018189	Yeah, let's make sure you have it down pat.
GID00018190	Are you sure? Because I think the Legion would frown upon that decision.
GID00018191	Very well. Let me know if you should change your mind.
GID00018192	I can't let you leave.
GID00018193	What? You idiot! I spent years earning his trust. The whole point of your heading up this operation was to preserve that trust!
GID00018194	Now they'll replace him in a week with some other colonel and I'll be back to square one. You've set me back years today. Years!
GID00018195	Get the hell out of my sight.
GID00018196	Officially I'm in charge of Bravo Company. But since General Oliver has Bravo and most of our forces here garrisoned, I'm free to do other things.
GID00018197	So I work with Colonel Hsu on logistics. Patrols, supply lines, reinforcements, that sort of thing.
GID00018198	Hell of a position to be in when you're working for the other side. But I have to sabotage with a light touch, or else my guilt would be obvious.
GID00018199	Lately it's been less about that and more about figuring out how that information is getting leaked to raiders.
GID00018200	It's a big base with a lot of unhappy soldiers. They get stir-crazy. Hard to separate the malcontents from the actual culprit.
GID00018201	Well, I'll leave that to you. But I would recommend Lieutenant Boyd and Sergeant Contreras as two people who usually know what's going on around here.
GID00018202	Lupa, this is Frumentarius Picus, over.
GID00018203	Ten-four. Keep us updated.
GID00018204	Ten-four.
GID00018205	Go ahead, Picus.
GID00018206	Afternoon patrol enters Fiend territory at 1300. Have them mine that stretch.
GID00018207	That would leave them the morning to bury mines along that stretch. Over.
GID00018208	Ten-four, Picus. Fiends will be alerted.
GID00018209	Roger Lupa.
GID00018210	What's the status of your primary mission, Picus?
GID00018211	Charges are set. Detonation will occur as the train leaves the station. Over.
GID00018212	How long?
GID00018213	Couple of minutes. Over.
GID00018214	[SUCCEEDED] Sure. You got a deal.
GID00018215	[FAILED] That don't buy much these days. Double it and you've got a deal.
GID00018216	[SUCCEEDED] H-Hey... hey, don't worry, I was just kidding. We're going, right boys?
GID00018217	[FAILED] I ain't moving my stuff just 'cause you ask, nicely or not. Get the fuck out of my sight, punk.
GID00018218	Fuck you, asshole! You're gonna regret it!
GID00018219	Oh really? And how are you gonna make us?
GID00018220	Sure. Fire away.
GID00018221	Doctor Usanagi runs a medical clinic up the road.
GID00018222	I think there a few places, but I've heard that the Gun Runners sell the best.
GID00018223	All right, then.
GID00018224	There's a few independent ones like me, but it's mostly the big trading outfits that deal in water, like the Crimson Caravan Company.
GID00018225	Hmm... perhaps not, then.
GID00018226	I know of only the one other. Though I wouldn't be surprised if there were a great many.
GID00018227	Good. But for her to trust you to re-enter the room, she'll need to believe you've been doing what she expects of you.
GID00018228	You'll need to punch me until I'm bleeding and weak. Go on. This is nothing compared to the Legion's training.
GID00018229	Very well.
GID00018230	I don't know why I'm taking this chance on an invalid... I'll explain again.
GID00018231	[?] Foot soldiers of the Legion are trained to not have to think for themselves - to have conflict removed from their minds.
GID00018232	They kill themselves to evade capture because they are not trusted to make such a decision rationally in the heat of battle.
GID00018233	But I'm no foot soldier. I knew I could escape captivity on my own, without revealing the tiniest iota of information to my captors.
GID00018234	[SUCCEEDED] I'll show you gutless, you sniveling bastard. I'll spill your guts all over this room!
GID00018235	[?] I've told them nothing. They've gotten nowhere. I'm a centurion, for Christ's sake. I deserve his trust.
GID00018236	[?] You have to let this go. I'll disappear. No one will ever see me again. That was always the plan in the first place.
GID00018237	[SUCCEEDED] No! That's not what I meant! I-
GID00018238	Lieutenant! This man is trying to kill me! He's not who you think he is!
GID00018239	[SUCCEEDED] No! That's not what I meant! I-
GID00018240	Lieutenant! This woman is trying to kill me! She's not who you think she is!
GID00018241	[?] You think I could get where I was in the Legion army if I feared death?
GID00018242	[?] Coward? I've faced odds that would make your NCR soldiers wet themselves.
GID00018243	I've led charges against men with guns carrying only my knife, and I can tell you, it was they who feared me.
GID00018244	But suicide is a weak death on a battlefield. It says to your enemy that you fear capture. It says if you're caught you can be broken.
GID00018245	Take your time.
GID00018246	[?] You've made your intentions clear. The Legion has abandoned me.
GID00018247	[?] If I had killed myself then I would've been murdering one of Caesar's greatest soldiers. Either choice is a betrayal of the Legion, as I see it.
GID00018248	[SUCCEEDED] I've done everything Caesar ever asked of me, and this is how I am repaid? With assassination?
GID00018249	I ambushed countless NCR patrols and wiped them out so that our operatives could move freely.
GID00018250	I waited for him to dispatch us for three days, never questioning why the "headaches" he complained of would hinder his ability to command.
GID00018251	It'll take more than that to get me to talk, worm.
GID00018252	What? What do you mean?
GID00018253	Something is wrong with Caesar. Something he is attempting to hide from his men. But it was obvious before we set out on this last mission.
GID00018254	For three days, we awaited his order to dispatch us. Three days. But he hid in his tent, refusing to give orders. Complaining of headaches.
GID00018255	He looks different now than he used to. His face is sunken, sickly. But any questioning of his health enrages him.
GID00018256	Cedo nulli.
GID00018257	No! You slimy bastard!
GID00018258	No! You cursed bitch!
GID00018259	Nothing I've said will change the outcome for you. No force can hold back the tide of the Legion. This camp and everyone in it will burn.
GID00018260	[SUCCEEDED] You think I'm going to slit my throat for some megalomaniacal self-appointed dictator?
GID00018261	I didn't work my way up to have it all be taken from me out of some irrational paranoia. Caesar's losing it. I believe that.
GID00018262	He's been shutting himself in his tent. Privately, he complains of headaches. Whatever it is, it's affecting his ability to lead.
GID00018263	I hope the Legion burns your wretched body at the stake when they conquer this place.
GID00018264	Nothing I could tell you would do anything to stop that.
GID00018265	I don't know. I know he sends intelligence by radio in the middle of the night. Sometimes that intelligence would find its way to my century.
GID00018266	Then you're a fool. That man reports to Caesar on what I do here. The Legion isn't going to take me back.
GID00018267	My only hope is to escape and disappear. But if I escape and he reports it, they'll hunt me down as long as I live.
GID00018268	It'd serve me to report him as much as it'd serve you.
GID00018269	Beat me all you like, but it won't make my information any more useful. You can take what I have or leave it.
GID00018270	There is one other thing that may interest you. I know that Caesar has planted a spy here.
GID00018271	Every night details of NCR troop movements are broadcast from a radio on this base to Caesar's camp.
GID00018272	The spy has been here a long time - since before the entire conflict began. He's an officer.
GID00018273	If I knew who he was, I would tell you. If I escape and he's alive to report it, the Legion would hunt me down.
GID00018274	But like I said, none of this information will change the outcome for you. No force can hold back the tide of the Legion.
GID00018275	Good! Give it to me.
GID00018276	I'm going to pretend to be unconscious. Let them send you out so no one suspects you.
GID00018277	When I'm alone with a guard, I'll shoot him and leave in his uniform.
GID00018278	Hurry!
GID00018279	We work together. I'm handling his deliveries for the moment while he handles a business opportunity that came up.
GID00018280	What? Look, do you have something to drop off or not?
GID00018281	Crazy wastelander.
GID00018282	Lets see here...
GID00018283	Congratulations, you're under arrest for chem trafficking. Hand over your weapons and come with me.
GID00018284	Contreras will still get his. Killing you will just save me some paperwork.
GID00018285	Great. Let him know we'll be keeping an eye on him. He is free to do business...
GID00018286	But, if he isn't regularly reporting on illegal transactions, he's a dead man.
GID00018287	Contreras, eh? We suspected he was involved somehow.
GID00018288	It looks like you just gave me the evidence I've been looking for.
GID00018289	Good. Saves me paperwork.
GID00018290	Ranger Keller. I've been undercover for months tracking chems in this area.
GID00018291	This has to be the easiest catch yet.
GID00018292	Heh, an accomplice afterall. Well, it'll save me some paperwork just killing you.
GID00018293	You know what? I believe you.
GID00018294	You're free to go. Contreras, however, won't be moving drugs ever again.
GID00018295	[SUCCEEDED] What?! How the hell did you figure that out?
GID00018296	[FAILED] Password? That little bastard said nothing about a password.
GID00018297	Price is in NCR custody and you're going to join him, unless you've got a damn good explanation for why you're looking for him.
GID00018298	Hand over your weapons. You're under arrest.
GID00018299	Hell. Thought I'd done a better job than that. Well, if that's how it is, you can call me Ranger Keller.
GID00018300	Price is in deep with the NCR for supplying drug ingredients to the local gangs. He's currently being held for questioning.
GID00018301	What is your business with Price?
GID00018302	[SUCCEEDED] It might work since he's acting as a major hub for this activity. It's not like he has much choice now that we have evidence.
GID00018303	If you can convince Contreras to work with the Rangers to break up the drug ring, I'll call off the firing squad.
GID00018304	Just report back to me when he's agreed to make the deal. Otherwise, he's dead.
GID00018305	[SUCCEEDED] I wouldn't normally do this, but seeing so much money change hands between scumbags on a daily basis has me thinking.
GID00018306	I'm never going to be able to track all of these bastards down without some help, and Contreras seems to be a central hub of activity.
GID00018307	Tell Contreras I'm willing to put in a good report with the brass if he cooperates. Just give me a cut of the action and report any major moves.
GID00018308	[FAILED] You don't bribe a Ranger. You had better have something compelling to say, or you can join Contreras in hell.
GID00018309	[SUCCEEDED] All right, if you hear anything, report it to myself or Lt. Boyd immediately. We need to track down his source.
GID00018310	[FAILED] <Takes Contreras' package> Bullshit, lets see what you've got here...
GID00018311	Well, it looks like you've got the materials here to make chems. You're under arrest unless you've got a damn good explanation.
GID00018312	He'll be shot. We have no tolerance for chem dealers in the military.
GID00018313	Stay out of trouble.
GID00018314	I have Contreras. No one is going to miss you.
GID00018315	I wouldn't normally do this, but seeing so much money change hands between scumbags on a daily basis has me thinking.
GID00018316	I'm never going to be able to track all of these bastards down without some help, and Contreras seems to be a central hub of activity.
GID00018317	Tell Contreras I'm willing to put in a good report with the brass if he cooperates. Just give me a cut of the action and report any major moves.
GID00018318	Otherwise, he'll be reported as a traitor selling contraband to the enemy and go in front of a firing squad.
GID00018319	You really don't know what you just got yourself into, girlie.
GID00018320	You really don't know what you just got yourself into, boy.
GID00018321	Let's see... Well, it looks like you've got the materials here to make full-blown chems.
GID00018322	[SUCCEEDED] All right, if you hear anything, report it to myself or Lt. Boyd immediately. We need to track down his source.
GID00018323	[FAILED] What's that you're carrying? Looks like some kind of delivery to me...
GID00018324	Ah shit. Well, please tell me you didn't hand him the package.
GID00018325	Now you're just going to have to take him out. I can't afford having NCR knowing about my side business...
GID00018326	...and I don't think you want to go in front of a firing squad either. You take care of this, my entire stock is available to you.
GID00018327	Hell, I might even throw in something extra to sweeten the deal.
GID00018328	[SUCCEEDED] That might just work. Tell him I'll cut him in on a bit of the profit and help him track down drug dealers if he'll give me a pass.
GID00018329	The last thing I need is a do-gooder Ranger trying to take me down.
GID00018330	[FAILED] No deals. I want that son of a bitch dead.
GID00018331	Thank God. You're going to need to take him out.
GID00018332	If McCarran hears I've been selling contraband, we're both dead.
GID00018333	[SUCCEEDED] All right, here's a little something in advance. Now get the job done.
GID00018334	[FAILED] You've got brass balls, but no deal. I'm already offering you access to my stash if you take care of this.
GID00018335	Good to hear.
GID00018336	Great. The Crimson Caravan has something ready for me.
GID00018337	Look for Blake and let him know you're picking up Contreras' medical supplies.
GID00018338	Thanks. Don't come back until you have it. Crimson Caravan is just northeast of the Gun Runners. Blake's usually in the main office.
GID00018339	You bribed a Ranger? Ha! That's gotta be some kind of special talent.
GID00018340	Take your pick.
GID00018341	You need to clean up your reputation or you're going to get me in trouble - I'll have to charge you more to keep from arousing suspicion.
GID00018342	That might just work. Tell him I'll cut him in on a bit of the profit and help him track down drug dealers if he'll give me a pass.
GID00018343	The last thing I need is a do-gooder Ranger trying to take me down.
GID00018344	No way. I'm making too much money to just hand him the entire contraband operation. Just kill the bastard.
GID00018345	Don't come back until his corpse is rotting in the sunlight. The last thing I need is a do-gooder Ranger trying to take me down.
GID00018346	Very professional. I like that. Maybe you can handle something bigger.
GID00018347	Good to hear.
GID00018348	You're right. I'm just an under-the-table arms dealer. What could I possibly offer you, a drifting mercenary? Sorry for wasting your time.
GID00018349	Keely's brilliant... an absolute genius. She plays at being mean, but it's all a front.
GID00018350	When you've lived as long as she has, you get defensive around new people. Who wants to make a friend when you know you'll outlive them?
GID00018351	It's foul, to tell the truth. Most people try to get what they can from the outside... even if it's just a smuggled candy bar, now and then.
GID00018352	Contreras is a genius, he can find almost anything you'd want. Takes caps to get him motivated, though. He won't do a thing for free.
GID00018353	The Director? He's... very well-spoken. And... knowledgeable.
GID00018354	My father used say good things about them, but that was years ago... back when they'd teach farmers and ranchers about crop rotation and the like.
GID00018355	Nowadays... they've changed. They're doing what they can to discredit the NCR, give us a bad name with the locals.
GID00018356	Dr. Hildern trained with them, years ago. Not me, though. I'm an OSI girl.
GID00018357	Head researcher. Mostly on the Dam project, but I help out on other things, when they need me. Got to be flexible.
GID00018358	Right. Stay safe.
GID00018359	I couldn't get her to say. But she talked about the war - the great war, when the bombs fell - like she'd been there.
GID00018360	So I'm guessing... pretty old. Two hundred years? Maybe more.
GID00018361	[FAILED] Wouldn't be right for me to say. He's my boss... and he took a chance, bringing me out here as lead researcher.
GID00018362	[SUCCEEDED] He's not what you'd call... warm. Unless he wants something from you. And even then, it's kind of a cold warm.
GID00018363	Most of the time, I focus on the science and try to forget him. He doesn't get mixed up in any actual work. Though he tells people that he does.
GID00018364	He sure does. Everyone knows it. I've just got to endure this job until the project is finished.
GID00018365	But abandoning Keely... he crossed a line. Taking credit for other people's work is one thing. Sending people to die in the waste is another.
GID00018366	If Hildern tries to recruit any more mercs, I'm going to warn them. What can he do to me? I'm the only one who can run this lab.
GID00018367	Dead? But that's... terrible. You're sure? You saw her body? With the way she looks, maybe she just seemed dead, and she really wasn't...
GID00018368	No... you've seen enough death to know the difference. I didn't mean to sound ungrateful. I know you tried.
GID00018369	The notes count for something. I'll keep them safe. Keely's work in the vault won't be lost, and it won't be forgotten.
GID00018370	Like a brahmin and a deathclaw. Though I'm not sure which would be which. Bad analogy, maybe - they're both deathclaws, in their way.
GID00018371	Keely hates Hildern. She says he's more politician than scientist, and gets in the way of true discovery.
GID00018372	And Hildern hates Keely because... well, because every time they meet, she makes him look like an ass. In front of important people, usually.
GID00018373	Dead? But that's... terrible. You're sure? You saw her body? With the way she looks, maybe she just seemed dead, and she really wasn't...
GID00018374	No... you've seen enough death to know the difference. I didn't mean to sound ungrateful. I know you tried.
GID00018375	Keely was brilliant... she'd seen so much. What a horrible waste...
GID00018376	[SUCCEEDED] She is? But she didn't call in. Keely wouldn't waste a chance to yell at Dr. Hildern.
GID00018377	But if she's caught up in her notes... I guess she might have forgotten.
GID00018378	Sorry. I shouldn't question your word. If you say Keely's safe, I owe you these caps.
GID00018379	Thanks again. Really. I owe you.
GID00018380	[FAILED] No. That can't be right. Keely would've called in.
GID00018381	Maybe you think you helped her... I don't know. But I need to hear from Keely. Personally.
GID00018382	Otherwise... no reward. Not a cap.
GID00018383	From Alice? I'll see that she's paid right away.
GID00018384	Crimson Caravan runs a tight operation, even out here in the waste. Wouldn't do to keep them waiting.
GID00018385	Was there anything else? Or were you just here about the invoice?
GID00018386	Was there anything else? Or were you just here about the invoice?
GID00018387	From Alice? I'll see that she's paid right away.
GID00018388	Crimson Caravan runs a tight operation, even out here in the waste. Wouldn't do to keep them waiting.
GID00018389	Was there anything else? Or were you just here about the invoice?
GID00018390	Fine. I'll see that she's paid. Crimson Caravan always fulfils their contractual obligations to the letter.
GID00018391	Now I assume there's nothing more, so I trust you can see yourself to the door.
GID00018392	Dammit. Now you've made me forget what I was doing...
GID00018393	You were warned! Time to die.
GID00018394	Yeah - fuck off, and be grateful you're still breathing!
GID00018395	Final warning, asshole. Get the fuck out of here or we are going to waste your ass.
GID00018396	All right, asshole, you just fucked yourself!
GID00018397	[FAILED] Who the fuck you trying to kid? You're lucky if I let you walk away from this, asshole.
GID00018398	[SUCCEEDED] If you're fucking carrying, just fucking say so. Yeah, deliver to the boss, business as usual.
GID00018399	Motor-Runner's down in the Maintenance Wing. Straight through the door behind me, down the hall, down the stairs to the right.
GID00018400	Hey! No need, no need! I was just kidding!
GID00018401	Motor-Runner's down in the Maintenance Wing. Straight through the door behind me, down the hall, down the stairs to the right.
GID00018402	I was just kidding about tossing me some Psycho. So you don't got to say anything about that.
GID00018403	Then what the fuck are you doing here? You looking to get killed? What the fuck?
GID00018404	I'm paying 20 caps each for Jet, Psycho, or Buffout.
GID00018405	Deal is still the same, 20 caps each for jet, psycho, or buffout.
GID00018406	Okay, our deal was Jet, Psycho, or Buffout for 22 caps a pop.
GID00018407	[FAILED] Then I think you'd better find your way out before you get yourself hurt.
GID00018408	[SUCCEEDED] I guess it isn't a secret. Yeah, the residents of the Vault are all dead. We killed them.
GID00018409	Funny thing is, they just let us in. We didn't have to force the doors or anything.
GID00018410	Nice doing business with you.
GID00018411	You? Take care of me? Ha! You don't look half-tough enough.
GID00018412	Then get the fuck out. I'm a busy man.
GID00018413	Cool. I haven't had a good fight in a while, and it's been ages since Donnie and Marie had something they could sink their teeth into!
GID00018414	Sounds good to me, and to the dogs, too! Dinnertime, boys!
GID00018415	Okay, got anything else?
GID00018416	Okay, got anything else?
GID00018417	Okay, got anything else?
GID00018418	Okay, got anything else?
GID00018419	Okay, got anything else?
GID00018420	Okay, got anything else?
GID00018421	[SUCCEEDED] Alright, 22 caps each, but that's it.
GID00018422	[FAILED] These are my prices. I don't negotiate.
GID00018423	I'm not here to talk. I'm here for business. Either do some or get the fuck out.
GID00018424	What kind of arrangement did you have in mind?
GID00018425	Well now, I guess that depends on who's paying.
GID00018426	Jules, myself, and a few others patrol the streets and sewers. Any punks come up out of the rest of the city, we give 'em the run off.
GID00018427	Like I told you, we look out for each other here. Me, Jules, and a few others make sure any trouble stays the hell out of our streets.
GID00018428	[FAILED] Really? You'll forgive me if I ask you to back that claim up, won't you?
GID00018429	[SUCCEEDED] That's the kind of stuff I like to hear, stranger. All right, we could use someone like you.
GID00018430	Folks that don't belong. Murderers, rapists, extortionists, and everything in between.
GID00018431	You know, business as usual in North Vegas, stranger.
GID00018432	NCR... did you just crawl out from under a rock? Those folks only care about their business, their people and their pockets.
GID00018433	NCR's order? Don't make me laugh, stranger. We work this land, we own these streets, and we yank up the bad weeds ourselves, got it?
GID00018434	Suit yourself.
GID00018435	[FAILED] Hmm. Honesty's a good trait, stranger, but I don't deal with mercenaries unless I'm damn sure they can be trusted.
GID00018436	[SUCCEEDED] Spoken like a true mercenary. Well, you seem like you can handle yourself, stranger, and we can use people like that.
GID00018437	We may not squander our wealth like those fools in the Strip, but we take care of our own business. Consider this a token of good faith.
GID00018438	This? The OSI lab. We don't get many visitors. The smell puts people off, I think.
GID00018439	Nobody ever said science would smell clean and fresh. Anyway, you get used to it, if you give it some time.
GID00018440	I know I don't sound the part. Get raised by brahmin ranchers, and you never lose the twang. Drives Hildern crazy.
GID00018441	But I know every inch of the power grid from Hoover Dam to Shady Sands. That's what we do here - try to optimize the power output from the Dam.
GID00018442	Some of the others are working on an agricultural project, but... truth be told, they aren't making much progress. Not yet, anyway.
GID00018443	Head researcher. Mostly on the Dam project, but I help out on other things, when they need me. Got to be flexible.
GID00018444	You mean... give you work? No, that'd be up to the administrator. Hildern. He's back there in his office.
GID00018445	Between you and me, I don't think he ever leaves. Plenty of mercs go in to see him, though.
GID00018446	I can't say. We're not supposed to talk about the research. Not the details. If you're interested, I'm sure he'd see you.
GID00018447	Nice to meet you. If you need anything, I'm almost always in the lab.
GID00018448	I shouldn't say anything, I know that. But you're not the first person Hildern's sent out to the vault.
GID00018449	There were a lot of mercs. One after another. None of them came back.
GID00018450	Then, about a week ago, there was a scientist. Keely. She's unusual, not the sort of person you'd expect, but she's an absolute genius, and...
GID00018451	And he didn't mention her? Not even her name? Or any of the other mercs?
GID00018452	Not interested. More concerned. It's just... you're not the first person he's sent to Vault 22. And I know he'd never tell you.
GID00018453	We shouldn't even be talking about this, I know. But I think someone should tell you. You're not the first one he's sent to Vault 22.
GID00018454	But now he's hired you. Which means one of two things. Either he heard back from Keely, and she failed, or he's given up on her.
GID00018455	Listen. I make a fair wage, but I'm not rich, not by any means. Maybe my kind of money wouldn't appeal to your average merc.
GID00018456	But I'm willing to pay you, if you'll find Keely and make sure she's safe. Isn't right leaving her out there, no idea if she's alive or dead.
GID00018457	I had a good feeling about you. Moment you walked in. I mean it.
GID00018458	No, wait! I don't mean to see any harm come to Dr. Hildern. Unless by "talk" you just mean... talk.
GID00018459	No, I knew the danger wouldn't. I'm not trying to scare you off the job.
GID00018460	That's all I ask. She might even be able to help you. As long as you don't speak too well of Dr. Hildern.
GID00018461	I know it's not your business to fend for anyone but yourself. If not for her, do it for the caps. That's all I'm asking.
GID00018462	Of course. Anything.
GID00018463	Right. Good luck.
GID00018464	Intruder Alert! Activating Defenses!
GID00018465	Sure thing!
GID00018466	Anything else I can do for you?
GID00018467	See you later!
GID00018468	I don't know him very well, myself. I seem to remember that he was the man to call on if you needed someone to get in and get out quietly.
GID00018469	Colonel Hsu would really be the person to talk to.
GID00018470	Maybe break-in isn't the right word. We didn't find signs of forced entry. But I've had reports of someone sneaking into the control tower at night.
GID00018471	It's probably just a meeting spot for a steamy military base love affair. <Sighs> Kids today.
GID00018472	But it bothers me that they didn't break in. It means they have an access code. Most soldiers around the base don't have that.
GID00018473	Well, there's Anders. He's a Ranger. That one's not suspicious so much as worrisome - he left on a dangerous assignment.
GID00018474	Colonel Hsu sent him out. Now I think he feels guilty not having any way to check up on him.
GID00018475	Yeah. We keep coming up short on our weekly supply inventory checks. Guns and ammo, mostly. Not the kind of things you like to see go missing.
GID00018476	No witnesses yet. I've got my money on Sergeant Contreras, who's supposed to be in charge of distribution, the little weasel.
GID00018477	But he's too slick to let anyone catch him doing it. We've searched his possessions a dozen times. Nothing.
GID00018478	Suit yourself.
GID00018479	Good. The more guns you can recover, the more I'll be able to use to shoot Contreras for being inept.
GID00018480	I like the way you think. Have I said that yet?
GID00018481	Problem is that the NCR frowns on using that sort of tactic. There are some restrictions still in place from President Tandi's administration.
GID00018482	But here's my favorite thing about you - you're not in the NCR. Plus, for all this guy knows, you're completely insane. That's a winning combination.
GID00018483	Don't have anything like that. Sounds nice. Like the kind of thing I'd want to take home and use on my husband.
GID00018484	But even if we did, I don't know that I'd be comfortable using it. If there's any risk of overdose, it's not worth it. Asshole's too valuable.
GID00018485	Yes, and one time I thought I saw a tear when I told him his uniform was unflattering. But I think he just got some dust in his eye.
GID00018486	That's the spirit. Okay, I'll go in and have a word with him. Then I'll call you in.
GID00018487	You sure? You're missing out. Well, you're always welcome, if you should change your mind.
GID00018488	Word around the base is he'd been going regularly to visit a hooker named Dazzle at Gomorrah. That's a casino on the Strip. Classy place.
GID00018489	His belongings are up in the barracks in the concourse building. First bunk on your left if you're facing in from the center.
GID00018490	I haven't had a chance to look through his things yet, so that might be a good place to begin.
GID00018491	Caesar's eyes truly are everywhere. And here I thought they'd send assassins instead. Did the officer send you?
GID00018492	[?] You're nothing. You're some inept mercenary the NCR is paying to supplement its own incompetent soldiers.
GID00018493	[?] What? No! Listen, Caesar's secrets are safe with me. I stayed alive because Caesar would've wanted it. I'm useless to him dead.
GID00018494	[?] You must have some reason to be in your line of work. Tell me, what did the Legion do to you?
GID00018495	Did we enslave your children? Slaughter your family before your eyes to teach you a lesson?
GID00018496	Whatever it was, I hope I was there to give the order.
GID00018497	[FAILED] I must admit that a conversation with an imbecile may be far worse than the kind of torture I was anticipating.
GID00018498	But somehow I think I'll manage.
GID00018499	Of course, of course. All you had to do was ask. I'll tell you everything I know.
GID00018500	Let's see. I know that you're a brainless cretin. I know that you're wasting your time. I know the lieutenant is going to be disappointed in you.
GID00018501	And I know that by this time next month the streets of New Vegas will be decorated with the decaying heads of NCR soldiers.
GID00018502	Is there anything else you wanted to know?
GID00018503	I can take anything you've got.
GID00018504	I don't know what name he goes by here. But I saw him when they brought me in, and I recognized him.
GID00018505	When I saw him last it was ages ago. He was training to be an agent of Caesar's frumentarii. Apparently he passed the trials.
GID00018506	And what a job he's done, to achieve such a rank. I have no doubt he'll deliver a crippling blow to the NCR while he's here. Perhaps many.
GID00018507	I have heard that he has been radioing high-level NCR intelligence back to Caesar's camp virtually every night.
GID00018508	But never mind that now. We don't have much time. If you can get me a weapon, the rest will be easy.
GID00018509	In the hall outside, they still have my possessions in a locker. There's a gun in there that should be small enough to get past the lieutenant.
GID00018510	When she comes back, I want you to go and get it for me. Simple enough?
GID00018511	See, you're practically stealing caps from me, this work is so easy.
GID00018512	There's one more job. It's a little more complicated, but I think you're up to it.
GID00018513	I need to get some stuff sorted around. Gonna take me a day or two, so just stop back in a few days.
GID00018514	Well, I'm not. Come back tomorrow and the stuff will be ready to transport.
GID00018515	All right, I need you to pass something off to a merchant. The guy's name is Price. The exchange goes down at Miguel's Pawn Shop in Westside.
GID00018516	This next bit is very important. He's paranoid. Maybe a little schizo. You have to identify yourself with a passcode or he'll shoot you right there.
GID00018517	Just tell him you're looking for some betting advice. Then he'll say the surest move is to bet on the house.
GID00018518	Be sure you do.
GID00018519	If you get this last job done, full access to my stash. At a discount, even. Just because I like you.
GID00018520	Get moving, watch out for raiders, and do not lose that package. Good Luck.
GID00018521	To be frank, I have no idea. I leave the fighting to Colonel Hsu, and I expect him to leave the science to me.
GID00018522	Too many people have opinions on things they know nothing about. And the more ignorant they are, the more opinions they have.
GID00018523	Keely. Again. Do you... do you understand what that rotting old bitch has done?! Thousands of people, mass starvation. We had a chance to avoid that.
GID00018524	And I had a chance to prove that scientists could be more than a bunch of useless idealists. But Keely doesn't give a goddamn about that, does she?
GID00018525	You're an accomplice in this. Keely is one old woman - you could have easily stopped her. You're either incompetent, or you were on her side.
GID00018526	Now get out of this office. Get out!
GID00018527	If you're unhappy with the terms of our agreement, then consider this an object lesson.
GID00018528	In the future, I'm sure you'll consider your agreements and contracts more carefully. Now, here is the sum we agreed to.
GID00018529	Best of luck to you. Not that you'll need it. You seem like a reasonably competent person...
GID00018530	Williams has a tendency to feel before she thinks. Not in the lab. But everywhere else.
GID00018531	That might be forgivable if she kept her concerns to herself. But she doesn't. Not in front of her peers, not even with contractors like yourself.
GID00018532	That kind of behavior can undermine morale. She convinced my last contractor to quit. Same way she tried with you.
GID00018533	Probably didn't tell you that, did she?
GID00018534	No, I... no. The OSI hasn't been around for very long. I received my training elsewhere.
GID00018535	Before the bombs, I might have studied at any number of colleges, universities. They gave a man a chance to advance himself... or so I've heard.
GID00018536	But after the bombs - until a few years ago - anyone with half a brain had one choice. The Followers of the Apocalypse.
GID00018537	Didn't matter if you agreed with them or not. You either played along or you were turned away.
GID00018538	Knowledge for knowledge sake. A society of equals. They purport to be intelligent people, and then they spout this old-world dogma.
GID00018539	[SUCCEEDED] Exactly right. Imagine what the Followers could have accomplished if they were properly motivated... if they had a unified purpose!
GID00018540	Those of us who founded the OSI... we wanted to put our knowledge to work. And we have, to some degree.
GID00018541	But the execs at OSI Central... they're still bound to the old ideas. Society of equals, and all that. There's still too little direction.
GID00018542	If I can make real breakthroughs here... show the President what can be done when junior researchers are kept in line... kept focused on task...
GID00018543	Who knows. Maybe I'll be sitting in OSI Central, in a few years time. And there'll be no more coddling of "free spirits" like our friend, Williams.
GID00018544	[FAILED] That was years ago. No point in discussing it. We have more practical concerns... and more important things to talk about.
GID00018545	Destroyed. Really. I find that hard to believe. More likely, you failed to locate the proper server.
GID00018546	We? We?! You were a part of this? After we made an explicit agreement, you have the fucking gall to destroy priceless scientific data?
GID00018547	The authorities are going to hear about this. They're going to know your name, they're going to know your goddamn face.
GID00018548	Keely. It was Keely, wasn't it? Who else would fail to give a fuck that thousands of people are going to starve, without that data?
GID00018549	And for what? So Keely can wage her selfish little war against me and the OSI.
GID00018550	If the data's intact, you'll get your reward. I gave my word. I'm not the kind of wasteland savage you're used to dealing with.
GID00018551	I'm sorry you feel that way. But we both came out ahead, so... no harm done, I hope.
GID00018552	I don't see how that's relevant. The dangers of the Vault were your business, not mine. The only question is whether the data is still intact.
GID00018553	Was it? I'm sure I made it very clear... the hazards of the job were your business, not mine. The important question is whether this data is intact.
GID00018554	Williams is an admirable researcher. If she wasn't, I'd have terminated her contract, and she'd be begging for work from my former employers.
GID00018555	Okay, but make it quick.
GID00018556	Tell me why I should tell you anything. I don't know you.
GID00018557	[SUCCEEDED] Oh, my apologies sir. I was sent here by Colonel Hsu to exterminate Motor-Runner, the leader of the Fiends.
GID00018558	[FAILED] Your curiosity and a few caps will get you a rat on a stick, but it won't get you fuck all from me.
GID00018559	Well, take this goddamn key anyways. It'll get you into the Maintenance Wing. Maybe you'll brave up and do the right thing. Good luck.
GID00018560	Well, take this goddamn key anyways. It'll get you into the Maintenance Wing.
GID00018561	Goddammit! Is there nothing I can't fuck up here? I've lost the goddamn key!
GID00018562	That's it. I'm heading for McCarran. Good luck to you.
GID00018563	'Cause it's clean. The crops taste funny if you don't use clean water, but the NCR won't give us any and it's too expensive to buy.
GID00018564	Oh no! Miss Tabitha is hurt! Someone, get a doctor!
GID00018565	There, there Miss Tabitha. It's going to be all right.
GID00018566	Miss Tabitha, your distinct lack of respiration is quite worrisome.
GID00018567	That's good, Miss Tabitha. It's important that you don't move. You might aggravate your injury.
GID00018568	Where is that doctor?
GID00018569	Don't worry, Miss Tabitha, I'll keep you warm with my exhaust.
GID00018570	I do hope the doctor doesn't get lost on the way up here.
GID00018571	Not big on reading nametags, huh? That's okay, my name is long and difficult to pronounce. Ready for it?
GID00018572	It's Boyd. Lieutenant Boyd to my friends. Colonel Hsu has me handling the policing duties for the base.
GID00018573	I've told him he could make my job a whole lot easier if he would just let me shoot anyone who talks back to me, but you know how colonels can be.
GID00018574	No, I've got this one. I don't think he's going to have much information of value, so I'm just tormenting him for fun. Thanks, though.
GID00018575	Yeah, so far this has gone exactly as expected - poorly. But with the work you've done for NCR already, you might be just what I've been looking for.
GID00018576	We captured an honest-to-God centurion of Caesar's Legion recently.
GID00018577	Sorry, this is state business, what I'm working on. You'd have to do a lot more NCR ass-kissing before they'd let you help me with this one.
GID00018578	Now what kind of MP would I be if I didn't notice anything suspicious?
GID00018579	I've had soldiers go AWOL, break-ins, thefts, you name it.
GID00018580	For you? Just the basics. Come back when you're a little more seasoned and maybe we could talk about other options.
GID00018581	Bad business if someone hurts themselves using your products, you know? Gets all kinds of unwanted attention.
GID00018582	Are you implying I have some kind of secret under-the-table stash I only offer to certain clients? Because that could get a man in trouble.
GID00018583	What do you need then?
GID00018584	Now you're talking my language. I do have an expanded inventory for people I can trust.
GID00018585	If you're willing to do a little legwork for me, I could give you access to my stash and at a discount.
GID00018586	Many of these items aren't available in the NCR, and you'll be hard-pressed to find them at a better price anywhere else.
GID00018587	[SUCCEEDED] Now you're talking my language. I do have an expanded inventory for people I can trust.
GID00018588	If you're willing to do a little legwork for me, I could give you access to my stash and at a discount.
GID00018589	Many of these items aren't available in the NCR, and you'll be hard-pressed to find them at a better price anywhere else.
GID00018590	[FAILED] I don't think so. This is what I've got. Take it or leave it.
GID00018591	[SUCCEEDED] Now you're talking my language. I do have an expanded inventory for people I can trust.
GID00018592	If you're willing to do a little legwork for me, I could give you access to my stash and at a discount.
GID00018593	Many of these items aren't available in the NCR, and you'll be hard-pressed to find them at a better price anywhere else.
GID00018594	[FAILED] I don't think so. This is what I've got. Take it or leave it.
GID00018595	I never said you were. You've been speaking to Williams, haven't you?
GID00018596	Fair enough. Begging your pardon, but this is beginning to feel like an interrogation.
GID00018597	All right. I'll take you at your word. Williams didn't say anything at all, you just came to this conclusion on your own.
GID00018598	None at all. Informed speculation on my part. Williams is very good at her job, so it remains secure... despite her best efforts.
GID00018599	No, you aren't the first person I've sent to the Vault. I'm sorry that I neglected to tell you, but I don't see how it makes any difference.
GID00018600	Yes. With the assistance of my team, of course.
GID00018601	Not yet. But our government understands the value of proactive thought. Our studies project an imbalance between production and consumption.
GID00018602	Or, for a layman such as yourself - not enough food, too many mouths to feed. Mass starvation. In a decade or so.
GID00018603	Directly? No. But we attempt to maximize its output. You have no idea how difficult it is to provide power to an entire nation.
GID00018604	Fortunately, we also have the HELIOS One facility. One of our external contractors recently got the station up and running.
GID00018605	Fortunately, we also have the HELIOS One facility. One of our external contractors recently got the station up and running.
GID00018606	We were starting to bring the HELIOS One facility online, as well. That might have increased our power output by half.
GID00018607	But some wasteland scum managed to sabotage the array. Probably got quite a laugh at our expense. Very funny indeed.
GID00018608	I'd pay a year's salary for a crack at that maniac. Not that he'd ever show his face in a place like this.
GID00018609	We were starting to bring the HELIOS One facility online, as well. That might have increased our power output by half.
GID00018610	But some wasteland scum managed to sabotage the array. Probably got quite a laugh at our expense. Very funny indeed.
GID00018611	I'd pay a year's salary for a crack at that maniac. Not that she'd ever show her face in a place like this.
GID00018612	Our efforts at HELIOS One held a great deal of promise, until some drifter blew in from the waste and managed to reroute the power.
GID00018613	As to where the power is going... who knows. Can you imagine? A drifter outsmarting professional scientists? Only in New Vegas.
GID00018614	We'd hoped that HELIOS One would boost power to McCarran and Vegas. Then some damned crusader routed all the power to Freeside.
GID00018615	I also have high hopes for our HELIOS One facility. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the two "scientists" who are working there.
GID00018616	So far, they've only managed to achieve one percent power output. I'd send help, if I could spare the personnel.
GID00018617	His name was something like... "Exceptional" or "Marvelous" or...
GID00018618	That's the trouble with this wasteland - too many damned variables. No one can account for them all.
GID00018619	Yes! That was it, exactly.
GID00018620	I... see. Of course you did.
GID00018621	I'd have to consult my records. Eight? Ten? Your point is what?
GID00018622	You want certainty? You'll never find it... especially not in the pursuit of science.
GID00018623	Do whatever you think is best. You're under no obligations. If you want the caps, you'll complete the job. Simple.
GID00018624	Take my advice. Forget about Williams. She's a talented researcher, but she doesn't understand people, and she can't see the big picture.
GID00018625	Now, I know your time is valuable, so I won't waste any more of it. Feel free to show yourself out...
GID00018626	[SUCCEEDED] All right. I'll admit that it's been difficult to find anyone willing to enter the Vault. And I'd rather get the data sooner than later.
GID00018627	You have a deal. I'll double your reward, if you bring me the data. But this is as high as my budget will allow.
GID00018628	I have no evidence that they're dead. A thousand things could have happened between here and the Vault.
GID00018629	They could have changed their minds and walked away. I wouldn't be much of a scientist if I leapt to conclusions without proof.
GID00018630	[FAILED] No. Our agreement was very specific. You bring me the data, I give you a reward.
GID00018631	We never discussed the dangers. That's your business, not mine. If you can't provide the data, I'm sure I'll find someone who can.
GID00018632	How's it look, doc?
GID00018633	What are you looking to find out?
GID00018634	Make yourself scarce. If you get yourself in trouble, I'm not going to cover your back.
GID00018635	Why I'm here is my business. If you don't have a question for me then get lost.
GID00018636	The Fiends killed everyone living here, and now they are squatting in their home.
GID00018637	This was Vault 3, but I'm sure you can tell that by all the 3s all over the damn place. Now it is a drug den for the goddamn Fiends.
GID00018638	The Fiends are degenerate drug addicts who kill and rape for fun, basically. They're human garbage - though I'm not sure about the human part.
GID00018639	You can go back to old Hsu and tell him that the mission will be completed. I just need a couple more days.
GID00018640	Is that right? And what sort of support, exactly, is it that you have to offer?
GID00018641	Good idea. Try not to get hurt out there.
GID00018642	Yeah? Nice thought, but that's not my primary mission. If you want to go it solo, more power to you.
GID00018643	[SUCCEEDED] I guess you're right. I won't be able to move fast, but I can more than hold my own in a firefight. Here, take the key...
GID00018644	Here, take this key to the Maintenance Wing. Should make getting to Motor-Runner a whole easier. I'll follow you down.
GID00018645	[SUCCEEDED] I guess you're right. I won't be able to move fast, but I can more than hold my own in a firefight.
GID00018646	Goddammit! Is there nothing I can't fuck up here? I've lost the goddamn key!
GID00018647	Well, this whole thing's improvised, and now we'll have to improvise some more and find another way through. I'll follow you down.
GID00018648	[FAILED] Thanks for the offer - but the answer is no. Once my leg is healed up, I'll take care of Motor-Runner easily enough.
GID00018649	Bad idea on all sorts of levels. Leave it to the professionals, kid.
GID00018650	What's it look like? I caught one in the leg. I killed a dozen of those degenerates sneaking my way in... but one got a drop on me.
GID00018651	I holed up in here after I killed that one. They're too stupid to unlock the doors, so I knew they'd figure whoever attacked had just taken off.
GID00018652	I just need day or two and then I'll take out Motor-Runner myself. I even got the key to his Maintenance Wing. Situation's under control.
GID00018653	[SUCCEEDED] Goddammit. I know. Was just hoping that, uh...
GID00018654	Are you trained as a doctor? Can you fix my leg?
GID00018655	[FAILED] The slug went straight through. I'm a goddamned NCR ranger, all right? I'm trained in first aid!
GID00018656	Goddammit. Fine. I'll head back. Are you saying you'll handle Motor-Runner yourself?
GID00018657	What are we waiting for? I've got a high-value target to kill!
GID00018658	Thanks, doc. The Fiends have got a ton of pharmaceuticals out there. Here's hoping a doctor's bag is in the mix.
GID00018659	All right. Let me give you the key to the Maintenance Wing...
GID00018660	Goddammit! Is there nothing I can't fuck up here? I've lost the goddamn key!
GID00018661	I don't know what to say. You'll have to find your own way to get at that sick bastard. Hope to see you back at McCarran.
GID00018662	Here, take this. It's the key to the Maintenance Wing. Should make getting to Motor-Runner that much easier. Good luck.
GID00018663	Yeah? Well, there's a ton of pharmaceuticals out there. Maybe you can find one and bring it back to me. It'd be a great help...
GID00018664	You're getting ahead of yourself.
GID00018665	Curtis? He's been in the NCR long before our conflict with the Legion. There's just no way...
GID00018666	I hope you're mistaken, but somehow I don't think so. It'd explain a lot. This is much worse than anyone expected. There could be others, too.
GID00018667	You've done everything that was asked of you. You have my personal thanks for this, and I'll make sure you receive the credit you deserve.
GID00018668	I'll have Curtis taken into custody. If he lets himself be taken alive, that is.
GID00018669	Curtis? Something's not right. He came to me today saying he was worried about the monorail. Had me put him in charge of the inspection crew.
GID00018670	Listen, you've got to get to the monorail. If it's been sabotaged, we're completely crippled here. Go!
GID00018671	Goddamn it! How could I have let this happen?
GID00018672	Come back and see us again soon.
GID00018673	Until next time!
GID00018674	Glad to do it.
GID00018675	The NCR fixed up the pipe network pretty good, and water merchants like me are allowed to have some of it to sell.
GID00018676	If we have a water license, of course. Still, it beats the inconvenience of having to trek all the way to the lake to resupply.
GID00018677	Heh, you've got moxy, buddy, but we don't take kindly to tourists on our turf. 100 caps should cover this trip into our territory.
GID00018678	I like to think that we are Prisoners Of War that managed to escape before capture.
GID00018679	I don't know how long it'll be before the Legion crosses the river, but sure as fuck I don't want to be wearing a NCR inform when they get here.
GID00018680	We figured we'd make some money in New Vegas and then beat feet.
GID00018681	Then we'd head north or something and take our caps to start up a ranch or something.
GID00018682	Perhaps, but you won't be the one to collect!
GID00018683	Our luck has gone south since we lost all of our money gambling in Vegas. We didn't go AWOL from duty to become raiders.
GID00018684	But we've seen what the Legion does to people that survive their battles. We wanted to be gone before the fighting starts.
GID00018685	And we heard there may be some safety up in New Canaan.
GID00018686	Looks like we've got a wannabe hero on our hands, boys.
GID00018687	No fucking way. We're deserters now, the NCR isn't going to throw us a ticker-tape parade for going home.
GID00018688	I'm getting tired of your chatter. Hand over 100 caps, or we start using you for target practice.
GID00018689	[SUCCEEDED] Fuck, we lose again.
GID00018690	We heard Primm was ripe for the picking, so figured we could come here and shakedown some of the suckers. We weren't expecting a sheriff here.
GID00018691	We're just trying to put as many miles from NCR as we can, we don't want to be anywhere near New Vegas when the Legion crosses the river.
GID00018692	[FAILED] I seriously doubt that. You've got about as much personality as a baked potato.
GID00018693	I'm getting tired of your chatter. Hand over the caps, or we start using you for target practice.
GID00018694	So be it. Perhaps your corpse will be better at coughing up the caps...
GID00018695	Wonderful! Straight to it, then. Have you signed the release forms? No? Doesn't matter - we'll keep that to ourselves.
GID00018696	Vault 22... where to begin...
GID00018697	No, they wouldn't have briefed you, would they? Probably better that our junior fellows stay within the bounds of their pay grade, anyway.
GID00018698	Wrong turn? Happens all the time. Do they give me a secretary? Of course not.
GID00018699	Your concerns are perfectly understandable, but I assure you, they're entirely misplaced. We would never use a technology that wasn't fully tested.
GID00018700	We aren't some motley band of Vault alchemists. We're with the government, for goodness sake. Have a little faith in us!
GID00018701	[FAILED] If you are unhappy with the terms of our agreement, then consider this an object lesson.
GID00018702	In the future, I'm sure you'll consider your agreements and contracts more carefully. Now, here is the sum we agreed to.
GID00018703	Of course, we're very grateful for your efforts, and I'll make certain that you're credited in our final report. Good day to you.
GID00018704	Ha ha! A mercenary, is that it? You won't be disappointed, I promise you. The Office of Science and Industry provides highly competitive benefits.
GID00018705	And as an external contractor, your pay would be... rather more competitive than those of our regular employees.
GID00018706	But we should keep that to ourselves, don't you think?
GID00018707	So... how about I tell you what we need, and then you can tell me whether you're up to it? No pressure, of course.
GID00018708	Skepticism can be forgiven. But I think you'll come around... if the reports I've heard are true.
GID00018709	I'm very sorry to hear that. If you should change your mind, the offer will stand. As will the substantial reward...
GID00018710	Naturally! Take all the time you need.
GID00018711	I assure you, the OSI places considerable value upon our contractors. We will take good care of you, should you decide to accept our offer.
GID00018712	Of course not! You're obviously a busy man. But if life should... quiet down a bit... I'm certain we can find a place for you here.
GID00018713	Of course not! I can see you're a woman of consequence. But if life should... quiet down a bit... I'm certain we can find a place for you here.
GID00018714	Imagine, if you will, the wasteland in bloom... vast fields of corn that grow from seeds and produce their bounty in the space of a month...
GID00018715	...orchards of trees, their branches weighed halfway to the ground, hung with fat, ripe oranges. A harvest that could feed a city... or a nation.
GID00018716	And all this... all this... requiring no more than a few of drops of precious water, and the efforts of only a handful of human farmers. Impossible?
GID00018717	All right. Straight to the point. I believe that the inhabitants of Vault 22 unlocked the secrets of vegetative growth.
GID00018718	Plants are spilling from their gate. No one tends them. No one waters them. Yet they multiply and spread in all directions.
GID00018719	Find the reason for this miraculous growth, and I promise you, the OSI will see that you are generously compensated.
GID00018720	A realist. We have that in common. A year ago, I'd have said the same.
GID00018721	But what if I was to tell you that the wasteland can yield an endless bounty, and that the secret may lie a mere few miles from where we stand...
GID00018722	We need only reach out and take it. And for that, I need you.
GID00018723	Precisely. Science has proven that truth a thousand times over, but how many wasteland savages believe it? Present company excepted, of course.
GID00018724	The bounty I described to you is no idle fantasy. It exists, in primitive form, only a few miles from where we stand.
GID00018725	We need only reach out and unlock its secret. For that, the OSI needs you.
GID00018726	Fair enough. My point is this. I believe that the inhabitants of Vault 22 unlocked the secrets of vegetative growth.
GID00018727	Good. No need to check in with the NCR authorities, I can authorize your payment from OSI accounts.
GID00018728	Vaults typically contain a server room on a lower level, where they would have backed up their research data. A computer room, you understand?
GID00018729	Download all the information on the central server to your Pip-Boy. And you'll be certain to bring me any notes or samples that you find, won't you?
GID00018730	Very well. I hope you'll consider this an open offer from the OSI. Now, I'm sure your time is valuable, so unless there was anything else...
GID00018731	Yes... goodbye.
GID00018732	The Office of Science and Industry. That's a rather expansive topic. I could talk for hours, but I'm sure I'd bore you.
GID00018733	Suffice to say, we are the leading edge of the NCR. Our work focuses on practical matters. Medicine, engineering, biology.
GID00018734	The Dam, for instance. OSI routes its energy supply to our cities in the west. That's only one responsibility of this office.
GID00018735	I thought it was a fairly straightforward assignment. It's a simple question of retrieving the data, which shouldn't prove overly challenging.
GID00018736	Downloading the data will be handled by your Pip-Boy. You might think of yourself as a mere means of conveyance. No insult intended, of course.
GID00018737	Oh? What might those be?
GID00018738	Good! I thought I sensed a kindred soul in you, beneath the wasteland veneer.
GID00018739	Isn't it? One directs one's efforts - or the efforts of others - toward a goal, and progress is made. It's a matter of incentives, nothing more.
GID00018740	I believe that the inhabitants of Vault 22 unlocked the secrets of vegetative growth.
GID00018741	[FAILED] No, I'm sure I won't require your services in the future. The OSI does not enter into long-term arrangements with its contractors.
GID00018742	Of course, we're all very grateful for your efforts, and I'll make certain that you're credited in our final report. Good day to you.
GID00018743	Wonderful! Excellent work! Let me see it... it'll take a moment to decode on my terminal...
GID00018744	You won't keep me in suspense for long, I hope? Of course I can't authorize any payments until I have the data in hand...
GID00018745	I think... Williams' decryption algorithms seem to be working...
GID00018746	Yes... here it is! The data is mostly uncorrupted. This will make the board of directors finally sit up and take notice...
GID00018747	Here, then... as promised. An agreeable sum, payable upon delivery of the data. You've more than done your part.
GID00018748	Didn't I? Did you encounter undue difficulties? Clearly not, or you wouldn't be standing here, would you?
GID00018749	All that matters is whether the data is intact...
GID00018750	I knew you were a reasonable person. Here you are... our agreed-upon sum.
GID00018751	A pleasure working with you, really! I'll make certain that you're mentioned in the final report, you have my word on it.
GID00018752	You want to renegotiate your contract. Mm. This is a very serious matter, you do understand that, don't you?
GID00018753	I realize that one's word counts for little in the wasteland, but amongst civilized people, one doesn't just... demand more than one has agreed to.
GID00018754	[SUCCEEDED] Now... wait a minute...
GID00018755	[SUCCEEDED] You're saying that I didn't file the proper paperwork, is that it? I suppose you're an expert on NCR procedures?
GID00018756	There's... there's no need to do anything rash. Naturally, OSI would be willing to negotiate for exclusive rights to that data.
GID00018757	Here. Take these caps. That's all of my contracting budget, and it's yours.
GID00018758	Now, I've... got to get back to work. I'm sure you understand. Exit's over there, you can show yourself out.
GID00018759	Director of the entire OSI? Me? If I didn't know better, I'd say you were trying to plant seditious ideas in my head. Ha ha ha.
GID00018760	No, I direct our eastern operations. I've been responsible for squeezing unprecedented levels of power from the Dam.
GID00018761	I'm also confronting the problem of food production, in what little spare time I have. But I've found some promising leads.
GID00018762	All right. Fair enough. No need to bring the military into this matter - it's between the two of us, after all.
GID00018763	Hmm... you don't cook by any chance, do you? Farber's doing his best, but it's hard to manage an army with half my staff in line for the latrine.
GID00018764	Honestly, we're fighting a lot of fires right now. The Fiends keep pressing their position from Vault 3.
GID00018765	We've got the Legion breathing down our necks across the river. We actually took an officer alive last week, but so far he hasn't spoken a word.
GID00018766	There are a lot of things I can't spare troops for right now. If you can help us, we can definitely pay you for your work.
GID00018767	Could be better, I'll say that much.
GID00018768	We set up here with our sights set on annexing New Vegas. That's a lot of resources that could do a lot of good for us. But that hasn't happened.
GID00018769	If anything, they annexed us. They rake in the profits from our soldiers and we're stuck protecting them from the Legion. Not exactly the plan.
GID00018770	As in chem fiends. Biggest gang of raiders I've ever seen. Nothing like addiction to swell your numbers. Psychotic, and completely unpredictable.
GID00018771	They've set up shop in Vault 3 to the west. Every day they attack our positions and my men repel them.
GID00018772	But every day there's more of them and less of us. I sent one of my rangers after their leader to try and destabilize them. He didn't return.
GID00018773	Hell of a thing, losing a ranger. You come to depend on them. And they come through for you so often, you forget it can happen.
GID00018774	I have Lieutenant Boyd on that already, and she's excellent. But I think she's hit a wall.
GID00018775	Talk to her, if you like. See if she has any use for you.
GID00018776	Her office is right above mine, but I think she might be interrogating right now. So she'd be upstairs on the other side of the building.
GID00018777	You? I think you've done enough.
GID00018778	Hmm... Well, why not? Given your recent arrival, at least I can safely rule you out as the leak.
GID00018779	I'd like to have absolute trust in my men, but that's just not practical right now. Go ahead and look into it. See what you find.
GID00018780	Sure. I'm all ears.
GID00018781	What? Who?
GID00018782	No? What happened?
GID00018783	Calm is what you have to be when people look to you. And it's all you can be when things are out of your hands.
GID00018784	[SUCCEEDED] I'll believe it when I see it. You've got one shot, and you're on a tight leash. I'll be watching.
GID00018785	[FAILED] Forget it. We have no use for you here.
GID00018786	We don't have much to go on right now. Lately every raiding party in New Vegas seems to have a map of our troop movements.
GID00018787	It derails everything. Supplies, reinforcements. And it'll only get worse, the longer we let it go on.
GID00018788	Captain Curtis is heading up the investigation right now. He can fill you in.
GID00018789	Crenshaw... I've met Crenshaw. At his disciplinary hearing. Still, this is hard to imagine - he was just a prankster.
GID00018790	I was afraid of this. Caesar's reach is longer than anybody guessed.
GID00018791	[SUCCEEDED] That's what the Legion calls their spies. I was afraid of this. Caesar's reach is longer than anybody guessed.
GID00018792	If only we'd caught this sooner, before he got to the monorail...
GID00018793	Still, this investigation has been valuable to us, and you deserve to be compensated for it.
GID00018794	The NCR appreciates the work you've done. Will there be anything else?
GID00018795	[FAILED] That's not exactly airtight.
GID00018796	That doesn't implicate Crenshaw any more than it does anyone else.
GID00018797	This isn't the resolution I was looking for when I assigned you to this.
GID00018798	Given the dubious circumstances under which the confession took place, the NCR can't compensate you.
GID00018799	Ordinarily I'd have to arrest you for this. But we can hardly afford to waste resources in the wake of all that's happened.
GID00018800	I think your freedom is compensation enough for whatever it is you've done here, don't you?
GID00018801	I'll be waiting.
GID00018802	That Vault is a hornet's nest. If you have second thoughts, no one would think less of you for it. But if you can get him home, it'd mean a lot.
GID00018803	Watch for civilians, too. The Fiends have been kidnapping locals. They just walk right into people's homes in the middle of the day and take them.
GID00018804	But the man you're looking for is Bryce Anders. Anders was trying to find the leader, Motor-runner.
GID00018805	You hear something like a chainsaw, you've found Motor-runner. Put a bullet in his head, and you'll have some new friends around here.
GID00018806	So you convinced those NCR sons of bitches to take an interest, did you? Well, we need the help. I'll sign.
GID00018807	Oh, I don't know anything, mister. I just think it, and then I don't.
GID00018808	Oh, I don't know anything, ma'am. I just think it, and then I don't.
GID00018809	I still have a job to do here. Some Mutants may have heard Tabitha's broadcasts and are headed here even as we speak.
GID00018810	I'll remain and direct any who show up toward Jacobstown, where they'll be much better off.
GID00018811	[FAILED] Invalid response! You have 30 seconds to vacate before security is alerted.
GID00018812	[FAILED] Invalid response! You have 30 seconds to vacate before security is alerted.
GID00018813	[FAILED] Invalid response! You have 30 seconds to vacate before security is alerted.
GID00018814	Vegas is bleeding us dry. We're tossing caps at a hundred different problems, while Caesar bides his time and lets us wear ourselves out.
GID00018815	This war is gonna bankrupt the NCR, unless we finish off the Legion fast and dirty.
GID00018816	We shouldn't be perched up at the Dam - we ought to be crossing the Colorado and sticking a boot up Caesar's ass.
GID00018817	So I hooked up with a couple other vets... bribed a Gun Runner...
GID00018818	Now we're supplying grunts, mercs, and anybody else on our side. We don't make much... but at least we're saving lives.
GID00018819	[FAILED] Invalid response! You have 30 seconds to vacate before security is alerted.
GID00018820	[FAILED] Invalid response! You have 30 seconds to vacate before security is alerted.
GID00018821	[FAILED] Invalid response! You have 30 seconds to vacate before security is alerted.
GID00018822	Hell, yes sir. Well... not officially. Not anymore.
GID00018823	They mustered me out a year ago. Administrative discharge.
GID00018824	Hell, yes ma'am. Well... not officially. Not anymore.
GID00018825	They mustered me out a year ago. Administrative discharge.
GID00018826	Sure do. Lots of folk been coming out east, sorting through junk, looking for whatever they can sell.
GID00018827	Times are tough back home. Too many people, not enough work. Unless you like shoveling brahmin shit.
GID00018828	It means my C.O. was an asshole, and I told him to eat shit. He ordered me to flog a couple "deserters."
GID00018829	Those kids didn't desert. They just got liquored up on the Strip and missed roll call.
GID00018830	I don't know what else the brass expects... half these kids don't get more than two weeks of training before they ship 'em out here.
GID00018831	Staff sergeant, Third Platoon, Bravo Company. I was at the Dam when the Legion hit us, three years back.
GID00018832	That was a shitstorm, and don't let anybody tell you different. The brass try to play it down, but most of them were back at McCarran.
GID00018833	Going home didn't feel right, not with those savages camped on the other side of the river, sharpening their knives.
GID00018834	And I still get to see my old platoon when they pass through here... make sure the new C.O. is treating them right, and sneak them extra ammo.
GID00018835	Anyway, I was always complaining about the standard issue gear. The new kids don't even get body armor, can you believe that?
GID00018836	Heh. There's a sad story behind that. Marcus smashed it just fine, but while we were gone some Ghoul named Raul came along.
GID00018837	Tabitha turned him into her personal mechanic. A slave, really. See, if I'd been standing down here, I could've warned him before it was too late.
GID00018838	Good luck. We're going to need it.
GID00018839	Yes, so try to stay out of sight, because they'll be coming this way.
GID00018840	Whatever you need to do, be quick about it.
GID00018841	[Rhonda] You're listening to Radio Free Utobitha, bringing truth to Utobithians 24 hours a day! Welcome!
GID00018842	[Tabitha] I am in control here!
GID00018843	[Rhonda] That was today's and every day's extra special guest, Best Friend Tabitha, supreme commander of Utobitha and Wearer of the True Eyes!
GID00018844	[Tabitha] I still miss you, Rhonda. After all these years...
GID00018845	[Rhonda] Also joining us from his locked cell is Raul Tejada, master mechanic who can be executed at any time! Hello, Raul. Or should that be "Hola?"
GID00018846	[Raul] Uh, either one works.
GID00018847	[Tabitha] Today you die, Raul! I command it!
GID00018848	[Rhonda] Ooooh, Raul. Supreme commander Tabitha says you die today. Any reaction?
GID00018849	[Raul] I going to obey supreme Tabitha, claro, whatever she say. Just I feel so bad I die before I fix her special robot.
GID00018850	[Silence.]
GID00018851	[Tabitha] <Growls in frustration.>
GID00018852	[Rhonda] We'll be right back after this musical interlude! Enjoy!
GID00018853	[Rhonda] You're listening to UNC - the Utobithian News Channel - with breaking news!
GID00018854	[Rhonda] The execution of master mechanic Raul Tajeda has again been commuted for a period of 24 hours to allow time for important repairs.
GID00018855	[Tabitha] <snarling> This time you will get it done, Raul!
GID00018856	[Rhonda] Joining us from his cell to comment on the situation is Raul Tejada. Raul?
GID00018857	[Raul] Hi, Tab - <catches himself> Rhonda.
GID00018858	[Rhonda] What's your take on the situation?
GID00018859	[Raul] All I want is to make that special robot work again, you know? I give it my best.
GID00018860	[Rhonda] We'll be right back after this word from our sponsor during which Raul will contemplate how lucky he is to be alive.
GID00018861	[Tabitha] Are you tired of getting chased because you're bigger than humans, and scaring them?
GID00018862	[Tabitha] Did you kill some and they overreacted? Are two-head-bear people shooting at you, and battle cattle mooing? Beware the battle cattle...
GID00018863	[Rhonda]<whispering a line prompt> "Leave the fear behind."
GID00018864	[Tabitha] Leave the Fear Behind. Meet at the Mountain Top! Enjoy life in a state of Utobitha - Free, Safe, Secure!
GID00018865	[Rhonda] <rushing sotto voce like disclaimers at the end of prescription ads> Freedom limited to following the commands of Best Friend Tabitha...
GID00018866	[Rhonda] <Cont.> Safety not guaranteed against siege or assault by two-head-bear people or battle cattles.
GID00018867	[Rhonda] <Cont.> Many infractions are punishable by death, no allowances for dumb-dumb "misunderstandings".
GID00018868	[Tabitha] Utobitha! Come feel the difference!
GID00018869	[Rhonda] Welcome back, Utobitha. It's time!
GID00018870	[Tabitha] Time for what, Rhonda?
GID00018871	[Rhonda] <sing-song> True Eye Seeing Time!
GID00018872	[Applause track.]
GID00018873	[Rhonda] I see that you're already wearing the True Eyes, Best Friend Tabitha, along with your head of True Hair. What do you see?
GID00018874	[Tabitha] Uh... I see Neil...
GID00018875	[Rhonda] First-generation Neil from down the mountain? And what is he up to?
GID00018876	[Tabitha] Standing outside his shack down there.
GID00018877	[Rhonda] In the same spot as before, or has he moved?
GID00018878	[Tabitha] A little.
GID00018879	[Rhonda] Wow! It must be so exciting to see and know all. What a powerful reminder of your ultimate authority and power for our listeners!
GID00018880	[Tabitha] I see Moe...
GID00018881	[Rhonda] Moe, the Centaur? Favorite Centaur Moe? What's he up to?
GID00018882	[Tabitha] Licking the gate. Wants out of the pen.
GID00018883	[Rhonda] Now, I'm almost afraid to ask, but do you see any - you know - threats out there?
GID00018884	[Tabitha] Threats all around us... converging... like a noose, tightening! Two-head-bear people astride battle cattles!
GID00018885	[Rhonda] <unnerved> Not the the dreaded battle cattle training to hunt mutants?
GID00018886	[Rhonda] <calmer> Would it be going too far to say that your gift of True Eyesight is the only thing saving our community from annihilation?
GID00018887	[Rhonda] Because I think it's so important for everyone - even the dumb-dumbs - how impossible it is to sneak up on us! More after this!
GID00018888	Welcome back, Utobitha. I have with me Best Friend Tabitha, who has something important she'd like to share.
GID00018889	Well Rhonda, I'm a little concerned about the number of humans that keep coming to Black Mountain.
GID00018890	Humans? Here? Why do you think they'd do that?
GID00018891	Honestly, I think they're a little jealous of the ideal society we've built here, Rhonda. And I can't blame them.
GID00018892	We have everything we need here. Food, shelter, safety, entertainment. It really is a paradise.
GID00018893	There's no arguing with the truth, is there?
GID00018894	But humans need to be aware that Black Mountain is no place for them. In fact, it's even dangerous for them here.
GID00018895	Why is that?
GID00018896	First of all, there's the radiation. That warm, peaceful glow that we all know and love doesn't have the same effect on humans.
GID00018897	You see, humans are weak, and have an inherent defect that causes them to fall apart when exposed to radiation.
GID00018898	That sounds terrible! How do they stand it? Radiation's, like, everywhere!
GID00018899	I know. They truly have a hard lot in life. Which may explain why they're so irritable all the time.
GID00018900	I don't know about you, Utobitha, but my eyes have really been opened. We'll be back after some music!
GID00018901	Hello, please remember closing time is at 5 PM. Please make your way toward an exit.
GID00018902	The REPCONN museum is now closed. Visitors are required to leave the premises.
GID00018903	Now these colorful fellows behind me are REPCONN's earliest... experiments in flight. Feel free to read the plaques and learn, Rocketeers!
GID00018904	Now for the highlight of our tour! Due to a generous donation from RobCo, this next exhibit showcases the wondrous world of - robots!
GID00018905	Around you are the incredible Eyebot, the fearsome Sentry Bot, and the always-helpful Mr. Handy. That helpfulness runs through our whole line!
GID00018906	This is the final stop on our tour. This model of our solar system is a small example of where the partnership between RobCo and REPCONN hopes to go.
GID00018907	See those little rockets zipping about? They are manned by robots, tirelessly looking for resources to mine on planets beyond our own.
GID00018908	And that's it for our tour today, Rocketeers - RobCo and its tiny partner REPCONN thank you! Any further questions, please, feel free to ask.
GID00018909	The road is a series of switchbacks up to the peak. There are three blockades, plus patrols. Sneaking past them would be... difficult.
GID00018910	Just before the peak is a kind of shanty village. More second-gens there. And then there's Tabitha's compound - heavily guarded by her Nightkin.
GID00018911	The road is a series of switchbacks up to the peak. There are three blockades, plus patrols. Sneaking past them would be... difficult.
GID00018912	Just before the peak is a kind of shanty village. More second-gens there. And then there's Tabitha's compound - heavily guarded by her Nightkin.
GID00018913	[SUCCEEDED] Help would improve the odds. Help might just make the difference...
GID00018914	All right, if you're good enough at what you do to meet me in the village up near the peak, we can talk further.
GID00018915	I'll have a plan by the time I see you - if I see you. Good luck. It's going to be a lot harder for you to get up there than it will be for me.
GID00018916	[FAILED] Hmm. While your enthusiasm is... admirable, I think I'd best stay here so I can warn other travelers.
GID00018917	For years, Black Mountain was a peaceful community. Its leader, Marcus, broadcast an invitation to Mutants throughout the wasteland.
GID00018918	That's how I found Black Mountain. So did others, most of them second generation Mutants. Marcus welcomed everyone - that was his mistake.
GID00018919	The community ended up being mostly second gen - not very bright, but easy to influence. Fine, until the Nightkin came along, led by Tabitha...
GID00018920	In a week she had most of the second-gens thinking she was some kind of prophet - and that she should be broadcasting her "truth," not Marcus.
GID00018921	Marcus saw what was coming and decided to leave before things got out of hand. He smashed the radio and left to found Jacobstown.
GID00018922	The opposite of Black Mountain! A stable community of Mutants, mostly, led by a mentally stable leader.
GID00018923	Humans are welcome there, so long as they behave themselves. Look northwest of Red Rock Canyon if you want to find it.
GID00018924	Yes... And it's not something I care to discuss with one of your kind.
GID00018925	If you have some insatiable curiosity about the matter, talk to Marcus in Jacobstown. He's more patient with such questions than I am.
GID00018926	The Nightkin are vicious in combat, and that's if you see them coming. Most don't.
GID00018927	They were created to be soldiers, and given devices to camouflage them in battle. Unfortunately, the devices drove most of them mad over time.
GID00018928	They spend most of their time at the top of the mountain, but patrol the roads after dark as well. You'd do well to avoid the mountain at night.
GID00018929	Marcus sent me here a couple of months ago to check on Black Mountain. I suppose you could say I came here as a spy.
GID00018930	But with no signs of Tabitha's weakening, and none of the second-gens ready to revolt or to come to Jacobstown, there wasn't much I could do.
GID00018931	Down here, on the other hand, I've saved a dozen Mutants from heading up the mountain. It's not much, but it's something.
GID00018932	I have my own reasons to stay away from Jacobstown for a while - reasons we won't be discussing - so I've stayed here.
GID00018933	Keep saying things like that, and I won't be so friendly. Not every Super Mutant is a brain-damaged brute.
GID00018934	Many of us are just as intelligent as basic humans - and the rest don't really have any choice in the matter, do they?
GID00018935	Yes, that's exactly what I'm telling you to do. Move on.
GID00018936	And none taken... since you apologized.
GID00018937	Of course. Sorry I bothered you. Enjoy your travels.
GID00018938	Not all Super Mutants were created equal. Or at the same time, or for the same purpose.
GID00018939	The first generation tends to be smarter, stronger, and... more civilized, I suppose you could say, than the ones made later, save the Nightkin.
GID00018940	Voice 1: She can't do this.
GID00018941	Voice 2: It's done. We're done.
GID00018942	Voice 1: Nothing's done.
GID00018943	Voice 2: She's got the authority. The only thing she can't do is change her own fate.
GID00018944	Nothing says she can't change the selection process for future overseers.
GID00018945	Voice 1: I say she can't.
GID00018946	Voice 2: You shouldn't have toyed with her like that, Roy.
GID00018947	Voice 1: We still have the majority.
GID00018948	Voice 2: We don't vote for anything anymore.
GID00018949	Voice 1: I'm not talking about voting.
GID00018950	Voice 2: What, then? You want to have a sit-in? A hunger strike?
GID00018951	Voice 1: Not exactly.
GID00018952	Voice 2: Maybe march into her office with torches and pitchforks?
GID00018953	Voice 1: Yes.
GID00018954	Voice 2: Come on.
GID00018955	Voice 1: I mean it.
GID00018956	Voice 2: What, start a revolution?
GID00018957	Voice 1: Laws don't outlast their governments.
GID00018958	Voice 2: Roy, all we have to do is wait until someone from Justice Bloc gets picked for overseer. Then we have them change the law back.
GID00018959	Voice 1: There won't be any blocs after the new overseer is picked tomorrow. Everyone's going to move on.
GID00018960	By the time we've reformed, who knows if we'll still be in the majority.
GID00018961	Voice 2: We can hold the bloc together.
GID00018962	Voice 1: You don't know that. Besides, what if the computer picks you? What if it picks me?
GID00018963	Voice 2: And your solution is to start shooting?
GID00018964	Voice 1: Not if we don't have to. Look, we arm up. We go to the lower floors, take some strategic targets. Power, food, water.
GID00018965	Just until she turns authority over to us.
GID00018966	Voice 2: The other blocs won't support it. They're tired of us having the power.
GID00018967	Voice 1: We have the majority. We don't need them.
GID00018968	Voice 2: This isn't a vote, Roy. They'll fight back.
GID00018969	Voice 1: They've never had the nerve.
GID00018970	Voice 2: Hell of a way to test it.
GID00018971	Voice 1: Are we really gonna do this? It's open. We could just leave.
GID00018972	Voice 2: I couldn't. Not after that.
GID00018973	Voice 3: We don't deserve to leave.
GID00018974	Voice 4: "A shining example." That's what it called us.
GID00018975	Voice 1: But we were! We did what we were supposed to.
GID00018976	Voice 5: Not by a long shot.
GID00018977	Voice 1: Anybody would've done what we did.
GID00018978	Voice 2: You ask me, that's exactly the problem. Now let's get on with this.
GID00018979	Voice 3: I'll go first.
GID00018980	Voice 1: Wait. Wait. People should know what happened. They could learn from it.
GID00018981	Voice 5: If there's anyone out there at all, I hope they never have to find out. Ready, Harry?
GID00018982	Voice 3: Yeah.
GID00018983	Voice 1: No no no, wait!
GID00018984	<Four gunshots in succession>
GID00018985	Voice 1: <Whimpers>
GID00018986	<Sound of a pistol dropping to the floor>
GID00018987	Hello. Could you please direct me to mistress Tabitha?
GID00018988	I wonder what mistress Tabitha has been doing with herself during my convalescence.
GID00018989	It is so good to be traveling with mistress Tabitha again!
GID00018990	Nevertheless, I must find her, so I'll just tag along with you for a bit until I pick up her trail.
GID00018991	It pleases me to see you, mistress. I owe my functional state to this human here.
GID00018992	Thank you very much. My internal clock says it's been 6 years, 52 days, 40 minutes, and 13 seconds since I last spoke to her.
GID00018993	I hope she hasn't gotten lonely.
GID00018994	Why do I even bother? Go play with something shiny, dumb dumb.
GID00018995	Why thank you! It's always gratifying to talk to one's fans. Hold on, I have something I need to do for a second.
GID00018996	Gah, stupid dumb dumbs have the attention span of a gnat.
GID00018997	[SUCCEEDED] I am supreme commander Best Friend Tabitha! Neil is nothing! You are all traitors! I sentence all dumb-dumbs to death!
GID00018998	[SUCCEEDED] A dumb-dumb revolt, you say? Then I sentence all dumb-dumbs to death!
GID00018999	[FAILED] Hello. Was that supposed to sound like a dumb-dumb? Because they sound dumber than that. They sound like this: "Duuuuuh."
GID00019000	Excuse me just a moment, would you?
GID00019001	[FAILED] Hello. Was that supposed to sound like a dumb-dumb? Because they sound dumber than that. They sound like this: "Duuuuuh."
GID00019002	Excuse me just a moment, would you?
GID00019003	You've interrupted my broadcast, dumb-dumb - so there had better be a good reason! What is it?
GID00019004	R- Rhonda? Is that you?
GID00019005	I don't know... it's been so long since I lost Rhonda, that I'm not sure...
GID00019006	There's an intruder in the dish hut! Get over there and kill whoever it is, you fools!
GID00019007	Until next time.
GID00019008	We don't take kindly to tourists on our turf. You're gonna need to pay a fine if you want to leave in one piece. 100 caps should cover it.
GID00019009	Thanks. We're leaving now, we don't want no more trouble.
GID00019010	Alright, since you look new and didn't know better, we'll cut you some slack. 50 caps.
GID00019011	That's alright, we'll take what we can from your body before the law shows up.
GID00019012	Thanks, Let's get out of here boys.
GID00019013	All right, I know you can hear me, so listen up. There's five of us left. Five. Out of... I don't know how many.
GID00019014	So... it's over. We've talked and it's over. We're not going to send anybody to die anymore.
GID00019015	So shut off our water or gas us or do whatever it is you're programmed to do. But we're done listening to you.
GID00019016	Congratulations, citizens of Vault 11! You have made the decision not to sacrifice one of your own.
GID00019017	You can walk with your head held high knowing that your commitment to human life is a shining example to us all.
GID00019018	And to make that feeling of pride even sweeter, I have some exciting news.
GID00019019	Despite what you were led to believe, the population of Vault 11 is not going to be exterminated for its disobedience.
GID00019020	Instead, the mechanism to open the main vault door has now been enabled, and you can come and go at your leisure.
GID00019021	But not so fast! Be sure to check with your overseer to find out if it's safe to leave. Here at Vault-Tec, your safety is our number one priority.
GID00019022	Not much to tell. A brahmin or two loaded up with weapons, and a whole mess of well-armed guards to make sure it ends up where it's supposed to.
GID00019023	One nifty bit, though. The gun cases are rigged to explode. So trying to loot one of our caravans doesn't do much good.
GID00019024	And that's how the NCR stays equipped. The only thing we don't bring in is energy weapons.
GID00019025	We used to. But every caravan carrying them was getting ambushed and wiped out. By someone sophisticated enough to know which was which.
GID00019026	We think it was the Brotherhood of Steel - those crazies always go hard for energy weapons. But the NCR would rather pretend they killed all of them.
GID00019027	Still plenty of other problems keeping the 15 shut down, though. Thanks for playing.
GID00019028	That'll help. Still plenty of problems out that way, though.
GID00019029	You took out a Deathclaw nest? Either you're lying, or you're tougher than you look.
GID00019030	Still plenty of troubles out that way, though. Thanks for playing.
GID00019031	That's impressive - if you're telling the truth.
GID00019032	Still, it'll take some time for routes to readjust. I expect I'll be working from here for the foreseeable future.
GID00019033	Oh, you could. You just don't want to.
GID00019034	I understand. Sorry to be a bother.
GID00019035	But... Of course. It's all right. Thank you.
GID00019036	Thank you so much! I'm so hungry!
GID00019037	Sorry I had to bother you. I've... well, I've lost everything.
GID00019038	You're very kind. I wish... well, I'll just thank you and leave you be.
GID00019039	Let me take off my medicine...
GID00019040	Bull and Bear over the Dam, at each other's throats... but a light from Vegas? Ball spinning on the wheel, more than two at the table, placing bets.
GID00019041	All lose in different ways, a dam of corpses, towns of corpses, scattered across the sand. But whose, in what shares? Even the dealer doesn't know.
GID00019042	Forecast: A rain of blood will flood the desert and not purify it.
GID00019043	Bleh. Thinking about Everywhere always makes me feel a little sick...
GID00019044	I thought you'd say that.
GID00019045	Okay. Let me take off my medicine...
GID00019046	Your face does the thinking - two to the skull, yet one gets up. Odds are against you... but they're just numbers after the two-to-one.
GID00019047	You're playing the hand you've been dealt, but you don't let it rest, you shuffle and stack, and a gamble... a gamble that may pay off? But how?
GID00019048	Forecast: Rapidly changing conditions.
GID00019049	A lot of thinking - most of it in your face, it's almost shouting at me. Sorry if I said anything weird.
GID00019050	I need to take off my medicine...
GID00019051	Local, local, the here and now... little of interest... things to buy, false hopes, and regrets watered down, washed down in dirty glasses.
GID00019052	With regret comes a girl... smiling sad, brown robe, name Veronica, half here. Wraps her and her heart up like a pack, in the pack, a key, some say.
GID00019053	Forecast: Cloudy, with a chance of friendship.
GID00019054	Ouch. Thinking small only hurts a little, but it's a sharp pain.
GID00019055	There's more to the 188 than meets the eye. Troops move back and forth on 93 all the time, and 95 is how NCR folks come and go from Vegas.
GID00019056	No shortage of customers... so long as Legion raids south of here don't get worse, anyways.
GID00019057	Not much. I hear some folks got killed down by Nelson... or was it Novac? I don't know. If they come up this way, me and dad'll go someplace else.
GID00019058	Name's Michelle. My Dad and me run this store. His name's Samuel. I take the day shift and he takes nights.
GID00019059	We came here about a month ago, when Primm went to hell on account of the prison break north of there. Found a bin to call home and set up shop.
GID00019060	That's nice. I suspect we'll stick around here, though. Business has been good.
GID00019061	You do know these old roads were numbered, right? We're standing where the 95 and 93 meet. And 95 plus 93 equals... 188.
GID00019062	Well... There's been reports of trouble south, but me and Michelle can handle ourselves. And there's plenty of soldiers about, so that helps.
GID00019063	When 15 shut down, 95 became the route NCR citizens use to get to the Strip - or limp back home, after the Strip's drained 'em of caps.
GID00019064	We get 'em coming and going. Coming, the suckers flush with caps they saved to gamble on the Strip...
GID00019065	...and going, the same folks, but now they're losers who'll trade you the shirt off their backs so they don't starve before they make it back home.
GID00019066	Add in the troopers marching back and forth from McCarran and the Dam, and well, let's just say we don't miss Primm.
GID00019067	Michelle and I ran a little shop in Primm 'till a prison break north of town spoiled it for everyone. Goddamned convicts just about shut down I-15.
GID00019068	When traffic dried up, we took to our heels to find us some customers. I'm not one to sit around waiting to get saved, and Michelle ain't, neither.
GID00019069	Samuel Kerr at your service. Me and my daughter Michelle run this fine establishment.
GID00019070	We came here from Primm about a month past. Doesn't look like much, but it's one hell of a location.
GID00019071	Guess that makes you a big hero - in Primm. Like I said, me and Michelle didn't sit around waiting to be saved. Business is better here, anyway.
GID00019072	Welcome. Please sit in the chair. The show is about to begin.
GID00019073	The show requires that you sit in the chair.
GID00019074	It is absolutely essential that you sit in the chair.
GID00019075	You have no other choice. You must sit in the chair.
GID00019076	Congratulations, martyr! Your fantastic journey is only just beginning. Please proceed to the light.
GID00019077	The light is calming, and puts your mind at ease. Go to the light.
GID00019078	Greetings, martyr, and welcome! If you're here now, it means you've been offered up as a sacrifice so that your vault can continue to thrive.
GID00019079	And who could forget when you met the love of your life? What a looker! These are just examples.
GID00019080	Do you feel that feeling stirring in your chest as you think of these things? Good. What you are feeling is peace.
GID00019081	You've led a great life. Living it has been its own reward. But it is only the beginning.
GID00019082	Close your eyes now, and imagine what joys await you in the next life - the afterlife. Can you see them? Good.
GID00019083	Currently, you may be feeling sad or angry. Perhaps you never got to have grandkids, or to enjoy the pleasures of a fresh cigar.
GID00019084	But march with your chin held high, soldier, and remember that each of us has an important role to play.
GID00019085	For some people, their role might be to heal the sick. For others, it might mean they will drive a racecar or fly a rocket ship.
GID00019086	And some of us are meant to forfeit our lives for the good of the people.
GID00019087	Sure it might not be as fun as driving a racecar, but it's every bit as important.
GID00019088	Let's take a moment to reflect on the moments that made your life worth living.
GID00019089	Think about that time you kissed your steady girl for the first time under the bleachers at the big game.
GID00019090	Or when you snuck out after curfew to catch that new flick that your parents wouldn't let you see because it was too scary. Boy, were they right!
GID00019091	Excellent, excellent! Please be patient, the tour will begin in just a moment.
GID00019092	I am so pleased you enjoyed the last tour! A new tour will begin in a moment, if you wish to wait.
GID00019093	I can answer whatever questions you'd like... provided your query is limited to REPCONN history, research and development, or RobCo.
GID00019094	REPCONN's illustrious history began way back in 2054, shortly after the famous Delta XI rocket was completed and launched.
GID00019095	REPCONN's initial focus was on the development of fuel to be used in orbital propulsion in response to the energy crisis of 2052. Sad times, indeed.
GID00019096	The company really took off when RobCo purchased REPCONN in late 2076 to develop unmanned rockets to explore the solar system.
GID00019097	As you may already know, REPCONN is an industry leader in producing alternative fuels for military and scientific purposes.
GID00019098	REPCONN scientists were pioneers in fission-based propulsion systems, and have recently had some very exciting breakthroughs with plasma systems.
GID00019099	The recent partnership with RobCo has freed our engineers from mundane business matters, allowing them to focus solely on future projects.
GID00019100	RobCo industries purchased REPCONN in 2075 to assist with some of RobCo's military projects, as well as developing unmanned space exploration.
GID00019101	The relationship between RobCo and REPCONN is mutually beneficial, and we hope that both companies bolster each other well into the next century.
GID00019102	Very well, feel free to ask me more about REPCONN at any time, don't be shy.
GID00019103	The tour showcases REPCONN's amazing scientific contributions, and the promise of many more, coupled with its parent company, RobCo.
GID00019104	Ready for the REPCONN tour, Rocketeers? Courtesy of the fine folks at RobCo, I'll be your guide today on the path of... Scientific. Discovery.
GID00019105	In the lead-lined case behind me is a spent radioactive rod from of our old reactors. No need to stand too close, let's move along, shall we?
GID00019106	Look here - a row of multi-colored plasma fuels! Careful, they may look safe to drink, but your stomach is the last place they should be.
GID00019107	Why the difference in cylinder size? Refining our production methods has resulted in higher yields of fuel over time, that's why!
GID00019108	To my right you can see a sample of some old "safety barrels" REPCONN once used to store radioactive waste. Perfectly safe.
GID00019109	On my left is an example of a mountain of REPCONN safety barrels some legislators claim are poisoning our environment. Ridiculous.
GID00019110	Behind me is our most recent rocket project, which we're keeping under our hats... until "launch," if you'll pardon the expression.
GID00019111	And in front of me is a model - not actual size - of the launch dome we are using to send our rockets screeeeaming into orbit.
GID00019112	Yes, I hear that sometimes. And then I never see the people who said it again.
GID00019113	You do look like someone who can take care of himself. But I think you'll find this is more than you bargained for...
GID00019114	You do look like someone who can take care of herself. But I think you'll find this is more than you bargained for...
GID00019115	Intruder! I have foreseen your death!
GID00019116	No! I won't let you have my Raul!
GID00019117	You! Now you've gone and done it! No one messes with my radio station!

GID00019133	Here's the plan. The gate to Tabitha's compound is guarded by several Nightkin, all of them using devices that make them invisible.
GID00019134	I'm going to draw them away from the gate by telling them I spotted an intruder in the village. Then you slip in.
GID00019135	Hello Mrs. Millet, I hope you have an excellent day at work today.
GID00019136	Hello! Have a wonderful day here at REPCONN. Remember, security is job one!

GID00019142	I'll be here a while yet, if you need any guns or ammo.
GID00019143	I didn't. My C.O. ordered me to flog a couple "deserters," and I told him to eat shit. So they kicked me out for insubordination.
GID00019144	Those kids didn't desert. They just got liquored up on the Strip and missed roll call.
GID00019145	I don't know what else the brass expects... half these kids don't get more than two weeks of training before they ship 'em out here.
GID00019146	Sure, no problem.

GID00019153	[SUCCEEDED] Please do not not make your way to the 2nd floor.
GID00019154	[FAILED] Unauthorized access. You have 30 seconds to vacate before security is alerted.
GID00019155	You won't live to regret those words!
GID00019156	No biggie there. We've been avoiding the patrols and staying low key until this mess.
GID00019157	Maybe you're right. Come on, boys, lets get the hell out of here before the law shows up.
GID00019158	And it'll be the last thing you hear!
GID00019159	Yeah, if we see the NCR, they'll be waiting for us with a bullet to the brain pan.
GID00019160	So what are we supposed to do, just run?
GID00019161	You got the caps, I got the skills.
GID00019162	Sure, boss. I'd be happy to prolong my captivity and psychological abuse to tighten some lug nuts for you.
GID00019163	Sure, I'll just pull a toolbox out from behind a conveniently-placed rock and get to work.
GID00019164	If by some chance you want to find me again, and if by some even greater chance coyotes haven't picked my bones clean, I'll be at my shack.
GID00019165	Anything's better than staying here. Let's go.
GID00019166	Sorry boss, but as much as I'd like to risk getting killed by your side, you seem to already have some help.
GID00019167	Alrighty then, I'll just head out. Alone. By myself. Into the dangerous wastes.
GID00019168	Now, music.
GID00019169	And now, music.
GID00019170	But you don't want to listen to me, do you? You want music.
GID00019171	You got it.
GID00019172	And depart we will!
GID00019173	Don't leave me here too long. I can't wait forever.
GID00019174	I just hope I won't have to use it!
GID00019175	That explains why there's been no sit-rep from Sergeant Lee.
GID00019176	It took months to get authorization for that assault. It'll be a long time before we take on the Powder Gangers again.
GID00019177	I'm not surprised. Criminals like to act tough, but they're no match for military discipline.
GID00019178	Everyone in the base has to spend a minimum of five hours a week running tactical simulations, but outside that, interest is scarce.
GID00019179	It wasn't always this way. When we first moved into the bunker, everyone was so excited that the VR systems were intact.
GID00019180	Over time, though, my fellows have become listless and less entertained by the wonders of the technology around us.
GID00019181	That's why Apprentice Watkins is such a joy to work with. Her unbridled enthusiasm for virtual combat is unparalleled.
GID00019182	Ah, the outsider. I suppose it's too much to ask that jarhead Ramos to keep outsiders away from my research.
GID00019183	I am Head Scribe Taggart, and I am much too busy to deal with the likes of you right now.
GID00019184	Some Powder Gangers did you wrong, is that it? Get in line.
GID00019185	Still, you do look capable enough, and manpower hasn't been easy to come by...
GID00019186	All right. Fine by me if you want to put yourself in harm's way. I'll mark the staging area on your map. Talk to Sergeant Lee.
GID00019187	I don't remember saying there was going to be an attack on the prison, waster. You've overstayed your welcome.
GID00019188	[SUCCEEDED] Some Powder Gangers did you wrong, is that it? Well, get in line.
GID00019189	Still, you do look capable enough, and manpower hasn't been easy to come by...
GID00019190	All right. If you want to put yourself in harm's way, I'll help you do it. I'll mark the staging area on your map. Talk to Sergeant Lee.
GID00019191	[FAILED] I don't know how they'll do it without you - if they are going to do it - but I guess they'll have to manage. Now get out of here.
GID00019192	What do you need?
GID00019193	Oh, that's so gracious of you, to offer to bodyguard me like that? But I'd only slow you down. See you outside!
GID00019194	[FAILED] I know! It's incredibly generous and altruistic of you. See you outside!
GID00019195	[SUCCEEDED] Oh! Why, uh, of course! I would never let you fight my kidnappers with my help. Uh, without it! You lead the way!
GID00019196	Then I'll defer to your superior appraisal of character and prowess in contests of arms and see you outside!
GID00019197	Whoa, really? Ho, shit! I knew I could do it. Those NCR pricks can all get on their knees and worship at the altar of fucking Fantastic!
GID00019198	But don't worry, I'll tell them what you did for me, man. Not all of it, though. They'd think I was an idiot. But some of it.
GID00019199	Keep at it, man. One day you could end up where I am. You never know.
GID00019200	I saw that on the monitors here. And you sent it to everyone. Very admirable.
GID00019201	Now that the NCR has more or less what they want, hopefully their curiosity about the plant is satisfied and they'll dig no deeper.
GID00019202	The Followers will be grateful. Here, take these, as a parting gift. I hope you'll find them useful.
GID00019203	I saw that on the monitors here. And you sent it to Freeside, where power is in short supply. A respectable decision.
GID00019204	Now that the NCR has more or less what they want, hopefully their curiosity about the plant is satisfied and they'll dig no deeper.
GID00019205	The Followers will be grateful. Here, take these, as a parting gift. I hope you'll find them useful.
GID00019206	I saw that on the monitors here. It's strange, but I can't find where on the grid the power is being sent to.
GID00019207	Nevertheless, hopefully the NCR's curiosity is satisfied now that the plant's output is improved. Here, accept these, for your efforts.
GID00019208	So I saw. Shame to let the energy go to waste, but on the other hand, now we can rest easy. Here, accept these, for your efforts.
GID00019209	Well, come back and see me after you find some caps somewheres and put 'em on you!
GID00019210	Well, I swore not to say a word, but an NCR deserter passed through some days ago and traded for supplies.
GID00019211	According to him, the NCR's decided enough's enough and's going to send in a mess of troops to take back the prison any day now.
GID00019212	Traitor! Learn what it means to betray the Brotherhood of Steel!
GID00019213	[SUCCEEDED] So you weighed the value of confirming if his location was known against your advantage of surprise. All right.
GID00019214	[FAILED] What's in doubt isn't your ability to kill. It's your ability to be thorough. Your circumspection, so to speak.
GID00019215	So again, I ask: How do you know that killing this ranger didn't make matters worse, exposing us to greater dangers?
GID00019216	That's where we are. This here little casino brought some cash and bodies into the town before them Powder Gangsters came in.
GID00019217	They can't rush us without eating a good bit of hot lead, but we are in kind of a box canyon. Guess this is as fitting a place for that as any.
GID00019218	I reckon if they thought hard enough about it, they'd realize they got more bodies than we have bullets, but for now we're safe enough in here.
GID00019219	You'll find your belongings in the chest to your right. Don't come back until you've dealt with the ranger.
GID00019220	[SUCCEEDED] I wish I could tell you, but we've had so many replacements lately I couldn't be sure. Go in and look around if you want.
GID00019221	Try not to make any trouble.
GID00019222	[FAILED] Sorry. No civilians inside. I can't start making exceptions now.
GID00019223	Best you can do is talk to someone at the station where your brother enlisted.
GID00019224	Why would I want to let you do that?
GID00019225	I ask myself the same question all the time. But energy is hard to come by around here. Gives you more control over this area than troops ever could.
GID00019226	Hell, if we lose the dam to the Legion, this little plant may be our last stand.
GID00019227	I can't tell whether you're joking or radiation melted part of your brain, but either way I don't see a good reason to let you through.
GID00019228	I'm glad we sorted this out.
GID00019229	Or you're a Legion spy trying to infiltrate our perimeter. Give me one good reason I should let you through.
GID00019230	There should. But we're not getting much power out of it so none of our enemies have a big interest in it either. Not like Hoover Dam, anyway.
GID00019231	We had a real fighting force here just long enough to take it from the Brotherhood of Steel. Then they got sent east to the dam like everybody else.
GID00019232	Caesar's Legion sends skirmishers every so often. Prodding for weaknesses, mostly. The reality is, if they really wanted it, we'd all be dead.
GID00019233	This is NCR property and we have guns. So you can only do as we please here. And it would please us if you got the hell off our lawn.
GID00019234	No need. We already have an expert hard at work on it.
GID00019235	Then again... our expert is an idiot. Hell, he might as well be a saboteur. I guess you couldn't do any worse.
GID00019236	Have him fill you in on the details. He's in the back of the building. You'll know him when you see him.
GID00019237	Keeps his sunglasses on all the time, even when he's sleeping. Idiot.
GID00019238	Stay where you are. You're not allowed in there. This is your only warning.
GID00019239	We've held off tougher enemies than you.
GID00019240	Your being here is a start, soldier. We aren't exactly overflowing with troopers here.
GID00019241	But if you really want to help us, talk to the idiot with sunglasses in the back of the plant building.
GID00019242	He's been trying to get this place running for months and hasn't made any forward progress.
GID00019243	[SUCCEEDED] Your being here is a start, soldier. We aren't exactly overflowing with troopers here.
GID00019244	But if you really want to help us, talk to the idiot with sunglasses in the back of the plant building.
GID00019245	He's been trying to get this place running for months and hasn't made any forward progress.
GID00019246	[FAILED] That uniform's got an awful lot of blood on it, soldier, and you don't look injured to me. Doesn't fit you so well either.
GID00019247	You're trying to put one over on the wrong trooper.
GID00019248	Yes. And the technology they have in this facility is like nothing I've seen. Some of it reminds me of Enclave equipment, but more advanced.
GID00019249	A weapon based upon it would be catastrophic, no matter who claimed it.
GID00019250	It's no wonder the Brotherhood wouldn't give it up.
GID00019251	I see. Then you must have some special business here, for them to have let you through.
GID00019252	Then we have that in common. Whom do you typically work with?
GID00019253	That's reassuring, although many who've made that claim to the Followers of the Apocalypse over the years have had less than pure intentions.
GID00019254	But if it's really as you say, then take my advice. This installation carries with it dangers that no one here has realized.
GID00019255	Take care what you do here, and who you listen to. Some things are best left buried with the old world.
GID00019256	That's reassuring, although many who've made that claim over the years have had less than pure intentions.
GID00019257	But if it's really as you say, then take my advice. This installation carries with it dangers that no one here has realized.
GID00019258	Take care what you do here, and who you listen to. Some things are best left buried with the old world.
GID00019259	Not yet. By some miracle they've hired an imbecile to try and decipher the systems here.
GID00019260	He's spent months working at one console trying to get the solar reflectors to track the sun.
GID00019261	What he doesn't know is that the only thing the console controls is the plant's intercom system.
GID00019262	I tried to tell him, but he insisted that the largest console had to be the most important. Still, it's only a matter of time.
GID00019263	Then I would say do it. As long as the power of this plant is committed to the regional grid and not to a weapon, we are safe.
GID00019264	If you are the one to restore output, then you can route the power where you choose, and they'll never be the wiser.
GID00019265	I can't get you past the security in the tower, but I can be of some help.
GID00019266	I've discovered a password for one of the mirror control terminals outside. You'll need it.
GID00019267	They're playing you for a fool. You'll die in that tower, just like their soldiers did. Why do you think they haven't taken care of this themselves?
GID00019268	Interesting. Forgive me for prying, but I'm curious. Are you with a particular group?
GID00019269	Interesting. Forgive me for prying, but I'm curious. Are you with a particular group?
GID00019270	That's reassuring, although many who've made that claim to the Followers of the Apocalypse over the years have had less than pure intentions.
GID00019271	But if it's really as you say, then take my advice. This installation carries with it dangers that no one here has realized.
GID00019272	Take care what you do here, and who you listen to. Some things are best left buried with the old world.
GID00019273	That's reassuring, although many who've made that claim over the years have had less than pure intentions.
GID00019274	But if it's really as you say, then take my advice. This installation carries with it dangers that no one here has realized.
GID00019275	Take care what you do here, and who you listen to. Some things are best left buried with the old world.
GID00019276	Well that explains it. NCR? Who do you fight for?
GID00019277	Ah, but there's no avoiding it. You can only outrun the choice for so long.
GID00019278	Take now, for instance. You are inside a facility with lost technology, some of it very dangerous.
GID00019279	Unless you turn and leave right now, you'll be very much involved in the lives of people you've never seen or met.
GID00019280	That's reassuring, although many who've made that claim over the years have had less than pure intentions.
GID00019281	But if it's really as you say, then take my advice. This installation carries with it dangers that no one here has realized.
GID00019282	Take care what you do here, and who you listen to. Some things are best left buried with the old world.
GID00019283	That's... an unfortunate mistake.
GID00019284	As a Follower of the Apocalypse, I've studied it all my life, but I'll never understand how people don't foresee what lies ahead on that path.
GID00019285	That's... an unfortunate mistake.
GID00019286	I've studied it all my life, but I'll never understand how people don't foresee what lies ahead on that path.
GID00019287	I don't entirely know. Our records on the company that built this place suggest that their dealings were not only in energy, but also in weapons.
GID00019288	And I've seen equipment here marked with symbols used by the Pre-War military. Targeting computers. Shock sensors.
GID00019289	A codeword comes up repeatedly in the papers I've looked through here. ARCHIMEDES.
GID00019290	Oh, the NCR has their own designs for it, no doubt. But resist the urge to send it only to the thriving communities.
GID00019291	The need for power is great everywhere. Distributing it evenly is the most rational and humane choice.
GID00019292	I was sent here when we saw that the NCR had taken it. We have no record of the facility, but its original builders were cause for concern.
GID00019293	I'm to determine the threat level of this place and do everything in my power to prevent the revival of any dangerous Pre-War technology.
GID00019294	The NCR let me stay because they are desperate for answers about this place, but I've kept them in the dark.
GID00019295	I'm a visiting scholar. Solar power technology may be important to our future and I was sent to research it.
GID00019296	I'm a man of letters. I'd be torn to pieces by the security system they have in that tower. I'd never reach the mainframe.
GID00019297	But eventually the NCR will, or if not them, Caesar's Legion. They will use this place for war.
GID00019298	Because the possibility exists you might do anything else, you're the only choice I have.
GID00019299	The Brotherhood? I never thought I'd say it, but I'm glad you're here.
GID00019300	I'm a member of the Followers of the Apocalypse, and for once we might want the same thing.
GID00019301	This place houses technology beyond anything I've seen. I'm afraid it could be dangerous if either of the warring factions here learns how to use it.
GID00019302	The Brotherhood? I never thought I'd say it, but I'm glad you're here. For once our organizations may want the same thing.
GID00019303	This place houses technology beyond anything I've seen. I'm afraid it could be dangerous if either of the warring factions here learns how to use it.
GID00019304	Then may you die in his service. I have nothing to say to you.
GID00019305	That makes sense. It is their facility, after all. At least as long as they can hold it. As for me, I'm with the Followers of the Apocalypse.
GID00019306	Then for everyone's sake, I hope you serve a worthy master. Are you a maker of war, or peace?
GID00019307	[SUCCEEDED] Very well. Yes. I'm part of the Followers of the Apocalypse.
GID00019308	If you're not familiar, we seek peace and the spread of knowledge. Knowledge that must never be lost to the world.
GID00019309	Now your turn.
GID00019310	[FAILED] I would, but I wouldn't want to influence your answer.
GID00019311	Very well. It's to our benefit that you'd be well-equipped. I'll send word ahead.
GID00019312	[SUCCEEDED] Really? You think so? We've only got the one gun, and there's two of us... and we've never done anything like this before...
GID00019313	We've never been on the Strip, either, so we don't know how many guards the casinos have. And I keep having these nightmares...
GID00019314	What are we thinking? We're gonna get ourselves killed!
GID00019315	Look, tell Sammy to give you the gun, all right? Just take it! I don't want it around, tempting us to do something stupid!
GID00019316	[FAILED] So does your face, all right? And Sammy will add a few more if you don't shut up!
GID00019317	Sammy and me got our hands on a powerful weapon not too long ago: Vance's gun. You know - Vance, of Vance and Vikki?
GID00019318	That gun's our "shot" at the big-time. We're gonna sneak it onto the Strip and rob one of the casinos. Maybe all of them!
GID00019319	We'll be known as the greatest gunslingers to ever terrorize the wastelands!
GID00019320	Really? Oh, thank god! I love that woman, but I swear this time she was gonna get us killed!
GID00019321	The gun's in the safe. The combination's 05-23-34. Take it far away from here, before she changes her mind.
GID00019322	So? That's just one of our crimes! We're depraved, stone-cold degenerates, you know? You don't want to mess with us!
GID00019323	You'll have to ask Pauline about that! She's the brains of our operation. I'm the muscle.
GID00019324	The Bison Steve is one of Primm's less-impressive casino hotels. I'd steer clear of that place, pardner, if I were you.
GID00019325	Rumor is the dealers over there cheat, and that rickety roller-coaster's liable to fall down any day 'cause it wasn't built to code.
GID00019326	Primm is a thriving resort community located in Clark County, Nevada, right along Interstate 15.
GID00019327	Whether you can't wait 'til Vegas to try your luck, or want to hit one last jackpot before you leave Nevada, Primm's your place!
GID00019328	The town's Primm-eer attraction is the world-famous Vikki and Vance Casino and Museum, so you came to the right place, pardner!
GID00019329	Just mosey on over to the display case and you'll see it plain as day. Quite a piece, that gun. Mint condition. Never fired.
GID00019330	Have you gone loco, pardner? I can see the gun with my own three photo sensors from where I'm standing right now.
GID00019331	[You hear strange sounds coming from Primm Slim. He may be trying to read a corrupted file, but it would take more science knowledge to be sure.]
GID00019332	Quit yammering on about missing guns, pardner. Primm Slim's a busy man, ain't got time for that sort of bosh.
GID00019333	[SUCCEEDED] <Primm Slim buzzes and whirs while he reformats.>
GID00019334	Well look at that. I happened across this data file locked away in an isolated sub-system.
GID00019335	[FAILED] You're plumb loco partner.
GID00019336	Yessir, you just tell ol' Primm Slim what you'd like to know.
GID00019337	Yes ma'am, you just tell ol' Primm Slim what you'd like to know.
GID00019338	Where have you been, pardner? Hiding under a rock?
GID00019339	Vikki and Vance were this nation's fourth or maybe fifth most infamous celebrity outlaw couple ever, that's who they was!
GID00019340	Primm Slim here can tell you the whole story, if you can spare a minute to hear the tale.
GID00019341	Yes, we could kill him easily enough. But sometimes you can learn a great deal by observing people, both enemies and friends.
GID00019342	Which is why it will be very interesting to observe how you choose to deal with the situation, and decide which you are. Enemy, or friend?
GID00019343	Do we understand one another?
GID00019344	I never said the ranger had to be killed. And I wasn't giving you the option. I merely asked if you understood.
GID00019345	Makes things simple for us.
GID00019346	Take it all off, and hand it to me. Then come inside, and through the door at the rear of the chamber. Paladin Ramos is waiting for you.
GID00019347	Okay, folks. I called you out here because I've grown to trust you. Primm, the town to the south, is looking for some new law.
GID00019348	I know that you guys don't have experience with law enforcement at least not on the enforcement side.
GID00019349	However I also know that you are honorable and looking for some redemption. This is our chance for redemption.
GID00019350	Now let's head down there and bring them some law!
GID00019351	Why, yes I am. It's a pleasure to meet you.
GID00019352	I'm in a bit of a predicament here. I'd be most appreciative if you'd set me free.
GID00019353	Why, I am Deputy Beagle, and I am being held hostage. Can you imagine?
GID00019354	I'd be most grateful if you would set me free.
GID00019355	I must say it's been the low point of my career in law enforcement...
GID00019356	The Powder Gangers stole into town at night and murdered my sister and her husband, the sheriff, in bed, while I was sleeping in the office.
GID00019357	I watched them for a bit, waiting for the right moment to pounce and arrest the lot of them. Taking careful notes as I watched.
GID00019358	To my dismay, they found me while I waited in the shadows and brought me here.
GID00019359	Oh that's just marvelous. I think I'll be making my way outside now. The air's a little close in here.
GID00019360	No need to rush on my account. I lost feeling in my hands and legs hours ago.
GID00019361	Well, in that case I'll just wait for you right here.
GID00019362	It should be someone brave like you, but more of a homebody. Someone who'll settle down and watch over us.
GID00019363	I heard the Powder Gangers talking about someone in the prison named Meyers who has some experience as a sheriff. He may be a good choice.
GID00019364	Also with the NCR so close by, you may be able to get them to take over the town. Not sure why they haven't helped out already.
GID00019365	I know what it's like to have a busy schedule, but surely you can squeeze this in.
GID00019366	If you run across someone whose bearing and experience screams "sheriff," simply tell him or her about Primm's perdicament. That's all it takes.
GID00019367	You will? That's just marvelous! I'll start thinking up questions for the interview!
GID00019368	The sheriff that was incarcerated up at NCRCF may be a good choice.
GID00019369	You also may be able to convince that NCR guy across the road to take the town under his wing, although martial law doesn't sound so fun.
GID00019370	What?
GID00019371	No. No, no, no!
GID00019372	How could I... Stupid! Oh god...
GID00019373	That armor isn't working. Leave it there.
GID00019374	Good luck killing something with that. Thing's busted.
GID00019375	Newsflash. Fantastic is irreplaceable.
GID00019376	Ah, shit. Shit, man. I need this. Gotta pay the bills. And I'm addicted to a lot of different kinds of chems. I mean a lot.
GID00019377	Ah, shit, man. You're direct, you're no-nonsense. How am I supposed to compete with that? I gotta pay these chem bills.
GID00019378	It was easy, man. They were going door to door asking if anyone knew any scientists. I said look no further.
GID00019379	They asked me if I knew anything about power plants. I said as much as anyone I'd ever met.
GID00019380	They asked me how well I understood theoretical physics. I said I had a theoretical degree in physics. They said welcome aboard.
GID00019381	Well hey, if you find yourself up at the mainframe, do yourself a favor and make sure you send the power to the right place.
GID00019382	It needs to go to the Strip and McCarran.
GID00019383	What else? I'm in charge. This whole operation depends on me. No Fantastic, no power. Got the whole NCR suckling my teats, and it feels so good.
GID00019384	No, man. I know exactly what I'm doing. I just don't know what effect it's going to have.
GID00019385	Over there controls power in this building. That station has readouts on the computer network.
GID00019386	That big knob there makes a crazy noise. Sparks come out of that slot if you put stuff in it. And I'm learning more every day.
GID00019387	Ah well. Guess I'll have to wait for the next curious sucker.
GID00019388	[SUCCEEDED] Aw, man. How am I supposed to buy chems now? Fine. Here.
GID00019389	[FAILED] Ha! You had me going for a second there. Then I remembered that there's only one Fantastic. I'm king of this dump.
GID00019390	There's these two terminals outside. They control the mirrors. I tried fooling with them but didn't get very far.
GID00019391	You'd have to get them to talk to the mainframe up in the tower, then do the rest from up there. I'm guessing. But it sounds good, right?
GID00019392	Hey, you're not thinking of going up there, are you?
GID00019393	Damn right, you're not. Goddamn right. Why would they? You can't top this guy. Just a little more time. You can't keep Fantastic down for long.
GID00019394	Damn right, you're not. Goddamn right. Why would they? You can't top this guy. Just a little more time. You can't keep Fantastic down for long.
GID00019395	Because I get paid, that's why. Per kilowatt-hour, whatever the hell that is. That's where the NCR wants the power, so that's where I want it.
GID00019396	But you know, you do that, maybe I put in a good word for you with them. Fantastic's little helper. There's a reputation you can hang your hat on.
GID00019397	Well, see, we're getting power, because the guy running this place is Fantastic.
GID00019398	But the mirrors outside aren't aimed right, so we're running at one percent efficiency. And I guess that just isn't good enough for some assholes.
GID00019399	Trouble is, most of the controls for this place aren't here - they're in the tower.
GID00019400	And that place has some crazy Pre-War security system that the dumbshit NCR set off when they took over. Killed two guys. Now they won't go near it.
GID00019401	They want me to make an omelet, but I can't break any of their eggs, know what I'm saying?
GID00019402	Fuck, man. Everything. I push buttons. I turn dials. I read numbers. Sometimes I make up little stories in my head about what the numbers mean.
GID00019403	Like one time I imagined they were a code to get into a vault full of naked women. Man, how cool would that be?
GID00019404	Worried? Do I look worried to you? I've got this under control, baby. No one else can do what I do here.
GID00019405	Yes Lieutenant!
GID00019406	Are you ready to depart for Primm?
GID00019407	Yes sir!
GID00019408	Ok, we have some soldiers heading to town now. I'll have them sweep the Bison Steve before they start regular patrols.
GID00019409	Later.
GID00019410	Quiet.
GID00019411	Quiet!
GID00019412	You name it. Anything that comes within a thousand yards that looks like trouble.
GID00019413	Lately we been getting ghouls, coming from the road to REPCONN, out to the west. Quite a few, last couple days.
GID00019414	The big threat is the Legion coming from the East. If they decide to attack with a full force they'll run us over. But so far we been lucky.
GID00019415	Were they tough? I was in the Khans, man. It doesn't get any badder.
GID00019416	That's none of your business, smoothskin!
GID00019417	I already told you how to get up here. Big room on the east side of the first floor. Take the stairs up. Got it?
GID00019418	That's none of your business, smoothskin!
GID00019419	Jason was very clear. Get rid of the demons, then report back. He didn't tell you to poke around down there. Got it?
GID00019420	Oh, you haven't run across Bright's little cult upstairs, eh?
GID00019421	Harmless bunch, really. Religion and me never really got along, but they're good company. I helped out with odds and ends.
GID00019422	Hey Jason, your rockets are ready!
GID00019423	You mess with a man's radio, and he might take it personal like, you hear?
GID00019424	Now, who can tell me the primary components of gunpowder?
GID00019425	The principles of fusion are relatively simple.
GID00019426	...then you bring your second unit up to provide covering fire, like so...
GID00019427	It's an old hotel and casino here in town. Old Laurie used to rent out rooms there, but she took off months ago.
GID00019428	Across the way from the Vikki and Vance, the other old casino. Can't miss it.
GID00019429	Yes, that's everything. I'll tell Jason the rockets are ready. It's time to get this over with.
GID00019430	Yes. I'll tell Jason that the Great Journey can begin.
GID00019431	My specialty is a radscorpion venom casserole. It's a more appetizing than it sounds!
GID00019432	The venom has a sharp, smokey flavor, and it numbs your mouth so fierce you'll forget you ever had a tongue!
GID00019433	It's perfectly safe, long as you don't have sores in your mouth for the venom to find your blood. 'Cause that'll kill you dead.
GID00019434	Fine by me.
GID00019435	You were the one who came talking to me.
GID00019436	If you change your mind, you know where to find me.
GID00019437	Not far from it. When we reclaimed this bunker, I found a number of VR tapes. Most were corrupted, but a few programs still ran.
GID00019438	Using those as my foundation, I was able to code the training VR, as well as other applications.
GID00019439	Chris shall be declared the Saint of the Great Journey before we depart. I hope this will ease his sadness...
GID00019440	It is the creator's will, and I must submit. There is no malice in it. We would take him with us if we could.
GID00019441	To our new friend, we say thanks, and promise never to forget how he cleared from our path the demons who sought to stay our Journey.
GID00019442	But to Chris, we owe more than thanks. Chris, you have made this Great Journey a reality.
GID00019443	From this moment forward, you will be remembered as the Saint of the Great Journey. We shall never forget you.
GID00019444	I ask that you forgive us, Chris, and give us your blessing, and we bestow ours upon you.
GID00019445	Seekers, board the rockets, take your seats. The Great Journey awaits! To the promised land we go! To the Far Beyond!
GID00019446	Let's hope you do.
GID00019447	Stop wasting time.
GID00019448	Get moving.
GID00019449	Hurry up.
GID00019450	Like I said, find the metal staircase in the big room on the east side of the building. It's where they used to make rockets.
GID00019451	Big room. Metal staircase. East side of the building. Is that too many syllables for you?
GID00019452	Who I am doesn't matter, smoothskin. Stop wasting time and get up here.
GID00019453	What, you think I'm too stupid to pull it off? I know enough to get their rockets working, don't I? So I can make them fail, too!
GID00019454	Like I could forgive myself for getting duped like this? They used me! And now they'll throw me away!
GID00019455	And dying would be worse than this? Used up and thrown away like garbage?
GID00019456	Oh, so I've redeemed the human race, is that it? What a crock! The human race can't stand me!
GID00019457	So you want me to accompany you on your adventures across the wasteland, is that it?
GID00019458	Life among humans again, that's what you're suggesting?
GID00019459	I guess... I guess it's the only chance I've got.
GID00019460	I can't believe I'm agreeing to this, but I'll give it a try. I'll get Jason and his flock on their way, and then I'll head for Novac.
GID00019461	Life among humans again, that's what you're suggesting?
GID00019462	I guess... I guess it's the only chance I've got. Maybe it'll be different this time. I was never a Saint before.
GID00019463	I can't believe I'm agreeing to this, but I'll give it a try. You go launch the rockets. I'm on my way to Novac.
GID00019464	Then bring me Sugar Bombs. Three boxes should do the trick. Add those to the fuel mixture and "Boom!"
GID00019465	I'll show those rotten ghouls! And they'll know exactly who did them in!
GID00019466	Then bring me Sugar Bombs. Three boxes should do the trick. Add those to the fuel mixture and "Boom!"
GID00019467	I'll show those rotten ghouls! And they'll know exactly who did them in!
GID00019468	I said I need three boxes of Sugar Bombs, not less than three.
GID00019469	I'll mix the Sugar Bombs into the fuel mixture before they launch. They'll never suspect a thing... until it's too late.
GID00019470	I'll mix the Sugar Bombs into the fuel mixture before they launch. They'll never suspect a thing... until it's too late.
GID00019471	But first I'll need the other parts we talked about.
GID00019472	All right. Go on.
GID00019473	Obviously. It's taken months, but I've nearly got them in working order. Soon they'll take us to the Far Beyond.
GID00019474	I was skeptical at first, of course - being a man of science - but Jason is certain, and I believe in Jason.
GID00019475	I'm the flock's resident engineer. I've always been good with machines. Jason says the Great Journey would've been impossible without me.
GID00019476	Of course, my skills aren't much use unless I have the right materials. That's where you come in.
GID00019477	When I joined the flock, Jason made it clear that he wanted me to supervise the repairs, not do them myself.
GID00019478	It would be a waste of my gifts to work on just one system at a time. From up here, I've been able to supervise the entire project.
GID00019479	I thought we were past all that, smoothskin. But you just can't resist the chance to mess with me. Typical human.
GID00019480	I was human once, you know. Grew up in Vault 34, northeast of here.
GID00019481	Nice upbringing, if you like assault rifles and target practice. But oh, you prefer machines that don't shoot people? Not so nice then.
GID00019482	Who should maintain the Vault's reactor? Houser? Mitchell? No - make it Haversam. He likes machines!
GID00019483	Haversam won't mind getting irradiated! Haversam won't mind mutating! He's already ugly as it is!
GID00019484	Haversam won't mind when his hair starts falling out after a few years. There's no connection, Haversam! You're neurotic!
GID00019485	Bald? You call this bald, smoothskin? I'm a monster! A monster!
GID00019486	Stop making fun of me! But you're telling the truth, aren't you?
GID00019487	Oh no! How could they do this to me? For two years? My god, I've been a joke to them!
GID00019488	Do you have any idea how easy it'd be for me to sabotage those rockets? That'd be a joke, huh? One hell of a joke!
GID00019489	[SUCCEEDED] Oh god! You're telling me the truth, aren't you...?
GID00019490	Oh no! How could they do this to me? For two years? My god, I've been a joke to them!
GID00019491	Do you have any idea how easy it'd be for me to sabotage those rockets? That'd be a joke, huh? One hell of a joke!
GID00019492	[FAILED] I see your ploy, smoothskin. I won't fall for your trap. You can plainly see that I'm a ghoul myself. You can't turn me against my flock.
GID00019493	Stay away from me.
GID00019494	Good riddance.
GID00019495	Good idea.
GID00019496	Please do.
GID00019497	Leave me alone! Everyone else does!
GID00019498	The rockets are ready, Jason. The Great Journey can begin. Good luck, I guess.
GID00019499	The rockets are ready, Jason... ready to carry you and your little clan on the "Great Journey." Bon voyage.
GID00019500	We have everything we need to launch the rockets, Jason! The Great Journey can begin!
GID00019501	It pleases me to hear this. Truly, the creator sent you to help us in our time of need.
GID00019502	Well, saints alive. That is a load off. Nothing to be done, though. Those ghouls just didn't know when they weren't wanted. Couldn't take a hint.
GID00019503	And aren't you just the most unexpected gift our little town ever had? Here, take this. And go buy yourself something nice.
GID00019504	Leave? I don't believe that was what was discussed. They could be back tomorrow knocking on my door wanting hand-outs.
GID00019505	I'm sorry, I know what I promised, but my mind is just not at ease about this. I'm afraid I can't pay you for what you done.
GID00019506	And I bet he told you it's the creator's will for you to risk your ass, instead of him, right?
GID00019507	Well, good luck with that! I'd give you a hand, but no thanks. I may look like a corpse, but I'm partial to living!
GID00019508	A stash of Stealth Boys. Are you kidding me?
GID00019509	If there was some big stash of devices in here that made you invisible, do you really think we'd be having this conversation?
GID00019510	The only thing you'll find up here is a bullet hole between your eyes. Got any better ideas?
GID00019511	Maybe you noticed a bunch of invisible monsters out there? I've been in here trying not to get dead.
GID00019512	Stop looking at Antler!
GID00019513	No eyes on Antler! You make him nervous!
GID00019514	Eyes to yourself, human!
GID00019515	Your eyes on Antler! Stop looking!
GID00019516	You touched Antler!
GID00019517	Now you pay!
GID00019518	Antler is my friend!
GID00019519	Antler loves me! Not you!
GID00019520	No one touch Antler but ME!
GID00019521	Antler bring us here for hundreds of Stealth Boys, human. Antler thinks big. Antler IS big.
GID00019522	Antler don't bring us here for Stealth Boys some puny human carry. Pull head out of your ass.
GID00019523	Who is Antler? WHO IS ANTLER?
GID00019524	Antler, the human asks about you! What do I tell it? All right.
GID00019525	All right... Yes, yes, of course.
GID00019526	Who Antler is, not important to you. Antler wants that you deal with me.
GID00019527	Cut it out, human. Serious. Final warning.
GID00019528	You did it now! Antler's horns stabbing! Antler MAD!
GID00019529	Ok, I'll add the quest.
GID00019530	Sure thing buddy.
GID00019531	Very well. We don't need a huge amount. Two to three liters should be enough.
GID00019532	All right. Anything else?
GID00019533	To sabotage the rockets, I'll still need a quantity of the igniting agent.
GID00019534	To sabotage the rockets, I'll still need the thrust control modules.
GID00019535	To sabotage the rockets, I'll still need to get them ready for launch. I still need a quantity of the igniting agent and the thrust control modules.
GID00019536	For the fuel source, any shielded nuclear waste should do the trick. That's why we can't use the waste on the launch pad. Too much decay.
GID00019537	As for the computer parts, the thruster control systems aren't complicated, so any good mix of components is all I need.
GID00019538	I was close to completing work on the rockets before we were driven into hiding on the top floor.
GID00019539	Two components were missing: a quantity of Isotope-239 igniting agent, and a set of thrust control modules.
GID00019540	The igniting agent is highly radioactive, and decays quickly. That's why we can't use the drums that leaked down on the launch pad.
GID00019541	It's no longer potent enough. I need you to find an intact, shielded container of the igniting agent.
GID00019542	As for the thrust control modules, they were custom-built for these rockets. They won't even launch without them.
GID00019543	As I said before, I need an intact, shielded container of Isotope-239 igniting agent, and a set of thrust control modules.
GID00019544	All right. What would you rather be doing?
GID00019545	All right. What would you rather be doing?
GID00019546	REPCONN has been ransacked so many times by scavengers, it's hard to know where the components might turn up. IF they turn up.
GID00019547	Jason has mentioned some industrial ruins to the east that are supposed to be highly radioactive.
GID00019548	I'd start by visiting local junk merchants or traders and see if that turns anything up.
GID00019549	Scavengers wouldn't know the value of the modules just by looking at them. If you know any junk dealers in the area, I'd start there.
GID00019550	All right. Carry on.
GID00019551	Oh! Well I'm Alice and you've already met my beau, Dusty. He's sweet, ain't he? I don't care what my mama said, I know how to pick 'em.
GID00019552	Oh! Well I'm Alice and that handsome stranger yonder is my husband Dusty. Going on fifty years, now.
GID00019553	I keep waiting for him to leave me for some young thing with platinum blonde hair and hoop earrings, but he still sticks around.
GID00019554	Says it's my cooking. I think it's because I know which Brahmin udder you can milk without getting kicked in the noggin.
GID00019555	We set up this ranch years back when Novac was just getting settled.
GID00019556	But now with all the danger on I-15, folks are starting to come through here from all over. Novac might just be the next Nevada boom town.
GID00019557	Oh, we keep to ourselves, for the most part. Try not to pry. I think Jeannie May gets bothered that we aren't more sociable, but it's just our way.
GID00019558	Ain't that we don't appreciate what she's done, managing this town like she has, but I worry she feels that way anyhow.
GID00019559	Not that there ain't others who pry around here. That No-bark was skulking around our yard last week.
GID00019560	<Laughs> I thought he was our cow-killer. Was about to lash him with our bullwhip till I saw who it was. He's harmless, though.
GID00019561	Part of me wishes I could see things like he sees 'em, all full of mystery.
GID00019562	Bless her. Seems like every traveler I get in here tells me the same thing.
GID00019563	They see the sign and think, gift shop? That's just too good to be true. But Jeannie May always points them back in my direction.
GID00019564	Well, a friend of Jeannie's is a friend of mine. And my friends get a discount at my store.
GID00019565	You just... did it? Just like that, on a whim?
GID00019566	Well listen, sir, if something like that crosses your mind about me, please let me know. I'm sure we can work something out.
GID00019567	Will there be anything else?
GID00019568	You just... did it? Just like that, on a whim?
GID00019569	Well listen, ma'am, if something like that crosses your mind about me, please let me know. I'm sure we can work something out.
GID00019570	Will there be anything else?
GID00019571	Ki- killed her? Why would you do something like that?
GID00019572	I- I'm sorry to hear that. She's a nice woman. Was. She might've grown on you.
GID00019573	She's usually real good about those calls. Something must've happened.
GID00019574	I hope just because I said she and I were friends doesn't mean you and I can't still be friendly.
GID00019575	Will there be anything else?
GID00019576	Lord almighty. I can't for the life of me imagine her doing anything that'd make someone want to kill her.
GID00019577	Not that I'm saying you're a liar, of course! I'm just surprised, is all.
GID00019578	Will there be anything else?
GID00019579	No. Antler says you are solution. Plus can't have you skulking around, making trouble.
GID00019580	Do as Antler says, or feel his horns. Up to you.
GID00019581	No! Antler was clear! Do as Antler says or feel Antler's HORNS!
GID00019582	You mean... you don't want anything for it? I don't have any caps or anything...
GID00019583	I can just have it? For free?
GID00019584	You... are you serious? I can't offer anything in exchange, you know?
GID00019585	I can just have it? For free?
GID00019586	I've been drinking whatever I can find, but I can't do it anymore. I need purified water.
GID00019587	Please... if you find any...
GID00019588	Please, if you find some... please...
GID00019589	I knew it was too good to be true... there are no good souls in the Wasteland.
GID00019590	Go. Just leave me alone to die...
GID00019591	I... I understand. You have to look out for yourself.
GID00019592	Just leave me...
GID00019593	Really? Seriously? My God. Thank you. Thank you so much. I'll never forget this!
GID00019594	Water... precious water... thank you! You're a saint!
GID00019595	My... thank you. Thank you so much. You've saved my life. Bless you.
GID00019596	Oh... I guess that's understandable. Got to watch out for numero uno and all.
GID00019597	Just leave me...
GID00019598	I... I understand. You have to look out for yourself.
GID00019599	Just leave me...
GID00019600	An innovation from Med-Tek, the My First Infirmary will automatically diagnose and treat any injury you might sustain.
GID00019601	It will also make any of the pesky rads you've accumulated in the Wasteland vanish instantly.
GID00019602	Just switch on the Jukebox, and instantly the room will fill with music to keep you entertained.
GID00019603	The music selections have been hand picked by none other than Three Dog of Galaxy News Radio.
GID00019604	From the keen minds at Med-Tek, the My First Laboratory will instantly detoxify you, removing any nasty addictions from your body.
GID00019605	If you're feeling the need to experiment, just set the lab to "brew" and a day later, it will produce a random useful compound.
GID00019606	Remember that while the lab is brewing, you can't use the detoxify functions.
GID00019607	The Nuka-Cola machine will dispense Ice Cold Nuka-Cola.
GID00019608	Once you've dispensed 8 of them, the machine will have to be restocked in order to make regular Nuka-Colas ice cold.
GID00019609	If you come across any schematics in the Wasteland, you'll be able to construct its contents on this specially designed table.
GID00019610	Certainly. I am programmed with a multitude of hair shaping scenarios, if you would care to choose one, I would be happy to replicate it for you.
GID00019611	I don't give my help to enemies of the NCR. Maybe you can find a raider "medic" to fix you up.
GID00019612	Are you sure? You won't be able to read in the dark as well.
GID00019613	Sure. I can help you out.
GID00019614	Well, one thing we do have is a good supply of Rad-Away. Sure, I can help you with that.
GID00019615	No, sorry, we're totally unprepared to deal with radiation sickness.
GID00019616	Ha ha, just kidding, of course I can!
GID00019617	We always make sure to keep an ample supply of Rad-Away. Most of us haven't had the exposure outsiders like you take for granted.
GID00019618	Sure can. Quick and easy.
GID00019619	In that case, stand just like that for a second. I want to make some toast.
GID00019620	Suit yourself.
GID00019621	All right, but don't blame me if you end up sterile.
GID00019622	Whatever you say. Hey, is that a little patch of ghoul rot on your cheek there?
GID00019623	Suit yourself. I'm sure there are ghouls and other mutants who once said the same thing.
GID00019624	If that's the way you want it, it's all the same to me.
GID00019625	Okay. And remember, if this doesn't help, try taking a bath in tomato juice.
GID00019626	Okay... all done.
GID00019627	Just stand still and try to ignore the tingling.
GID00019628	This might tickle a little. Or it might cause searing, agonizing pain to shoot through your body. You never know.
GID00019629	I bet you could make some of the money letting people work on their tans next to you.
GID00019630	Well, come back when you do. I'll be here.
GID00019631	Well, if you scrounge it up, the help is here waiting for you.
GID00019632	Then I can't help you much. Now, maybe if you enlisted....
GID00019633	Here we go. You'll be rad-free in no time.
GID00019634	Then I can't help, sorry. Just following protocol.
GID00019635	Then I can't help you. Sorry.
GID00019636	And a quick shot... all done.
GID00019637	Excellent. Will do.
GID00019638	Okay.
GID00019639	Your decisiveness is truly a wonder to behold, boss.
GID00019640	Mmm hm.
GID00019641	What is this, the Hokey Pokey?
GID00019642	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00019643	<bark!>
GID00019644	Don't be playing with my heart now, gets me pissed.
GID00019645	You sure now? All right.
GID00019646	Either shoot or don't, but don't be wishing and washing about it.
GID00019647	You're like a switchblade stuck on flick.
GID00019648	Going to give a lightswitch a run for its money. Click click click.
GID00019649	Oh, pumpkin, you make grandma so happy!
GID00019650	All right. Guess I'll be around Novac for a while longer, until I figure out what I want to do with myself. See you around.
GID00019651	That's why you're the boss. You always make the right decisions. I'll just head home. Home to my lonely, abandoned shack in the middle of nowhere.
GID00019652	Okay. Then I guess I'll be back at the 188. Maybe digging in some dirt for scrap metal or something.
GID00019653	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00019654	I'll head back to the Old Mormon Fort. If you need me, just swing by.
GID00019655	<whimper>
GID00019656	Fine then.
GID00019657	I'll get out of your hair, then.
GID00019658	All right, then, dearie. Now you promise to come visit grandma soon, you hear?
GID00019659	I am in command of my faculties! In command of my troops!
GID00019660	Antler guides me in all things! As I in turn guide my kin!
GID00019661	I see. Well, spare me the details.
GID00019662	Damn it, I'm going to miss that crooked, yellow smile...
GID00019663	All right, you did your part, so I'll do mine. Look around up here if you want. I'm going to make a break for topside.
GID00019664	He did, did he? I swear, I should tear the rest of the hair out of that cocksucker's head.
GID00019665	Send a rescue mission after Harland? Nah, let's just send some smoothskin whose radio got broke!
GID00019666	Harland's tough! He probably enjoys waiting to be attacked at any moment! He probably loves eating nothing but roach meat!
GID00019667	Licking up condensation from a rusted pipe is his idea of fun! So's doing his business in a corner, and smelling it for days!
GID00019668	But oh, that's right - the crisis is that you need some computer parts! Well, you can go fuck yourself until you get my friends out of this mess.
GID00019669	And I thought I was old. It's a junkshop east and slightly north of here. There's an old woman running it. Gilbert, or something.
GID00019670	No! I won't do it!
GID00019671	Shhh. Shhh. Can't sleep. Can't sleep. Shhh.
GID00019672	Stop it, stop it, stop it!
GID00019673	Stay in control. Stay in control.
GID00019674	Not real. Don't look. Not real.
GID00019675	Stop talking to me!
GID00019676	Leave me alone!
GID00019677	Get outta my head!
GID00019678	Thank you so much.
GID00019679	I wonder what it's like to be able to "get going" whenever you like.
GID00019680	I certainly hope so. It gets lonely down here on the floor.
GID00019681	Well, thank you so much, so very much, for ruining my life.
GID00019682	My problem is that I'm no longer a deputy. I'm just a Beagle now.
GID00019683	Apparently two-and-a-half months of law enforcement experience doesn't count for anything. The new regime is just that - all new.
GID00019684	He's rude. Just don't tell him I said it. Primm has a sheriff now, just not as supportive as I would've hoped.
GID00019685	My problem is that I'm no longer a deputy. I'm just a Beagle now.
GID00019686	Apparently two-and-a-half months of law enforcement experience doesn't count for anything. The new regime is just that: all new.
GID00019687	He's a good sheriff but a hard man. He doesn't abide by anyone slinking by the rules. I guess there won't be any trouble, but the man's law is hard.
GID00019688	My problem is that I'm no longer a deputy. I'm just a Beagle now.
GID00019689	Slimm is alright, I don't wish him no harm, but the law to him is a set of logic.
GID00019690	Not everything is black and white, not sure a robot can ever understand that.
GID00019691	Oh no! I'm just the deputy. And I can't be a deputy without a sheriff. It's called chain of command!
GID00019692	But - but the town doesn't have a Sheriff! I don't have an employer, and that means I don't have a job.
GID00019693	If you think you might be able to help, come find me. I thank you for all you've done.
GID00019694	Maybe next time you can bring a new sheriff back with you!
GID00019695	All right. Goodbye.
GID00019696	I do thank you so kindly for your efforts.
GID00019697	Why, this is the Vikki and Vance Casino and Museum - Primm's Primm-eer tourist attraction and resort destination! Yeehaw!
GID00019698	Primm Slim at your service! Authentic cowpoke and official spokesbot of the Vikki and Vance Casino and Museum! Yeehaw!
GID00019699	Dang it. I hope you'll keep looking.
GID00019700	Those thieves had some gall, stealing from a museum dedicated to romanticizing a couple of criminals!
GID00019701	I'll make sure the gun ends up back on display. I thank you, Primm thanks you, and I do believe Vance'd thank you, if he could.
GID00019702	Have it your way, pardner. Maybe work up your curiosity by having a look at thrilling exhibits like the genuine Death Car and Vance's machine gun!
GID00019703	Yahoo! I ain't had a chance to tell their tale in a mess of years.
GID00019704	First things first: any bosh you've heard about Vikki and Vance being copycats ain't nothing but ill-tempered slander.
GID00019705	Fact is, they begun their crime spree two days before Bonnie and Clyde robbed their first bank - so who was copying who?
GID00019706	Now true, Vikki and Vance didn't exactly cut a wide swath of murder and bank robbery across the central U.S., like Bonnie and Clyde did.
GID00019707	It was more like a narrow swath of shoplifting, check-cashing fraud, and gas pump driveoffs - but crime is crime! They drove reckless, too.
GID00019708	Having lived by the gun - well, Vance owned one, anyway - it was only fitting that the duo of desperados would die by the gun.
GID00019709	Perhaps it was fate itself that accidentally drove them into a crossfire between police and a gang of bank robbers in Plano, Texas.
GID00019710	Or maybe they just didn't notice until it was too late. It's been said that Vikki would have tried to cash a bad check in that bank, had she lived.
GID00019711	We'll never know for sure. All we know is that the crossfire tore the car and both occupants to pieces, and the police issued an official apology.
GID00019712	You can put your eyes on the genuine Death Car just over yonder, and there's Vance's machine gun in the case next to it!
GID00019713	You got it, Pardner. Primm Slim loves to spin a yarn.
GID00019714	First things first: any bosh you've heard about Vikki and Vance being copycats ain't nothing but ill-tempered slander.
GID00019715	Fact is, they begun their crime spree two days before Bonnie and Clyde robbed their first bank - so who was copying who?
GID00019716	Now true, Vikki and Vance didn't exactly cut a wide swath of murder and bank robbery across the central U.S., like Bonnie and Clyde did.
GID00019717	It was more like a narrow swath of shoplifting, check-cashing fraud, and gas pump driveoffs - but crime is crime! They drove reckless, too.
GID00019718	Having lived by the gun - well, Vance owned one, anyway - it was only fitting that the duo of desperados would die by the gun.
GID00019719	Perhaps it was fate itself that accidentally drove them into a crossfire between police and a gang of bank robbers in Plano, Texas.
GID00019720	Or maybe they just didn't notice until it was too late. It's been said that Vikki might have tried to cash a bad check in that bank, had she lived.
GID00019721	We'll never know for sure. All we know is that the crossfire shot the car and both occupants to pieces, and the police issued an official apology.
GID00019722	You can put your eyes on the genuine Death Car just over yonder, and there's Vance's machine gun in the case next to it!
GID00019723	Me? I'm Sammy, of Sammy and Pauline, the wasteland's most dangerous and notorious criminal duo!
GID00019724	You better not mess with us or you'll end up face down in a shallow grave!
GID00019725	We ain't never heard of you, either, so the not being impressed is mutual.
GID00019726	Come a week or so, though, and everyone will've heard of Sammy and Pauline! Just you wait!
GID00019727	I'm Pauline, of Sammy and Pauline, the wasteland's most dangerous and notorious criminal couple!
GID00019728	You'd best not mess with us, or you'll have a bullet hole where your eye used to be!
GID00019729	Simple! Up 'til now, we committed our crimes stealthily, leaving no evidence behind. So we never built a rep.
GID00019730	But that's gonna change with our next score. You just wait and see.
GID00019731	Why would I deny it? I was the one that hacked that Cowboy Robot while Vance kept him busy. Ain't the first thing we stole. Won't be the last.
GID00019732	You'll see! You'll feel stupid that you made fun of us when you learn how rich we are!
GID00019733	Well, you can call Beagle a deputy so long as you don't harbor too high an opinion of the word.
GID00019734	Boy was 'bout as useful as tits on a radscorpion. Only qualification he ever had was to be brother to the wife of the sheriff.
GID00019735	Still, I s'pose he don't deserve what's befell him. We would've considered paying the ransom, if we'd had caps to spare.
GID00019736	I feel safer already. Meanwhile, there's still more of them Powder Gangers out there than I care to count.
GID00019737	What we need around here is a real sheriff. Someone who can help fight off the next attack.
GID00019738	Kind of too bad you didn't do it the other way around! Primm ain't got no future until rule of law comes back to town.
GID00019739	Finally decided to make yourself useful, huh? If you can bring the law back to Primm, we'll all be in your debt.
GID00019740	Ha! Well, you're polite, I'll give you that. If this was just between you and me, I'd do as you ask. But it's not.
GID00019741	I had a friend with me when those mutant bastards came out of nowheres. She panicked and ran the wrong direction - further into the basement.
GID00019742	She's probably dead, but I ain't leaving until I know for sure. I'd have gone looking myself, except I wouldn't last a minute out there.
GID00019743	You, on the other hand, seem pretty resourceful. Find my friend, and I'll get out of your way.
GID00019744	Then you're dumber than you look, smoothskin. Eat this!
GID00019745	First off, I'm not trapped. This was a tactical choice, all right?
GID00019746	I'm no match for those things out there, so I found a good defensive position, and I've been defending it, right?
GID00019747	...Aw, who am I fooling? I'm trapped. Name's Harland. Pleased to meet you.
GID00019748	What happened was, I was escorting folks down to work when those things attacked us.
GID00019749	Most of the fight was upstairs, but some folks panicked and made for the basement. And I went after them.
GID00019750	Well, turns out there were even more of those bastards down here than upstairs, and things went to shit fast.
GID00019751	I couldn't find the others, so I fell back to this room and set up a nice little kill zone. End of story.
GID00019752	I'm not delicate. Radroach meat for protein, condensation off the pipes for water, and I do my business over in the far corner.
GID00019753	I wouldn't say it's been comfy.
GID00019754	Guess the outfit gives that away, huh? I never did buy into that religious mumbo-jumbo with the robes and all that shit.
GID00019755	It gets lonely out in the wastes, okay? And I don't have to tell you that Bright's group has got some fine-looking ghoulettes in it!
GID00019756	Eh... or maybe I would have to tell you...
GID00019757	Anyway, I helped them out, and they kept me supplied with ammo and pleasant company.
GID00019758	I kill them on sight, so we haven't had much time to get acquainted.
GID00019759	They're hard to see, obviously, but they aren't too smart when it comes to tactics. Or not stepping in traps.
GID00019760	I'm not expecting good news, but keep looking.
GID00019761	You must mean what's left of it. Somebody's been attacking our animals at night. We're down to less than half of what we had a few weeks back.
GID00019762	Beg your pardon mister, but them two-headed beeves ain't worth getting shot over.
GID00019763	Not to mention what would happen if half of what No-bark says is true.
GID00019764	Best we can hope is that whoever's doing this'll move on, or get tired of it. I just hope it happens while we still got animals left.
GID00019765	Whoever it is, I don't think they're from around town. Seems like they've taken to shooting from the west side.
GID00019766	Beg your pardon ma'am, but them two-headed beeves ain't worth getting shot over.
GID00019767	Not to mention what would happen if half of what No-bark says is true.
GID00019768	Best we can hope is that whoever's doing this'll move on, or get tired of it. I just hope it happens while we still got animals left.
GID00019769	Whoever it is, I don't think they're from around town. Seems like they're usually shooting from the west side.
GID00019770	Losing don't describe it. It's a massacre. Few more days and there won't be nothing left to lose.
GID00019771	Well I don't know how you done it, but I do know how I can thank you. Please take this, compliments of Alice and myself.
GID00019772	And help yourself to anything in that freezer over yonder. We got more steaks in there than we'd be able to eat in a year.
GID00019773	Well we surely appreciate for what you done for us. Even without our stock, just having peace of mind means the world to us.
GID00019774	Take this, compliments of Alice and myself. We'd give you more if we could, knowing you risked your neck for us.
GID00019775	Well don't worry yourself too much over it. We'll get by.
GID00019776	We'd be grateful. Especially if you find 'em before they get my whole stock. But don't go getting yourself killed over it.
GID00019777	Alice and I'll find a way to make do. Always have.
GID00019778	Oh, I tend to my ranch, that's about it. Alice'll tell you. I don't get out a whole lot.
GID00019779	You sure, now? It's kinda hard to hear you.
GID00019780	Weird's just normal when normal decides to start taking notice of things. You just think about that.
GID00019781	Now what'd you come here for?
GID00019782	Let me know if you meet anyone suspicious.
GID00019783	We'll just see about that. You come any closer and I'm liable to stick you with my stickin' knife. Ol' Sticky's feeling mighty ornery this day.
GID00019784	Confound it, No-bark, you done it again. You let on that you know things. Now they'll never let you be.
GID00019785	All right, stranger, you got me. What do you want to know?
GID00019786	I give up! Please don't do no harm to me, mister, leastaways not my face. All I got left is my rugged good looks. What do you want to know?
GID00019787	I give up! Please don't do no harm to me, missy, leastaways not my face. All I got left is my rugged good looks. What do you want to know?
GID00019788	Okay, okay. Just speak up a little. But not so much that They hear you. They got people everywhere, always listening.
GID00019789	'Cause they know I ain't just barking here. What I say's got bite, 'cause it's the truth.
GID00019790	Them quack doctors can say what they want about all the radscorpion stings that done pierced my skull. I know what I seen.
GID00019791	I'm not sure who started it. It wasn't a very nice name, but he took to calling himself by it, so we all had to.
GID00019792	I don't even remember what his real name is.
GID00019793	Anyway, I think it comes from that expression that people say when you're crazy - that not all of your dogs are barking. Poor No-bark.
GID00019794	Molerat men, come up from the Underneath to steal young women with promises of riches and fancy mud mansions with all the latest designer appliances.
GID00019795	They covet our ladyfolk's long hair for wigs, it's said, being either bald or balding themselves.
GID00019796	I don't trust a man that doesn't have something strange going on about him, 'cause it means he's hiding it from you.
GID00019797	If a man's wearing his pants on his head or if he says his words backwards from time to time, you know it's all laid out there for you.
GID00019798	But if he's friendly to strangers and keeps his home spick-and-span, more often than not he's done something even his own ma couldn't forgive.
GID00019799	Ghosts. Commie ghosts what don't know they're dead.
GID00019800	Hoping to steal our rockets so they can fly up and paint the moon pink and draw a Lenin face on it.
GID00019801	I seen one of them disappear and reappear before my very eyes.
GID00019802	Although being a scientist, I have to admit I might've just blinked for longer than usual, what with the shock of seeing a commie ghost and so forth.
GID00019803	Seen it all. Seen shadowy folk come to his room and leave again in the middle of the night. Thought one might've gone in the lobby, too, for a spell.
GID00019804	Could be that person went in to get something. Or use the john maybe. Mighty interesting either way, you ask me.
GID00019805	I thought it was cannibals, come to eat us all for sure, so I kept out of sight. But now I know better.
GID00019806	I come face to face with the chupacabra himself one night whilst I was investigating whether this gecko was hiding his treasure from me.
GID00019807	He was the meanest, ugliest chupacabra you could imagine. Had two heads, and fangs down to the ground.
GID00019808	Best I could tell, anyways, since when he come up to me he was invisible.
GID00019809	Had himself a blunderbuss what would rotate and shoot bullets real fast out of a backpack. Never seen nothing like it.
GID00019810	Walked right past me having an argument with somebody.
GID00019811	But I only saw the one chupacabra, so I guess the other fella had to be invisible too. Only more invisible than the other one.
GID00019812	There's been things of a disturbing nature going on at the McBride Corral.
GID00019813	Seems every night one of their herd meets a most unnatural death, and always there's holes all over the body.
GID00019814	Work of the chupacabra, the livestock vampire, says No-bark, but they don't pay no mind. Too many holes, they say, and there's bullets in them.
GID00019815	Well, says No-bark, we got a chupacabra with an automatic weapon. And that's when they get real quiet, 'cause now they see the predicament we're in.
GID00019816	Folks'll tell you that they seen ghouls up near the rocket factory.
GID00019817	Sensationalist hooey, cooked up by superstitious yokels seeing phantoms of their own imagining.
GID00019818	Good idea. It ain't safe to stay on the same topic for too long.
GID00019819	I don't give my help to enemies of the NCR. Maybe you can find a raider "medic" to fix you up.
GID00019820	Yeah, and I need sterile medical supplies. But let's see what I have with me.
GID00019821	Sure.
GID00019822	I'd love to help you out, but I'm pretty strapped here as it is. I really don't have anything to sell you.
GID00019823	Hmm... well, I am better set for supplies now that you helped me out. I guess I can part with some of them.
GID00019824	Here's what I've got.
GID00019825	I suppose I have a few things around that I can spare.
GID00019826	I guess I can spare a few things.
GID00019827	...drove the raiders off. No casualties. In the meantime-
GID00019828	Patrol's back.
GID00019829	They're late. I hope they've got a good excuse.
GID00019830	What took-
GID00019831	This is a message to the NCR from the Legion.
GID00019832	We are coming for you. Run, and we will catch you. Hide, and we will find you. No matter what you do, you are all going to die.
GID00019833	We took one of the women alive.
GID00019834	Man, you name it.
GID00019835	See, I grew up in North Vegas. Me and my cousins. We were some bad seeds. Got in with a gang. I loved it.
GID00019836	Then something happened, and I couldn't handle it anymore.
GID00019837	So, I enlisted. Earned my future. Brought down my best friend to share that future with me.
GID00019838	And here was this woman who was too good for it, trying to take him away. So yeah. I didn't see eye-to-eye with the bitch.
GID00019839	Boone's a sniper, same as me. Used to spot for him when we were enlisted with the NCR.
GID00019840	After we got out, I talked him into settling down here. So, here we are.
GID00019841	I'd introduce you, but uh... we're not so friendly right now.
GID00019842	Me and his wife, we didn't see eye-to-eye on some things. We had some pretty big arguments.
GID00019843	One day she turns up missing, and he hasn't said a word to me since.
GID00019844	I understand your concern, Edgar, but the answer is no.
GID00019845	Then what do you propose? Every day that he's here, the risk increases.
GID00019846	And our chances of exposure might be one hundred percent if we act rashly.
GID00019847	Better that than not act at all!
GID00019848	No, I will not endanger the entire chapter so recklessly.
GID00019849	Look, I've made my decision. Abide by it. I have other matters to attend to.
GID00019850	You took an extreme risk in coming here. My policy towards trespassers has not been... lenient.
GID00019851	The security of this bunker is my foremost concern, and I take pains to minimize our exposure topside.
GID00019852	For this reason, I might be interested in contracting with an outsider, who can accomplish certain tasks - some basic, some a bit more... involved.
GID00019853	An NCR Ranger has begun to set up post in one of the other bunkers up top, for example. I want him driven off. Understood?
GID00019854	How do you know he won't be missed, that other rangers won't come looking for him? Or NCR patrols? Did you just make matters worse?
GID00019855	Indeed he did. The collar includes a microphone, you see. Part of the test.
GID00019856	Had you told him the location of this bunker, for example... well, let's just say we wouldn't be having this conversation.
GID00019857	Given the circumstances, termination was the best option - so your actions demonstrated loyalty, good judgment, and prowess in combat.
GID00019858	That's right. Because you did nothing to find out. Your collar was rigged with a microphone, you see. Part of the test.
GID00019859	It would seem you are a brute, but even a brute can be of use. Particularly one capable of taking down an NCR Ranger one on one.
GID00019860	Since you completed your assigned task, I will allow you to come and go from the bunker freely. So let's get that collar off you.
GID00019861	There, that's better, I hope. Now that we have that bit of unpleasantness out of the way, there is a matter that I would like to discuss with you.
GID00019862	Stop by the command room when you can. Oh, and bear in mind, if you end up betraying us, we will know it - and there will be no mercy.
GID00019863	Gone? Why did he leave? And what makes you think he won't be back?
GID00019864	Very well. I'll be interested to see how thoroughly and efficiently you carry out your mission.
GID00019865	Paladin Ramos will escort you back to the bunker's entrance and set you loose. Notice that I said "loose," not "free."
GID00019866	You are not free to carry the secret of this bunker's location beyond Hidden Valley - until I'm convinced that you're capable and dependable.
GID00019867	To underscore this point, you'll be fitted with an explosive collar. Wander off, and it will detonate. Focus on your mission, and you'll be fine.
GID00019868	Bored already? You should try living down here. Sorry, but I don't really have- oh, for Pete's sake, not again.
GID00019869	Great, looks like they're going at it again.
GID00019870	Give it a few moments. This won't take long, trust me.
GID00019871	Ha! Just having some fun with you, waster. No harm done, right? What can I do for you?
GID00019872	Exactly what powder ganger scum would say! Any last words before I pull this trigger?
GID00019873	Relax, son. Just pulling your leg. What can I do for you?
GID00019874	Relax, little lady. Just pulling your leg. What can I do for you?
GID00019875	[SUCCEEDED] Ha! Got some stones on you, son. I like that. What can I do for you?
GID00019876	[SUCCEEDED] Ha! Got some claws on you, little lady. I like that. What can I do for you?
GID00019877	[FAILED] I'll point my rifle at anything and anyone I please to! Got that, powder ganger?
GID00019878	You did not just destroy my radio.
GID00019879	You bastard! Those ghouls declared me a Saint!
GID00019880	I suppose there was always that risk. It's just that Jason was so certain...
GID00019881	You don't seem to understand how close you are to being erased from existence. Will you, or will you not comply?
GID00019882	There's nothing to talk over. You can strip down and hand over your equipment, or you can die. Will you comply?
GID00019883	I've told you what to do. Strip off your clothes and equipment, or face summary execution. Will you comply?
GID00019884	You don't. Ever. You don't even think about it.
GID00019885	Even if we did recruit trespassers, you're far too old for us. Your relationship to technology has already been perverted.
GID00019886	Okay. I'll take you to him. Follow me. Closely. Or you'll be shot.
GID00019887	[You hear nothing.]
GID00019888	[You hear nothing.]
GID00019889	[You hear nothing.]
GID00019890	[You hear nothing.]
GID00019891	[You hear static.]
GID00019892	We were getting a little worried. Where's your partner? No, on second thought, don't tell me.
GID00019893	Give your report to the Elder, then have the doc look your over. Oh, and welcome back.
GID00019894	[You hear static.]
GID00019895	Stay where you are. I'm sending someone up to meet you.
GID00019896	Yes. Permanently, I'm afraid.
GID00019897	Guess you'll be needing to find some, huh? Come back when you do.
GID00019898	One's enough to make a helping. Hand it over!
GID00019899	Hand 'em over and I'll get to baking!
GID00019900	Is that right? Then hand 'em over and I'll get to baking a whole batch of casseroles!
GID00019901	Does sound good, don't it? How many radscorpion glands you got?
GID00019902	Let's see. Been tough around here for a good while now. Worse since them thugs kidnapped our deputy.
GID00019903	It started with that breakout from the prison up the road. First there was just a few thugs rolling through town, but then they got organized.
GID00019904	Now they call themselves Powder Gangsters or something, and run around throwing dynamite and shooting people.
GID00019905	Little while ago a good chunk of them left whatever kind of organization they got up there to squeeze all the food and drink out of us they could.
GID00019906	Sure, have a look.
GID00019907	Well yes and no. My shop's got plenty of stock.
GID00019908	Problem is I ain't going into my shop until I know it's good and safe.
GID00019909	Give me a moment to get back to my shop and I'll show you my stock.
GID00019910	Things are pretty good with Meyers watching over us. I can give you a little bit of a discount.
GID00019911	Yep, and I got more ammunition now that the NCR keeps supplies flowing in.
GID00019912	On the other hand I'm payin' them NCR taxes, so now you got to as well.
GID00019913	We got rule of law again, but of the martial variety. NCR orders us around like junior soldiers. Better than lawlessness, though.
GID00019914	Got a new sheriff, as you know. Meyer's a bit rougher-hewn than I might've liked, but he seems like a good sort. So far, so good.
GID00019915	We know Primm is a great strategic point, and we aren't blind to the needs of the town, but we're barely holding our own against the Powder Gangers.
GID00019916	We don't have the guns or the personnel needed to carry out our mission, much less take on defending this town as well.
GID00019917	Have you gotten us any additional support yet?
GID00019918	Yes, I just got word of that. There's a squad of rangers standing by.
GID00019919	Sergeant McGee will take over as sheriff and the rangers will be his deputies. This town will be an NCR territory.
GID00019920	This means that aside from protection, the citizens will also need to become registered NCR citizens and pay any appropriate and associated taxes.
GID00019921	That ranger squad is still standing by, and McGee is anxious to take over as sheriff. Are you ready for me to make the call?
GID00019922	Yeah, good luck with that.
GID00019923	We were sent out here to hold back the tide of convicts from the correctional facility.
GID00019924	As you can probably tell, we aren't doing the kind of job we could be doing.
GID00019925	I'm from Hub originally, but it's been a long time since I saw it. I'm on my second tour here. Most Non-Commissioned Officers are.
GID00019926	Do you think I'm blind? Of course I can see the Powder Gangers have taken over Primm.
GID00019927	You have any other obvious facts you'd like to share? Don't fist fight with Deathclaws? No kissing Cazadores?
GID00019928	I can't imagine that deputy of theirs is worth more than a spit. I was on lookout when he got frog marched over to Bison Steve.
GID00019929	If I had a long rifle or the order I would have taken out the Powder Gangers to save him, but I didn't. His tough shit I guess.
GID00019930	I'm Manny. I'm on security detail here.
GID00019931	You see a rifle barrel sticking out of the dinosaur's mouth, you got a fifty-fifty shot it's me. Otherwise it's Boone.
GID00019932	Goddamn it. This wasn't supposed to be a guess. He might not have done a goddamn thing.
GID00019933	Goddamn it. This wasn't supposed to be a guess. She might not have done a goddamn thing.
GID00019934	Get out. I don't ever want to see you here again. And you stay the hell away from me.
GID00019935	You don't want to do that.
GID00019936	Well, that's about all the proof I could hope for, I guess. Here. This is all I can give. I think our dealings are done here.
GID00019937	I don't know. I won't be staying, I know that. Don't see much point in anything right now, except hunting legionaries.
GID00019938	Maybe I'll wander, like you.
GID00019939	Yeah. That might be true. And that's reason enough for me to take you up on it, I suppose. But this isn't gonna end well.
GID00019940	Fine. Let's get out of here.
GID00019941	No. People die out there. Often enough that no one worries about blame. They're too anxious to forget it happened in the first place, I guess.
GID00019942	Besides. I was on break when it happened.
GID00019943	Hnh. Yeah. Working on your own, you're a lot less effective. I've been there and paid for it.
GID00019944	But this isn't gonna end well.
GID00019945	You've done enough for me. What's coming next, that's something for me to deal with on my own.
GID00019946	Not unless you give me a reason.
GID00019947	Wait. You just got into town. Maybe you shouldn't go. Not just yet.
GID00019948	I guess I shouldn't be surprised. It'd be like them to keep paperwork.
GID00019949	Here. This is all I can give. I think our dealings are done here.
GID00019950	I don't have friends here.
GID00019951	I know, all right? And that's all you need to know.
GID00019952	You didn't have any proof?
GID00019953	Don't come here again till it's over.
GID00019954	There's nothing up here.
GID00019955	I think you'd better leave.
GID00019956	I don't know who you think you're kidding. I've lived here for more than a year.
GID00019957	Anyway, I need someone I can trust, and you may be a liar, but you're also a stranger. And that's a start.
GID00019958	No. No you're not, are you? Maybe you shouldn't go. Not just yet.
GID00019959	I said it was a start. This town... nobody looks me straight in the eye anymore.
GID00019960	You didn't have any proof?
GID00019961	You didn't have any proof?
GID00019962	My wife's dead. I want the son of a bitch who sold her.
GID00019963	Yeah. I guess maybe I am. But not like you.
GID00019964	Huh. Maybe it should've been you I was expecting all along.
GID00019965	Why are you here?
GID00019966	You sick bastard. You'd better be ready to join him.
GID00019967	You sick bastard. You'd better be ready to join her.
GID00019968	I want you to find something out for me. I don't know if there's anything to find, but I need someone to try.
GID00019969	My wife was taken from our home by Legion slavers one night while I was on watch.
GID00019970	They knew when to come and what route to take, and they only took Carla. Someone set it up. I don't know who.
GID00019971	Bring him out in front of the nest here while I'm on duty. I work nights.
GID00019972	I'll give you my NCR beret to put on. It'll be our signal, so I know you're standing with him.
GID00019973	And I'll take care of the rest. I need to do this myself.
GID00019974	Find out who had Carla kidnapped. Bring him out in front of the dinosaur while I'm working my shift.
GID00019975	Let me know it's him by putting on the beret I gave you. That's it. Now go on.
GID00019976	I need someone I can trust. You're a stranger. That's a start.
GID00019977	Yeah, looks that way.
GID00019978	If that doesn't work, you could always try using some chems.
GID00019979	Suits me - I've got plenty of other patients to take care of.
GID00019980	Heh. Good luck with that. Just try to remember the Cazadores crawling out of your skin aren't real.
GID00019981	But on the off chance they are, come back and see me.
GID00019982	You're making a mistake, but that's just my opinion. What do I know, after all? I've only studied medicine my entire life.
GID00019983	Suit yourself.
GID00019984	Suit yourself. But you'll find out that your habit will cost you more than that in the end.
GID00019985	Suit yourself. But you'll find out that your habit will cost you more than that in the end.
GID00019986	Suit yourself. But you'll find out that your habit will cost you more than that in the end.
GID00019987	Okay, there you are. The convulsions should stop in the next one to twelve weeks. If they don't, try holding on to something that's very still.
GID00019988	All right, there you go. And don't complain about the taste.
GID00019989	And there we go. Now, try to stay off the stuff, you hear?
GID00019990	Why didn't you say so? No problem. I'll give you my free cure. Here, lean in. It's a special doctor secret.
GID00019991	Stop doing chems!
GID00019992	Hey, I'd love to help you out of the goodness of my heart, but I have an awful lot of patients to consider.
GID00019993	There, that's got it. Do be so eager to sample dangerous substances in the future, okay?
GID00019994	Sorry, my supplies are rather limited, and we can only get more by trading. Which requires money. Money you don't have. Come back when you have some.
GID00019995	Okay... all done.
GID00019996	Come back when you actually have the money, you damn junkie.
GID00019997	Okay. Hold still. I don't want to make this any more painful than it already is.
GID00019998	Guns? I, uh, well... yeah, I guess I might have a few.
GID00019999	Darn it. No one ever buys the t-rexes.
GID00020000	Bless her. Seems like every traveler I get in here tells me the same thing.
GID00020001	They see the sign and think, gift shop? That's just too good to be true. But Jeannie May always points them back in my direction.
GID00020002	Well, a friend of Jeannie May's is a friend of mine. And my friends get a discount at my store.
GID00020003	Liar! The invoice said Stealth Boys here! Antler read it out loud to me!
GID00020004	Yeah. Twice. Actually the first time it was more like half my body. Knocked me out of the Rangers.
GID00020005	This time it's mostly just reminded me how useless I've gotten.
GID00020006	A few years back, we get a tip that some Legion slavers were holed up in this burnt out house a few klicks from where we were stationed.
GID00020007	We get there and it's deserted. No sign anyone's been there. I mean nothing. As we're leaving, I hear something behind me.
GID00020008	I turn around and there's this kid, just skin and bone, and he's looking up at us and he's scared half to death. Been hiding in a closet.
GID00020009	Be careful out there.
GID00020010	Sorry you feel that way. Then again, I'm not so sure I want to know who did this, myself.
GID00020011	Obviously you don't know the first damn thing about the Rangers. Without them, nobody in these parts would be safe.
GID00020012	No, I'm getting all worked up for nothing. Those boys are just fine.
GID00020013	Those were good men at the station. Good men. This whole town was sleeping a lot easier because of them.
GID00020014	At least they gave somebody some hell on their way out.
GID00020015	Those were good men at the station. Good men. This whole town was sleeping a lot easier because of them.
GID00020016	At least they gave somebody some hell on their way out.
GID00020017	Well, thanks for telling me. I know that knowledge didn't come without risk.
GID00020018	God damn it! I just spoke to them the other day. If this is some kind of sick joke-
GID00020019	<Sighs> Nah, that'd be too far, even for those guys.
GID00020020	Listen, this could be trouble for all of us. Whoever did this is still out there, and they might come this way.
GID00020021	If you can find out who did this, we can be better prepared to deal with them if they come through here.
GID00020022	Those were good men at the station. Good men. This whole town was sleeping a lot easier because of them.
GID00020023	Now, who knows what we're in for? The Legion? Christ, we'd be better off with Raiders.
GID00020024	Those were good men at the station. Good men. This whole town was sleeping a lot easier because of them.
GID00020025	Now, who knows what we're in for? The Legion? Christ, we'd be better off with Raiders.
GID00020026	Well, thanks for telling me. I know that knowledge didn't come without risk.
GID00020027	Heh. People don't exactly line up to find out what's in my head. Can't remember the last time someone suggested I knew something worth knowing.
GID00020028	You know, maybe there's something I can do for you. Since you've gone to all the trouble of flattering a crippled old soldier.
GID00020029	There's a move we have in the Rangers for knocking an opponent off his feet. Saved my butt a bunch of times, maybe it will for you too.
GID00020030	Let me show you how it's done.
GID00020031	Was. Was with them. That was back when my arm and leg used to work better.
GID00020032	I still like to pretend I'm a Ranger, though. I'll check in with the guys up at the station pretty regular on the ham radio.
GID00020033	Sometimes they stop by, tell me they're paying their respects, the smug bastards.
GID00020034	They haven't been responding to me, last couple of days. I guess they got tired of hearing me talk, but it's still got me a little worried.
GID00020035	Hell, listen to me talk. Like some damn mother hen.
GID00020036	Please, if you know the truth, tell me. Those guys were friends of mine.
GID00020037	Okay. Keep me posted.
GID00020038	Yes, that's Isotope-239, all right. And there's enough here to launch the rockets.
GID00020039	You already brought me the thrust control modules, so all I need now is three boxes of Sugar Bombs.
GID00020040	Yes, that's Isotope-239, all right. And there's enough here to launch the rockets.
GID00020041	Now all I need is the thrust control modules and three boxes of Sugar Bombs.
GID00020042	Let me see. Yes, that's the igniting agent! But we'll need more of these souvenirs. A total of five should do it...
GID00020043	Yes, that's Isotope-239, all right. And there's enough here to launch the rockets.
GID00020044	Yes, that's Isotope-239, all right. And there's enough here to launch the rockets.
GID00020045	Now all I need is the thrust control modules.
GID00020046	Really? I never thought I'd see the day.
GID00020047	I mean... the day I'd part with them for such an incredibly low price. With so many other offers flooding in.
GID00020048	But I like you. I think maybe it's time. All that's left is in this storage room here. You can buy the key from my store.
GID00020049	Well, let's see. Dusty McBride's been losing some Brahmin, but that's probably the heat more than anything. Honestly, it's been real quiet.
GID00020050	Ranger Andy's still hurt, but we got these two gentlemen snipers watching the road day and night, keeping the trash out of Novac.
GID00020051	They've been a blessing.
GID00020052	Oh, what am I doing? I got to thinking about making a good impression and plain forgot to tell you my name.
GID00020053	I'm Jeannie May. I take care of folks here at the motel. Long as they aren't trouble makers.
GID00020054	Well it is. Not everybody appreciates it like they oughtta.
GID00020055	Go see Cliff Briscoe at the Dino Bite Gift Shop, and tell him I sent you.
GID00020056	I think he gets lonely standing around in that dino belly all day. He'll be glad for the company.
GID00020057	Well, there's Dinky, the town mascot. He's a sight. You probably already saw him when you came in, but you can go up inside, too.
GID00020058	Up the road a ways to the west, there's REPCONN. That's the old rocket factory.
GID00020059	There's been some sinister characters out there lately, so you may want to stay clear.
GID00020060	Other than that, nothing to do but take it easy and enjoy good company.
GID00020061	We're in a little desert oasis, name of Novac. This is the Dino Dee-lite Motel, and it's mine.
GID00020062	I take no pleasure in hiding the truth from Chris. But it is the creator's will, to which I must submit.
GID00020063	I understand if that's how you feel. But keep in mind that I've been selling these for years and I'm fine.
GID00020064	I'm sure the kids that buy them are all fine too.
GID00020065	[SUCCEEDED] I, ah, well I don't really know. Would that sour you on buying one if it did?
GID00020066	Gather, all. May the creator guide my words and help me speak true...
GID00020067	The almighty creator has seen fit to answer our prayers. The time has come for us to board the rockets and begin the Great Journey.
GID00020068	Though it may seem that all humans despise us, the creator has seen fit to instruct us differently.
GID00020069	The Journey ahead would have been impossible if not for the intercession of two human friends, one new, the other a long-abiding companion.
GID00020070	But we have no hope of completing the Great Journey without your help!
GID00020071	I pray that you will reconsider, wanderer.
GID00020072	Praise the creator. Bless you, wanderer! Bless us all!
GID00020073	With the underground rid of demons, preparations for the Great Journey can resume!
GID00020074	Praise the creator. Bless you, wanderer! Bless us all!
GID00020075	As soon as the underground has been rid of demons, preparations for the Great Journey can resume!
GID00020076	Great. Here you go!
GID00020077	Really? I mean, that's great! I'm sure you'll be quite pleased with it.
GID00020078	Oh, that? It's just a bit west of Novac, up in the mountains. Lots of broken equipment and such. Place is deserted. Or used to be, I guess.
GID00020079	Lately there's been talk of ghouls up that way, but I can't rightly say whether it's so or not. If you want to know more, ask old No-bark.
GID00020080	They're scale replicas of the real thing. Very detailed. Got a liquid in them that makes them glow.
GID00020081	From what I hear, REPCONN used to give them out on tours of their HQ up in Henderson.
GID00020082	But I guess they had to stop after the first few kids thought they were filled with Nuka Cola and drank it down.
GID00020083	The papers had a name for the condition and everything. They called it the "REPCONN Shakes." Those were bad times for RobCo.
GID00020084	Well, there's t-rex figurines, of course. That's our bread and butter.
GID00020085	We also have an assortment of the REPCONN factory souvenirs - rockets, things of that nature.
GID00020086	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00020087	Yeah, I heard it too.
GID00020088	No, you just hearing things again.
GID00020089	Yeah, I hear it too.
GID00020090	Ready as I'll ever be.
GID00020091	Here it comes.
GID00020092	One more time.
GID00020093	To the Bone Orchard you go!
GID00020094	Draw, pardner!
GID00020095	Howdy, pardner!
GID00020096	I'm game.
GID00020097	Let's get this over with.
GID00020098	I'm with ya!
GID00020099	Right.
GID00020100	Got it.
GID00020101	Here I go.
GID00020102	I'm comin', too!
GID00020103	This'll be fun!
GID00020104	Been years since I did this.
GID00020105	Let's get 'em!
GID00020106	This should be over quick.
GID00020107	Leave it to me.
GID00020108	It's on.
GID00020109	Bring it on.
GID00020110	You're done for.
GID00020111	For Caesar!
GID00020112	Death to the Legion's enemies!
GID00020113	Die, Profligate!
GID00020114	I made you do this!
GID00020115	Lay into me! I deserve it!
GID00020116	Uh oh! I did something bad!
GID00020117	Take positions!
GID00020118	Flank 'em!
GID00020119	Cover me!
GID00020120	Light 'em up!
GID00020121	For the Brotherhood!
GID00020122	Got it covered.
GID00020123	Fighting's not my strong suit, but I'll see what I can do.
GID00020124	I'm on it.
GID00020125	Right with you.
GID00020126	I've got your back.
GID00020127	Sure, boss. You lead the charge, I'll follow as fast as my arthritic, rotting knees can carry me.
GID00020128	You want to send an elderly, half-decrepit ghoul into combat? Your tactical brilliance is unmatched, boss.
GID00020129	Sure thing, boss. You betcha.
GID00020130	Well now, what's all this.
GID00020131	Looks like a party.
GID00020132	Caught me good and pissed.
GID00020133	Don't worry, pumpkin, grandma's here to help!
GID00020134	Grandma's coming, babies!
GID00020135	Leo! Try not to chop our friends this time!
GID00020136	Gary!
GID00020137	Leave some for me!
GID00020138	I want to get some licks in, too!
GID00020139	Yeah, let's show them how Kings rumble.
GID00020140	Engaging.
GID00020141	Entering combat.
GID00020142	Use of force authorized.
GID00020143	I'm sorry, sir. My condensation collectors need time to fully recharge before I can continue to dispense any more beverages.
GID00020144	I'm sorry, madam. My condensation collectors need time to fully recharge before I can continue to dispense any more beverages.
GID00020145	Certainly, sir. Here you are.
GID00020146	Certainly, madam. Here you are.
GID00020147	My humor emitter array requires recharging.
GID00020148	Photons have mass? I didn't even know they were Catholic.
GID00020149	The best contraceptive for old people is nudity.
GID00020150	Two cannibals are eating a clown. One cannibal turns to the other and asks, "Does this taste funny to you?"
GID00020151	I once visited a crematorium that gave discounts for burn victims.
GID00020152	I was going to attend the clairvoyants meeting, but it was canceled due to unforeseen events.
GID00020153	It's common knowledge that irradiated cats have 18 half-lives.
GID00020154	Two atoms are in a bar. One says, "I think I lost an electron." The other says, "Are you sure?" to which the other replies, "I'm positive."
GID00020155	A neutron walks into a bar. "How much for a drink here, anyway?" To which the bartender responds, "For you, no charge."
GID00020156	War does not determine who is right - only who is left.
GID00020157	Never! Antler protects! You feel Antler's horns now!
GID00020158	A human who is friend to ghouls? Suspicious.
GID00020159	You mean the ones upstairs. Antler used intercom, told them stay put. But they want to come down in basement anyways?
GID00020160	I cannot allow. My kin are... not right in head like I am. They attack you on sight. Ghouls too. They crazy.
GID00020161	Your ghoul friends have to wait until you find what Antler brought us to get.
GID00020162	No trouble wanted? Too bad. Trouble finds you!
GID00020163	You come here for a reason, human! Antler say so!
GID00020164	You do as Antler says, or you feel Antler's horns!
GID00020165	Never! Antler protects! You feel Antler's horns now!
GID00020166	But invoice note said Stealth Boys were here! Why can't that note be true?
GID00020167	What, Antler? ...But human could be lying! Stealing the Stealth Boys for itself!
GID00020168	Oh, Antler... You trust so easy...
GID00020169	Your lucky day, human. Antler believe you. Nightkin will follow the new note to find Stealth Boys. Better be there.
GID00020170	Me? I am devoted to Antler. But before Antler? Hmm...
GID00020171	Captain, once. Last name, Davison. First name... don't remember.
GID00020172	I commanded a troop of Nightkin. The Master's elite. A great honor, very proud.
GID00020173	Something happened. We wandered the desert. Life without Master was... hard. The others' minds going strange, going crazy.
GID00020174	But then I found us new master. I find us Antler!
GID00020175	Since then, everything's been going really well.
GID00020176	A ghoul. But not squishy like others. This ghoul is tough.
GID00020177	I thought Antler said send my kin into that room, but three died. Ghoul is a crack shot and set traps too.
GID00020178	After, I realize I heard Antler wrong. So I lock the door to keep kin out and wait for Antler to tell me what to do.
GID00020179	Then you come along. Antler says you are solution.
GID00020180	Pay attention when I speak! I said ghoul is a crack shot and sets traps!
GID00020181	Too dangerous for us. Okay for you.
GID00020182	Good. Antler brought us here for a reason... Why was that, Antler?
GID00020183	Right! A piece of paper. Shipment invoice. Hundreds of Stealth Boys, sent here a long time ago...
GID00020184	But Stealth Boys must be in the one room one we don't search yet - the one we can't search.
GID00020185	Told you already. Antler wants Nightkin to have all the Stealth Boys in the bad room. With the ghoul.
GID00020186	What you saying, human?
GID00020187	Yes, Antler says we leave here as soon as we get Stealth Boys.
GID00020188	Let me give you key. Antler had me lock the door. The ghoul inside not expecting a human. Maybe he don't shoot you. Maybe he will.
GID00020189	Yes, Antler says we leave here as soon as we get Stealth Boys.
GID00020190	Let me give you key. Antler had me lock the door. The ghoul inside not expecting a human. Maybe he don't shoot you. Maybe he will.
GID00020191	Keep looking... Antler wants Nightkin to have them.
GID00020192	Find them or Antler's horns find you.
GID00020193	On it!
GID00020194	I'm with you!
GID00020195	Okay, I guess.
GID00020196	Kind of bored, actually.
GID00020197	I don't know. Fine, I guess.
GID00020198	I feel kind of sick. Maybe I shouldn't have eaten that lizard.
GID00020199	Do you ever dream about monsters? I do.
GID00020200	I don't know. What about you?
GID00020201	Just hanging around. What's up with you?
GID00020202	Hanging around this boring place, as usual.
GID00020203	Nothing. I'm bored.
GID00020204	I don't know.
GID00020205	Um. I can't remember.
GID00020206	Well... I guess I could make an exception. 50 caps -- but that's my final offer.
GID00020207	All right. But don't let it get around, or I'll have every dirty waster begging me for help.
GID00020208	Fine. 100 it is. But don't think this makes us friends. This is a special, one-time offer, understand?
GID00020209	Sir, I regret to inform you that this unit cannot accept orders from an irresponsible officer!
GID00020210	It is a soldier's duty to soldier, not to play hero!
GID00020211	Sir, I regret to inform you that this unit cannot accept orders from an officer under a Court Martial!
GID00020212	Sir, I apologize, but a squad is less effective when it is over crowded.
GID00020213	Huh. Well, let me know when there's room for me.
GID00020214	I'm ready when you are.
GID00020215	Sorry boss, but as much as I'd like to risk getting killed by your side, you seem to already have some help.
GID00020216	You have quite the menagerie at your disposal. If you can get the posse down to "small gang" size, I'll happily go with you.
GID00020217	As the old saying goes, two's company, but three's a small army. Okay, I'm paraphrasing a bit, but you get the idea.
GID00020218	There's something about that robot that doesn't seem... all right to me. I'm not saying we shouldn't take it with us.
GID00020219	I'm just saying that if it were to "fall" into Lake Mead and be irreparably damaged... and if you threw an EMP grenade in after it...
GID00020220	Well, there are worse things happening in the world, right?
GID00020221	After spending thirty years of my life hiding my association with the Enclave, I'd love to stroll the wasteland with a twitchy Eyebot.
GID00020222	Back in your good graces again? I knew you'd see the light.
GID00020223	A courier, doctor, and a cybernetic dog. After we deal with the whole "imminent conquest of New Vegas" problem, we should open an act at the Tops.
GID00020224	Words cannot contain my excitement at the chance to throw myself headlong into danger with you again, boss.
GID00020225	Let's go make trouble.
GID00020226	Ooo. Sorry. Don't want to be a third wheel, you know?
GID00020227	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00020228	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00020229	[Rex growls at ED-E's presence.]
GID00020230	<bark! bark!>
GID00020231	Can't be any worse than here.
GID00020232	All right then, let's get the train rolling.
GID00020233	You got one too many by my count.
GID00020234	Not in the mood for a threesome. Today.
GID00020235	What, you teasing me? Lose one, then ask me again.
GID00020236	That'd be lovely, dearie.
GID00020237	Oh no, dearie, three makes a crowd.
GID00020238	No time to dilly-dally, sir! What is it?
GID00020239	Old war-bots never die! We just rust away.
GID00020240	You wanna do something different?
GID00020241	Oh, this should be good. I mean, what's on your mind, boss?
GID00020242	I'll defer to your judgment, naturally.
GID00020243	Am I punching too much? I get carried away.
GID00020244	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00020245	<aroo?>
GID00020246	I'm listening.
GID00020247	Tactics ain't the word I'd use.
GID00020248	So talk then.
GID00020249	Got my attention.
GID00020250	Of course, dearie, I'll do whatever you want. I can't make any promises about Leo, though.
GID00020251	If you think it'll help.
GID00020252	I'll do my best.
GID00020253	In what way, boss?
GID00020254	My recommendation - more punching.
GID00020255	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00020256	<aroo?>
GID00020257	My style suits me just fine. But go ahead anyway.
GID00020258	Well, we all ain't got Pip-VATS on our wrists.
GID00020259	You expecting a fight?
GID00020260	Ohhh, Leo might not like that, but I'll try, sweetheart.
GID00020261	No arguing here.
GID00020262	As long as we're not here all day.
GID00020263	Long as it's not a lecture.
GID00020264	I'm listening.
GID00020265	Not a problem.
GID00020266	I'm listening.
GID00020267	Whatever you say, boss.
GID00020268	Yeah. Shake things up a little.
GID00020269	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00020270	<pant pant>
GID00020271	Whatever you like, dearie.
GID00020272	Right behind you.
GID00020273	You got it.
GID00020274	After you.
GID00020275	Count me in.
GID00020276	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00020277	<bark!>
GID00020278	Let's hit the road.
GID00020279	Road's not getting any shorter.
GID00020280	All right, let's get this caravan rolling.
GID00020281	Don't you want to give grandma some sugar first?
GID00020282	Not my strong suit, but okay.
GID00020283	Right. Got it. I'll just stop using this melee weapon and instead use a melee weapon. Good idea, boss.
GID00020284	If you would like me to die very rapidly, this is clearly the best tactical choice.
GID00020285	Sure, I'll stop using my rather effective gun and switch to, ah, this piece of metal tubing here. Great plan, boss.
GID00020286	You mean like this melee weapon right here in my hand at this very second?
GID00020287	Yes! Finally. Everything's coming up Veronica.
GID00020288	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00020289	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00020290	[Rex defaults to melee attacks since he has no ranged weapons.]
GID00020291	All right. <Cracks knuckles>
GID00020292	As long as I'm not bringing a knife to a shootout.
GID00020293	Good, my fists were getting bored.
GID00020294	Gives me a chance to practice my backhand.
GID00020295	Throw some whiskey in the mix, and I'm game.
GID00020296	Time to make some new friends.
GID00020297	Oh dearie me, I thought I already was! Have I been confused all this time?
GID00020298	Oh, I'm so glad, peanut. Leo finds chopping people so much easier.
GID00020299	Yeah, you and me both.
GID00020300	You mean like the one I'm already using, boss?
GID00020301	No arguments from me.
GID00020302	Sure thing, boss.
GID00020303	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00020304	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00020305	Does jumping at them with my fists count as ranged? <Sighs> Fine.
GID00020306	Are you talking to me, or a future Veronica who is not already doing that?
GID00020307	[Rex is incapable of ranged attacks and will continue using melee attacks.]
GID00020308	Could use a little target practice.
GID00020309	Music to my ears.
GID00020310	Dad'd approve.
GID00020311	Line the bottles up, I'm ready.
GID00020312	Well, if you insist, but Leo isn't going to like it much.
GID00020313	Now now, dearie, there's no need to repeat yourself. Grandma hears just fine.
GID00020314	What, I got whiskey on my breath?
GID00020315	Look, if you ripped one, I don't care.
GID00020316	Washed a hundred times, Brahmin smell never gets out.
GID00020317	Sorry - travelling the Mojave don't exactly leave me smelling like a rose.
GID00020318	Just tell me where you want me.
GID00020319	We can do that.
GID00020320	What are you saying, exactly?
GID00020321	Am I stepping on your shoes or something, boss?
GID00020322	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00020323	<pant pant>
GID00020324	What's the matter, dearie? Afraid grandma will embarass you in front of your little friends?
GID00020325	What's the matter, dearie? Do you miss having grandma close by?
GID00020326	Any closer and you'd need a Rad-Away, boss.
GID00020327	Okay, I'll keep it tight.
GID00020328	I'm not going to wander off, but okay.
GID00020329	Hey, now. You're gonna have to buy me dinner first.
GID00020330	This is as close as I get until you turn into a leggy brunette.
GID00020331	Sorry. I get distracted. Been scavenging too long.
GID00020332	Oh, I wouldn't dream of getting too far away, boss.
GID00020333	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00020334	<bark!>
GID00020335	About as close as I can get without crawling up your ass.
GID00020336	Any closer, I'm stepping in your boots.
GID00020337	Already am... 'less you're getting fresh on me.
GID00020338	Gonna need a wedding ring first.
GID00020339	Sorry, was lagging behind there.
GID00020340	Keep your shirt on, I'm coming.
GID00020341	All right, I'll rein it in.
GID00020342	Bringing up the rear.
GID00020343	If I get any closer, I might squish you! And that would make grandma sad.
GID00020344	Aww, someone misses grandma!
GID00020345	I'm always eager for more of your scintillating conversation, boss.
GID00020346	Okay.
GID00020347	I'm listening.
GID00020348	See? I'm good at stuff.
GID00020349	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00020350	<pant pant>
GID00020351	What now?
GID00020352	Let's hear it.
GID00020353	What can grandma do for her little pumpkin?
GID00020354	Let's go.
GID00020355	Got it.
GID00020356	Good talk.
GID00020357	Right behind you, boss.
GID00020358	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00020359	<bark!>
GID00020360	Grandma's right behind you, sugar!
GID00020361	Sounds good to me.
GID00020362	All right, enough jabbering.
GID00020363	That's what I do best.
GID00020364	They'll never see the haymakers coming.
GID00020365	Wherever you want me. No problem.
GID00020366	You mean like the last time you told me to do that, boss?
GID00020367	Got it. I'll be way back here, boss.
GID00020368	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00020369	<bark! bark!>
GID00020370	Like your thinking.
GID00020371	Sweetie, I think knows a little something about chopping evil people. That's what I've been doing.
GID00020372	All right, dear, grandma will stay out of your way - but I'll be close enough to hear if you call!'
GID00020373	All right.
GID00020374	Yeah. Screw them.
GID00020375	Let me know if you need anything else.
GID00020376	Don't strain yourself, boss.
GID00020377	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00020378	<pant pant>
GID00020379	Fine, let's focus on the bad guys.
GID00020380	Waste of time, anyway.
GID00020381	Fine. All this planning won't matter much when the bullets fly, anyway.
GID00020382	He's making a move! Stop him!
GID00020383	She's making a move! Stop her!
GID00020384	Coward!
GID00020385	All right, I'll just get my scalpel here, and... ugh. Did I leave that sitting outside? Well, you know what? Free tetanus shot!
GID00020386	Okay. Hold still.
GID00020387	Okay, that's about the best I can do. Try not to get hurt that bad again, it's not like I've got an endless supply of bandages.
GID00020388	All right, just hold steady. Want a shot of whiskey to calm your nerves? Mind if I have one? Heh heh, little doctor humor there.
GID00020389	Darn it! That money was going to help pay to get me some medical training.
GID00020390	Well, come back when you do. I'll be here.
GID00020391	Then I'm sorry, but I don't have any treatment for you. My priority is helping the refugees here at this camp.
GID00020392	Then I can't help you much. Now, maybe if you enlisted....
GID00020393	This might take a while. Close your eyes and try to relax, and we'll begin.
GID00020394	I'm afraid protocol prevents me from treating you then.
GID00020395	This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
GID00020396	This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
GID00020397	For crying out loud. Get out of my face then.
GID00020398	All right, I'll just get my scalpel here, and... ugh. Did I leave that sitting outside? Well, you know what? Free tetanus shot!
GID00020399	Okay. Hold still.
GID00020400	Darn it! That money was going to help pay to get me some medical training.
GID00020401	Well, come back when you do. I'll be here.
GID00020402	Okay, that's about the best I can do. Try not to get hurt that bad again, it's not like I've got an endless supply of bandages.
GID00020403	Then I'm sorry, but I don't have any treatment for you. My priority is helping the refugees here at this camp.
GID00020404	All right, just hold steady. Want a shot of whiskey to calm your nerves? Mind if I have one? Heh heh, little doctor humor there.
GID00020405	Then I can't help you much. Now, maybe if you enlisted....
GID00020406	This shouldn't take too long. Just close your eyes and relax.
GID00020407	I'm afraid protocol prevents me from treating you then.
GID00020408	This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
GID00020409	This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
GID00020410	For crying out loud. Get out of my face then.
GID00020411	Glad to be able to help.
GID00020412	Yeah? What is it?
GID00020413	Go! Go! Go!
GID00020414	Take positions!
GID00020415	Get back!
GID00020416	Darn it...
GID00020417	What a waste...
GID00020418	Meaner than a rattlesnake, ain't ya?
GID00020419	Goldurnit!
GID00020420	Damn it to hell!
GID00020421	You'll pay for that!
GID00020422	Damn...
GID00020423	Shame...
GID00020424	Goddamn it!
GID00020425	Blast it!
GID00020426	God dammit...
GID00020427	You'll pay for that...
GID00020428	You'll pay for that!
GID00020429	Fucker!
GID00020430	Now you've gone and done it.
GID00020431	Man down!
GID00020432	You'll pay for that!
GID00020433	Press on!
GID00020434	Keep fighting!
GID00020435	Rest in peace, Brother.
GID00020436	You will be avenged, Brother.
GID00020437	Damn it!
GID00020438	Man down!
GID00020439	Ah, hell.
GID00020440	Dammit!
GID00020441	Et in Arcadia ego.
GID00020442	Oh! Dammit.
GID00020443	Well, crap.
GID00020444	Damn!
GID00020445	Their trouble's all gone.
GID00020446	Gone to their reward.
GID00020447	Running out of friends...
GID00020448	One of ours is down!
GID00020449	Wake up, sleepyhead! Wake up? ...Please?
GID00020450	Oh, no! Grandma's little pumpkin! Rraaaargh!
GID00020451	We've got a man down here!
GID00020452	Man down!
GID00020453	Engaging!
GID00020454	Go, go, go!
GID00020455	Time to die, Outsider!
GID00020456	Damn, there goes a big earner.
GID00020457	Fuck, that's not good.
GID00020458	I'm gonna kick your ass.
GID00020459	You wanna piece of this?
GID00020460	Let's get this goin'.
GID00020461	Hm.
GID00020462	Hey!
GID00020463	You'll pay for that!
GID00020464	Bastard!
GID00020465	Think you can take me down too?
GID00020466	I'm going to blow you to pieces.
GID00020467	Stupid shit.
GID00020468	Oh yeah! That means more for me.
GID00020469	Let's rock.
GID00020470	I'm going to make you bleed.
GID00020471	Alright, its on now!
GID00020472	Keep fighting!
GID00020473	Press on!
GID00020474	Die, Profligate!
GID00020475	Death to the Legion's enemies!
GID00020476	For Caesar!
GID00020477	Man down!
GID00020478	You bastard!
GID00020479	I'll kill you for that!
GID00020480	No!
GID00020481	Made me mad now!
GID00020482	Try killing me!
GID00020483	You die next!
GID00020484	Partner unit disabled.
GID00020485	Destruction of law officers is a capital offense.
GID00020486	This can't be happening!
GID00020487	Please no!
GID00020488	They killed him!
GID00020489	They killed her!
GID00020490	Look out!
GID00020491	We'll get 'em.
GID00020492	Flank 'em!
GID00020493	Signing off.
GID00020494	<Singing>
GID00020495	<Singing>
GID00020496	<Singing>
GID00020497	<Singing>
GID00020498	Rangers, this is the chief. I know I can ramble on sometimes, but I need you to listen close for the next minute or so. I've got some bad news.
GID00020499	I messed up. Made a mistake. I thought I could help get us out of here, but... it didn't work out.
GID00020500	Rangers get injured all the time. It's part of the job. But if you lose a few fingers, get a bad break, that's it. You step down.
GID00020501	We rely on each other too much to let our infirmities become a liability. A ranger knows when it's time. Only I didn't.
GID00020502	Somewhere along the way, something broke inside me. I couldn't find us a way out of this desert. I wrestled with it, and it took me down a dark road.
GID00020503	I wish I could explain it to you. The old chief's finally at a loss for words.
GID00020504	Send me all the Legion you can. I'll be waiting for them.
GID00020505	Grandma's here! Grandma's here!
GID00020506	Oh, my goodness, look at these little angels! Becky, that dress looks so lovely! And Jimmy, my word how you've grown!
GID00020507	I'm four whole feet, grandma!
GID00020508	Did you bring us presents, grandma?
GID00020509	Well, now, I don't know... have you been good for your mommy and daddy?
GID00020510	Yes!
GID00020511	Well, then, let grandma see what she's got....
GID00020527	Bravo, come in, Bravo. Is anyone out there?
GID00020528	The camp was attacked. I think I'm the only one left alive.
GID00020529	We were attacked by some kind of freak mutants from the caves. Please send backup!
GID00020530	God damn leg... I don't know how much longer I'm going to make it before I bleed out.
GID00020531	Bravo, this is Camp Guardian calling for backup. No sign of the rest of the men stationed here.
GID00020532	This is Private Halford requesting backup. Anyone out there?
GID00020533	Guardian is down. I repeat Guardian is down. Requesting backup from any nearby forces.
GID00020534	Those beasts drug the rest of the men away. Oh God, I hope they don't come back for me.
GID00020535	Uh... Am I broadcasting? I'm broadcasting? Shit, ok. This is the NCR Emergency channel. It sounds like the Hoover Dam is under attack. Stay tuned.
GID00020536	Rangers have managed to hold off a Legion attack at Camp Golf. Some casualties, but Camp Golf stands.
GID00020537	Rangers have barely managed to fend off a brutal attack at Camp Golf. The numbers had not yet been reinforced to replace the missing troops.
GID00020538	Camp Golf has fallen! Apparently a small group of troopers broke rank and fled their posts once the battle began.
GID00020539	A group of troopers, that can only be described as rag-tag, managed to fend off a brutal attack at Camp Golf. I salute your bravery. Hold the front.
GID00020540	Troopers have managed to contain several small riots that were breaking out in the area surrounding New Vegas.
GID00020541	There is chaos breaking out at McCarran. The Fiends are using the opportunity to attack the base.
GID00020542	There are also several riots breaking out in the area surrounding New Vegas. The looters have taken to the streets.
GID00020543	There is a confirmed report that the Legion mounted a simultaneous assault at Camp Forlorn Hope.
GID00020544	Yes Forlorn Hope has fallen. Some troops managed to fall back, but the fortification is lost.
GID00020545	Forlorn Hope has sustained heavy casualties, but the fortification stands. We have successfully defended Forlorn Hope.
GID00020546	I'm not getting any more information from Forlorn Hope. The Camp appears to have been totally overrun.
GID00020547	I'm receiving reports that Forlorn Hope has been totally overrun, and the Legion is killing civilians as far as the township called Novac.
GID00020548	The troops at Forlorn Hope, assisted by First Recon, have repelled the Legion attack with very few casualties.
GID00020549	The troops at Forlorn Hope, assisted by First Recon, have repelled the Legion in what will surely be the most decisive victory in this entire battle.
GID00020550	What the fuck is happening on the Strip? I'm getting reports that someone just bombed the embassy.
GID00020551	It sounds like the Omertas are mounting some sort of attack on the Strip. They are receiving heavy casualties from the Securitrons and other casinos.
GID00020552	The attack is coming from the Omertas. They are using some kind of gas to kill everyone in the casinos on the strip. How is this possible?
GID00020553	The monorail at Camp McCarran just exploded. I'm not getting any reports of any fighting, but the monorail is gone for sure.
GID00020554	We aren't going to be able to reinforce the Strip against the Omerta assault there. How the fuck did this happen? Jesus.
GID00020555	There is some sort of obstruction on the road to Hoover Dam. We're going to do our best to send reinforcements around.
GID00020556	Deploying battalion 14 to the southwestern flank.
GID00020557	Unit 15 reinforce unit 16 at defense point sigma delta.
GID00020558	Delta squad, redeploy.
GID00020559	All units, be aware we are receiving help from a non-NCR military asset.
GID00020560	Snipers in position. Repeat. Snipers in position.
GID00020561	Unit 4 reinforce unit 8.
GID00020562	Unit 23 await reinforcement from unit 42.
GID00020563	Location Bravo Bravo Charlie, the doctor is coming.
GID00020564	All unit commands, relay your current position and status.
GID00020565	They're coming out of the walls man! They're coming outta the damn walls.
GID00020566	Game Over Man! GAME OVER!
GID00020567	That just ain't necessary
GID00020568	Kids today.
GID00020569	Looks like we got us a ruckus.
GID00020570	Well look at them carrying on.
GID00020571	I'm not taking sides.
GID00020572	Whoa!
GID00020573	Whoa, what's going on?
GID00020574	Hey, I'm not a part of this.
GID00020575	Look at 'em go!
GID00020576	Get 'em! Yeah!
GID00020577	Keep me out of this!
GID00020578	Not my problem.
GID00020579	Hey, some entertainment, finally.
GID00020580	Hey, cool. A fight.
GID00020581	Pointless.
GID00020582	Not my fight.
GID00020583	I'm not touching that one with a ten-foot pole.
GID00020584	You can get involved if you want to, but I'll be over here.
GID00020585	No need to get into that mess, sweetheart!
GID00020586	No, Leo, we won't go over there and start chopping! No!
GID00020587	If there's one thing there's no shortage of in the Mojave, it's violence.
GID00020588	It would be nice if things could stop tearing each other apart around here.
GID00020589	Had it coming.
GID00020590	Fight!
GID00020591	They hardly even know how to fight.
GID00020592	Let them fight it out among themselves.
GID00020593	Assault noted. Considering intervention.
GID00020594	An assault has been noted. Analyzing.
GID00020595	This should be interesting.
GID00020596	Barbarians.
GID00020597	So much violence in the world these days.
GID00020598	Look out!
GID00020599	Fight!
GID00020600	Whoa!
GID00020601	Watch out!
GID00020602	Let me know if you need anything else.
GID00020603	Thanks.
GID00020604	Give me a shout if you need anything else.
GID00020605	Another satisfied customer.
GID00020606	Pleasure doing business with you.
GID00020607	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00020608	You're done hidin'!
GID00020609	Shoulda gone quietly.
GID00020610	Knew it!
GID00020611	Draw, pardner!
GID00020612	Prepare to run against the pill!
GID00020613	Yeehaw!
GID00020614	Got ya!
GID00020615	Knew you'd turn up sooner or later.
GID00020616	Ah, there you are!
GID00020617	There you are.
GID00020618	Let's finish what we started.
GID00020619	Nice try.
GID00020620	There ya are!
GID00020621	Couldn't hide, could ya?
GID00020622	Got my eye on you now!
GID00020623	You're mine!
GID00020624	Now it ends!
GID00020625	Got 'em!
GID00020626	Found you!
GID00020627	There you are!
GID00020628	Here we go!
GID00020629	There you are!
GID00020630	There you are!
GID00020631	I found you!
GID00020632	I see you!
GID00020633	You're mine!
GID00020634	You can't escape my True Eyes!
GID00020635	Found the hostile!
GID00020636	The target's over here!
GID00020637	There you are!
GID00020638	Visual confirmation made.
GID00020639	Target reacquired!
GID00020640	Target reacquired!
GID00020641	Over there!
GID00020642	I see 'em!
GID00020643	Oh! There we go!
GID00020644	Busted!
GID00020645	Found 'em!
GID00020646	There we go!
GID00020647	Couldn't even hide from a half-blind old ghoul. How embarassing for you.
GID00020648	Got 'em, boss!
GID00020649	All right, let's try this again.
GID00020650	Got 'em!
GID00020651	Gonna kill you for wasting my time.
GID00020652	Should've run, now say your prayers.
GID00020653	There they are! Get them, Leo!
GID00020654	We found you!
GID00020655	You can't hide from your paddling!
GID00020656	I got you now!
GID00020657	Let's do this!
GID00020658	It's on!
GID00020659	You thought you could lay low?
GID00020660	I'm gonna grease you good.
GID00020661	There you are.
GID00020662	Haha, Gary!
GID00020663	Hooo, Gaary!
GID00020664	Ah hah!
GID00020665	Got you now!
GID00020666	Now you die!
GID00020667	Not so sneaky, are we?
GID00020668	Gotcha!
GID00020669	There you are!
GID00020670	Couldn't run forever...
GID00020671	Nowhere to run now!
GID00020672	I knew I'd find your bitch ass.
GID00020673	You're dead now.
GID00020674	I'm not going to let you get away.
GID00020675	You're mine!
GID00020676	I see you!
GID00020677	I found you!
GID00020678	Ah, there you are!
GID00020679	I've found the enemy!
GID00020680	You'll have to hide better than that!
GID00020681	Hide from this!
GID00020682	Made me look! Made me mad!
GID00020683	No - more - hiding!
GID00020684	Target found.
GID00020685	Target reacquired.
GID00020686	Target found. Engaging.
GID00020687	Target lock status: green. Reengaging hostile target.
GID00020688	Hostile target detected. Target lock status: green.
GID00020689	Target lock acquired. Resuming lethal force neutralization operation.
GID00020690	Were you trying to hide from me?
GID00020691	You'll find that my electronic sensors are quite sophisticated.
GID00020692	My search routines are quite advanced, don't you think?
GID00020693	Fugitive has been located. Commencing attack.
GID00020694	Your attempted escape is only making things worse for you.
GID00020695	Do not make any further escape attempts, lawbreaker.
GID00020696	You cannot hide from me, you commie maggot!
GID00020697	You can run, but you can't hide!
GID00020698	Your worthless hide is mine!
GID00020699	You can't hide from me.
GID00020700	Aha!
GID00020701	Thought hiding would save you?
GID00020702	There you are!
GID00020703	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00020704	Hard to believe I scared somebody off.
GID00020705	Up and left on me.
GID00020706	Gone now...
GID00020707	Seems they made like a ghost.
GID00020708	It would appear they skedaddled.
GID00020709	I guess I run them off.
GID00020710	Damn, guess they're gone.
GID00020711	Long gone by now.
GID00020712	Fine, stay hidden for all I care.
GID00020713	Dammit. Got away.
GID00020714	Maybe next time.
GID00020715	Ah, to hell with this.
GID00020716	I ain't chasin' 'em.
GID00020717	This is too much runnin' for an old man.
GID00020718	Someone younger can run after 'em.
GID00020719	Must be gone by now...
GID00020720	Not really worth looking for anyway.
GID00020721	Okay, I give up.
GID00020722	Fine. I'll get your ass next time.
GID00020723	Next time, then.
GID00020724	Shit. Guess I lost 'em.
GID00020725	Let's bounce, boys.
GID00020726	Guess he's gone.
GID00020727	Guess she's gone.
GID00020728	I'll kill them if they come back.
GID00020729	I scared them away. No match for the Legion.
GID00020730	The True Eyes show me the intruder is gone.
GID00020731	Stand down. The hostile's gone.
GID00020732	Must've scared them off.
GID00020733	Call off the search. They got away.
GID00020734	Damn it, they're not here.
GID00020735	All clear.
GID00020736	Gone for now.
GID00020737	Gone. Huh.
GID00020738	I guess they're gone. Probably for the best.
GID00020739	Got away.
GID00020740	I give up.
GID00020741	Probably die of natural causes eventually anyway.
GID00020742	Ah, screw it.
GID00020743	Maybe they just... went home, huh boss?
GID00020744	I got nothing, here.
GID00020745	Doubtless they ran away in sheer terror of the mighty Raul! Oh, and you too, boss.
GID00020746	Guess they got rattled.
GID00020747	Get 'em next time.
GID00020748	Got no patience for hunting.
GID00020749	If they come back, Leo will be waiting!
GID00020750	It's probably best to leave well enough alone, dearie.
GID00020751	The bad men have all gone away, sweetness. Grandma's here to protect you.
GID00020752	I guess the outsider left.
GID00020753	I bet the coward ran back to those NCR fools.
GID00020754	Guess they're too scared to fight.
GID00020755	I got you next time.
GID00020756	Be glad I didn't find your punk ass.
GID00020757	Fuck this, I got shit to do.
GID00020758	Gary? Gary?
GID00020759	Maybe stupid head voice was right?
GID00020760	Was definitely there. Not crazy.
GID00020761	You come back, I kill you.
GID00020762	All right, I'm offically saying screw this.
GID00020763	Let's go home, boys.
GID00020764	This is dullsville. Let's bounce.
GID00020765	Let's go do something else.
GID00020766	You're not worth my time.
GID00020767	What a punk.
GID00020768	Chicken ass.
GID00020769	Time to find some more psycho.
GID00020770	I scared them away. No match for the Legion.
GID00020771	I'll kill them if they come back.
GID00020772	It seems they ran off.
GID00020773	They're gone. No sense in looking any more.
GID00020774	We're wasting time. Call off the search.
GID00020775	This is a waste of time.
GID00020776	Hmph, they're long gone.
GID00020777	Stupid hider.
GID00020778	Hmph. Tired of looking.
GID00020779	Fine! Hide for all I care!
GID00020780	Search operations suspended. Have a nice day.
GID00020781	Canceling search. Have a nice day.
GID00020782	Halting search. Have a nice day.
GID00020783	Threat analysis: green. Perimeter secure. Resuming standard operations.
GID00020784	Threat analysis: green. Perimeter secure.
GID00020785	Threat analysis: green. No hostiles detected.
GID00020786	Oh well. I wish you hadn't left so soon. I was having such a good time with you.
GID00020787	I'll miss you. Please come back and see me again.
GID00020788	I hope I didn't hurt your feelings with all that shooting and flaming. I'm afraid it's just the way I was programmed.
GID00020789	Hostile has escaped. Transmitting description to designated law enforcement authorities.
GID00020790	Fugitive has evaded pursuit. Law enforcement authorities now have primary responsibility for apprehension.
GID00020791	Search complete. No hostiles detected. Standing down.
GID00020792	Typical chickenshit commie maneuver.
GID00020793	The enemy has retired before the awesome might of the U.S. army.
GID00020794	This battlefield now belongs to Uncle Sam!
GID00020795	I can't find anything.
GID00020796	Hmm. Oh well.
GID00020797	Must have got away.
GID00020798	Guess she's gone.
GID00020799	Guess he's gone.
GID00020800	Huh. Looks like they left.
GID00020801	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00020802	Coulda sworn you was here!
GID00020803	Nuts! You was just here...
GID00020804	Gave me the slip.
GID00020805	Come on now and fight honorable like?
GID00020806	Quit your hidin' and fight!
GID00020807	Pony up, now! Lord hates a coward.
GID00020808	Where'd you go?
GID00020809	Hmph. Tricky little bastard, ain't ya?
GID00020810	I know you're still out there.
GID00020811	Come out, finish this!
GID00020812	I know you're still out there.
GID00020813	Where the hell did you go?
GID00020814	Where are ya?
GID00020815	Strange... Ain't there no more.
GID00020816	Where'd you go?
GID00020817	You won't get away!
GID00020818	Damn, lost 'em!
GID00020819	I'm not done with you!
GID00020820	Where the fuck are you?
GID00020821	Quit playin' games!
GID00020822	Come out here and fight!
GID00020823	Don't think you can just up and run away.
GID00020824	Where'd you go?
GID00020825	I'll find you!
GID00020826	You won't escape me!
GID00020827	You can't hide from me!
GID00020828	Where'd they go, Rhonda?
GID00020829	I've lost visual. Moving to pursue.
GID00020830	Target lost. Begin full grid search.
GID00020831	Does anyone see the hostile?
GID00020832	Where'd he go?
GID00020833	Where'd she go?
GID00020834	Think you can hide, huh?
GID00020835	Lost contact!
GID00020836	I don't see 'em!
GID00020837	Still around here somewhere.
GID00020838	Where'd they go?
GID00020839	Lost 'em.
GID00020840	Where the hell?
GID00020841	Hey! Come out and fight!
GID00020842	Oh, come on, don't make the old guy chase you!
GID00020843	I can't see 'em!
GID00020844	Boss, where'd he go?
GID00020845	Hide nor hair of them.
GID00020846	Fucker pops back up, they'll wish they hadn't.
GID00020847	Picked the wrong time for hide and seek.
GID00020848	Where'd you go?
GID00020849	Grandma will find them, sugar, don't you worry!
GID00020850	Do you see them, Leo? I don't see them!
GID00020851	Show yourself, Outsider.
GID00020852	Come out, come out, wherever you are.
GID00020853	We'll find ya' one way or another.
GID00020854	Do you think you can hide from me?
GID00020855	You're gonna pay for that when I find you.
GID00020856	Where the fuck did you go?
GID00020857	Huhn?! Gary!
GID00020858	Where are you?
GID00020859	You're out there!
GID00020860	Not crazy! You out there!
GID00020861	Where'd you go? I ain't done with you.
GID00020862	Don't think you can get away.
GID00020863	Whoa. Spooky.
GID00020864	Must've blinked or something.
GID00020865	That's right. Run!
GID00020866	I can smell your fear.
GID00020867	Don't think I don't know where you are.
GID00020868	You'd better hide.
GID00020869	You can't hide from me!
GID00020870	You won't escape me!
GID00020871	I'll find you!
GID00020872	Damn, this one's tricky!
GID00020873	Be on your guard! The enemy is still here!
GID00020874	Damn! Lost 'em!
GID00020875	Huh? Where'd you go?
GID00020876	Not fair! Haven't killed you yet!
GID00020877	Get out here! Not done with you!
GID00020878	Target lost. Searching.
GID00020879	Target lost. Attempting to reacquire.
GID00020880	Target lost. Analyzing.
GID00020881	Alert. Target lock lost. Beginning search pattern delta seven.
GID00020882	Alert. Target lock lost. Neutralization by lethal force remains primary objective.
GID00020883	Alert. Target lock lost. Unneutralized hostile within perimeter.
GID00020884	Where did you go? Was it something I said?
GID00020885	I'm coming to find you now. I'm afraid my programming does not allow me to let you get away.
GID00020886	You're behaving very rudely. I wouldn't hide from you, if our positions were reversed.
GID00020887	Do not attempt to flee. You will be identified and sanctioned.
GID00020888	Fugitive is attempting to evade capture. Beginning pursuit.
GID00020889	Initiating search for hostile target.
GID00020890	Just what I was hoping for. Trundling around looking for something that wants to blow me to flinders.
GID00020891	Must we play hide and seek now?
GID00020892	Ready or not, here I come!
GID00020893	That's a good start. Now just keep running and we'll call it even.
GID00020894	Somebody find me something to shoot at!
GID00020895	Who's got a target?
GID00020896	Restore contact with the enemy, goddammit!
GID00020897	Let me go take a look around.
GID00020898	Damn it. Where'd he go?
GID00020899	I bet I know where you went.
GID00020900	Where'd you go?
GID00020901	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00020902	Ah, forget it. I'm gonna go get a drink.
GID00020903	I'm supposed to be retired.
GID00020904	No more fightin' for me.
GID00020905	That's enough.
GID00020906	Looks like they hightailed it.
GID00020907	Looks like I run them off.
GID00020908	Guess they threw up the sponge.
GID00020909	That wraps that up.
GID00020910	Coward.
GID00020911	Guess I'm done here.
GID00020912	You should've known better.
GID00020913	Well, that's that.
GID00020914	Hahaha!
GID00020915	Ah, well.
GID00020916	Excitement's over, I guess.
GID00020917	Kids these days...
GID00020918	Glad that's over with.
GID00020919	Guess you're not so tough.
GID00020920	Probably afraid of me.
GID00020921	Had enough? I thought so.
GID00020922	Yeah, I'd run away, too.
GID00020923	Fucked you up, bitch! And you know it!
GID00020924	Done and done.
GID00020925	Glad that's over.
GID00020926	Coward.
GID00020927	That's it, run away.
GID00020928	Degenerate.
GID00020929	What trickery is this? Only nightkin should vanish like that!
GID00020930	So fall the enemies of the Brotherhood.
GID00020931	Technology prevails.
GID00020932	Situation handled.
GID00020933	Hostile eliminated.
GID00020934	Tag 'em and bag 'em.
GID00020935	We're done here.
GID00020936	All clear.
GID00020937	I'm glad that's over with.
GID00020938	I guess that could have gone worse.
GID00020939	Guess we made it.
GID00020940	All right, it's over.
GID00020941	Whew.
GID00020942	I've had worse.
GID00020943	That's enough of that.
GID00020944	Wow, I'm actually still alive. Who would have guessed?
GID00020945	I'm sure our victory was purely thanks to your brilliant leadership, boss.
GID00020946	I guess old guys are tougher than we look, huh?
GID00020947	Glad that's over.
GID00020948	In no mood for hunting.
GID00020949	It's okay, sweetheart, the bad people are all gone now.
GID00020950	That will teach them to mess with my babies!
GID00020951	Leo won't be happy there's no one else to chop!
GID00020952	I didn't think you had it in you.
GID00020953	You can run, but you can't hide forever.
GID00020954	We'll save a shell for you.
GID00020955	Glad that's over with.
GID00020956	Good riddance.
GID00020957	Forget about it.
GID00020958	Haha! Gary!
GID00020959	Gary, Gary, Gary!
GID00020960	Awww, Gary.
GID00020961	Ah, forget it. I'm gonna go get a drink.
GID00020962	Not here...? Just saw, of course here  *shut up stupid head voice!*
GID00020963	Stupid head voice.
GID00020964	Done and done.
GID00020965	Hope you enjoyed your stay in Freeside.
GID00020966	And... we're done here.
GID00020967	The Kings reign supreme.
GID00020968	Is that it?
GID00020969	You're lucky I didn't find you.
GID00020970	That's right, run.
GID00020971	Fucking chicken.
GID00020972	Degenerate.
GID00020973	That's it, run away.
GID00020974	Coward.
GID00020975	Looks like I got my exercise for today.
GID00020976	And that's that.
GID00020977	That'll teach them to mess with mutants.
GID00020978	Ha ha. Too weak.
GID00020979	Done with you now.
GID00020980	Fight's over. Back to boring walking around.
GID00020981	Stupid weak things never last long.
GID00020982	Target lost. Engagement successful.
GID00020983	Target lost. No further action needed.
GID00020984	Target lost. Returning to non-combat operations.
GID00020985	Threat analysis: green. Neutralization operation complete.
GID00020986	Threat analysis: green. Security operation successful. Resuming normal operation.
GID00020987	Hostiles neutralized. Recommend immediate repairs to primary systems to ensure continued operation.
GID00020988	I'm glad that's over.
GID00020989	I'm sorry it had to end this way.
GID00020990	I'll always remember you. My memory circuits have almost unlimited capacity.
GID00020991	Situation... normal. Law and order has been restored.
GID00020992	Attention citizens. You may now resume your normal activities.
GID00020993	Law and order has prevailed.
GID00020994	A little peace and quiet, at last.
GID00020995	Well, that's it then.
GID00020996	That's enough excitement for one day.
GID00020997	That's how we do things in the U.S. army! Hoo-ah!
GID00020998	Time to hit the showers!
GID00020999	Another glorious day in the U.S. army!
GID00021000	Well, that's the end of that.
GID00021001	Teach you to mess with me.
GID00021002	That takes care of that.
GID00021003	Phew. I'm glad that's over.
GID00021004	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00021005	Just bugs I guess.
GID00021006	Get a grip, Doc.
GID00021007	Ears must be actin' up.
GID00021008	Seems my ears is playin' tricks on me.
GID00021009	Well I'm confounded. Must've been the wind.
GID00021010	Well I'm stumped. Guess it was nothin'.
GID00021011	Must've been nothing.
GID00021012	I've got better things to do.
GID00021013	Oh, well.
GID00021014	Need to stop jumping at shadows.
GID00021015	Huh... Oh, well.
GID00021016	Whatever it was, it's gone now.
GID00021017	Just a noise.
GID00021018	Just getting old, I guess.
GID00021019	Stupid deaf ear.
GID00021020	Must be hearing things again.
GID00021021	Scared me there for a second.
GID00021022	Guess there's nothing there.
GID00021023	God dammit... I guess it's nothin'.
GID00021024	Fine. I'll catch you next time.
GID00021025	Yeah that's right, I'd run away, too.
GID00021026	I must be going as crazy as ol' Rex.
GID00021027	Guess it was nothing.
GID00021028	I guess it was nothing.
GID00021029	Must've been nothing.
GID00021030	Nothing here.
GID00021031	I think they left, Rhonda.
GID00021032	All clear.
GID00021033	I've finished my sweep. Nothing to report.
GID00021034	Everyone back to your posts.
GID00021035	Something must be wrong with my suit's audio receptors.
GID00021036	Area secured.
GID00021037	Everything's quiet here. Heading back.
GID00021038	I've got nothing.
GID00021039	Never mind.
GID00021040	Huh. Maybe I need some glasses that aren't two hundred years old.
GID00021041	Nothing here, I guess.
GID00021042	Gone now.
GID00021043	Meh.
GID00021044	Ah, forget it.
GID00021045	I worry too much.
GID00021046	Sorry, boss. Must be my glaucomas acting up again.
GID00021047	If you say you saw something, I'm sure it was there.
GID00021048	Nothing here, boss.
GID00021049	Yeah, better run. Uh, them, not us.
GID00021050	Not worth our time.
GID00021051	Nothing. Must be nerves.
GID00021052	Let's move on.
GID00021053	Leo's playing tricks again.
GID00021054	It's okay, sweetheart, there aren't any monsters out there.
GID00021055	We're all alone now, pumpkin.
GID00021056	Nothing out here.
GID00021057	Guess I'm seeing things.
GID00021058	Aw, forget this.
GID00021059	Alright, just my imagination.
GID00021060	My mind is playing tricks on me. I gotta get laid.
GID00021061	Guess it was just in my head.
GID00021062	Ah, Gary.
GID00021063	Gaaary?`
GID00021064	Nothing!
GID00021065	Stupid head voice go away again.
GID00021066	Just stupid head voice again.
GID00021067	Guess I'm hearing things.
GID00021068	Probably just a rat.
GID00021069	Bah, it's nothing.
GID00021070	I got better things to do than jump at noises.
GID00021071	Whatever.
GID00021072	Someone must be fucking with me.
GID00021073	I was sure I heard something.
GID00021074	Goddamn, I must be tripping.
GID00021075	Must've been nothing.
GID00021076	Nothing here.
GID00021077	I guess it was nothing.
GID00021078	Must've been my imagination.
GID00021079	Whatever it was is gone now.
GID00021080	No sense wasting more time looking.
GID00021081	Just a noise. Gone now.
GID00021082	What was I doing again? Oh well.
GID00021083	Nothing there. Stupid noise fooled me.
GID00021084	Stupid ears. There's no noise out here.
GID00021085	Bah, searching is boring.
GID00021086	Suspending search.
GID00021087	Canceling search.
GID00021088	Halting search.
GID00021089	Threat analysis: green. Standing down.
GID00021090	Threat analysis: green. Resuming standard patrol pattern.
GID00021091	Threat analysis: green. Security sweep canceled.
GID00021092	Oh well. Maybe next time you'll introduce yourself.
GID00021093	Why did you run away? I'm really not as scary as I look.
GID00021094	You shouldn't tease me like that.
GID00021095	All clear.
GID00021096	Area secure.
GID00021097	False alarm. Standing down.
GID00021098	Back to the usual daily tedium.
GID00021099	Thought as much. Nothing there after all.
GID00021100	Beastly nuisance. Glad that's done with.
GID00021101	Another glorious day in the U.S. army.
GID00021102	False alarm. Stand down, people.
GID00021103	Nothing I like better than a little R&R on Uncle Sam's dime.
GID00021104	Whatever. I've got better things to do.
GID00021105	Hmm. Nothing here after all.
GID00021106	Ah, just getting jumpy I guess.
GID00021107	Guess it was nothing.
GID00021108	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00021109	I didn't want to do this!
GID00021110	You crossed the line.
GID00021111	You done ticked me off now.
GID00021112	Next stop: Boot Hill!
GID00021113	Yeeeeeehaw! Hahaha!

GID00021140	All mine.
GID00021141	What a shame.
GID00021142	Looks like break time's over.
GID00021143	Take 'em out.
GID00021144	Contact!
GID00021145	Hey!
GID00021146	Trouble.

GID00021149	Don't worry, boss, with my cataracts you only sort of look like the bad guys.
GID00021150	Yeah, yeah, time for more fighting, I know.
GID00021151	And then the fight started.

GID00021351	That doesn't sound good.
GID00021352	Hey. Something's there.
GID00021353	You hear that?
GID00021354	Huh?
GID00021355	Boss, if I heard something, you really should have heard something.
GID00021356	I think we got company.
GID00021357	Hello...?
GID00021358	That wasn't you, was it.
GID00021359	Hear something, doesn't sound like a friend of yours.
GID00021360	Looks like someone wants to be neighborly.

GID00021401	Intruder, identify yourself.
GID00021402	Unidentified intruder detected. Beginning search.
GID00021403	Approach and identify yourself. Law-abiding citizens will not be harmed.
GID00021404	Is that someone who needs me to kick their ass?
GID00021405	Move it out, people. I want this place searched top to bottom.
GID00021406	Who's ready to have their ass kicked?
GID00021407	I'm going to go check it out.
GID00021408	Did you hear something?
GID00021409	Huh?
GID00021410	What was that?
GID00021411	<Makes beeping sounds>

GID00021419	Just wait till I find you.
GID00021420	You won't escape that easily.
GID00021421	Come out you coward!
GID00021422	Hiding won't save you!
GID00021423	This isn't over!
GID00021424	Hm?
GID00021425	You just disappear?
GID00021426	You still there?
GID00021427	Don't think you can hide forever.
GID00021428	You're dead, you hear me?
GID00021429	Come out, come out wherever you are!
GID00021430	Ah shit, when I find you...
GID00021431	You think you'll get away from me?
GID00021432	Runnin' away like a little bitch!
GID00021433	What say you come out and we play some more?
GID00021434	I'll find you.
GID00021435	By Caesar, I will find you.
GID00021436	Skulking like a coward will not save you!
GID00021437	You won't escape me!
GID00021438	Come out now, and Tabitha will be merciful. Or at least an approximation thereof.
GID00021439	Still no sign of the hostile.
GID00021440	Continuing sweep.
GID00021441	The target can't have gone far.
GID00021442	Keep searching.
GID00021443	Anyone spot anything?
GID00021444	Where the hell did you go?
GID00021445	Nothing yet.
GID00021446	Gotta still be here...
GID00021447	Keep looking.
GID00021448	Still nothing...
GID00021449	Uh...
GID00021450	Not seeing anything...
GID00021451	Still looking, boss.
GID00021452	Amazingly, they've still managed to outwit a half-blind arthritic ghoul.
GID00021453	Don't worry boss, you'll know if I find anything.
GID00021454	Think they ran?
GID00021455	Less hide-and-seek, more shoot-and-kill.
GID00021456	I see jack and shit - 'cept no jack.
GID00021457	Not finding much.
GID00021458	You'd better come out befoe Leo gets mad!
GID00021459	Do you see anything, sweetie?
GID00021460	Don't worry, grandma's still looking!
GID00021461	Show yourself.
GID00021462	I can hear you breathing, Outsider.
GID00021463	I'll blow this place apart if I have to.
GID00021464	I'm gonna pop you when I find you again.
GID00021465	When I find you I'm gonna rip you a new one.
GID00021466	Come out, come out, whever you are.
GID00021467	Hunh? Gary?
GID00021468	Gary-wha?
GID00021469	Not seeing things! You're out there!
GID00021470	Stupid head voice wrong! I know you're there!
GID00021471	You come back!
GID00021472	C'mon. Less hiding, more fighting!
GID00021473	Come out, come out, wherever you are...
GID00021474	We *will* find you, you know.
GID00021475	You're only delaying the inevitable.
GID00021476	I'm starting to get bored.
GID00021477	What say you come out and take your asskicking like a man?
GID00021478	You can't hide from me.
GID00021479	Don't let me find you.
GID00021480	I know where you went.
GID00021481	You won't escape me!
GID00021482	Skulking like a coward will not save you!
GID00021483	By Caesar, I will find you.
GID00021484	Keep looking! They're here somewhere!
GID00021485	Be on your guard! The enemy could be anywhere!
GID00021486	You can't hide forever...
GID00021487	If I were a scared little thing, where would I hide?
GID00021488	Where are you?
GID00021489	Come out and fight!
GID00021490	Hiding boring! Fighting much more fun!
GID00021491	Before, just going to kill you. But now, going to kill you real bad!
GID00021492	Still searching.
GID00021493	Still analyzing.
GID00021494	Still attempting to reacquire target.
GID00021495	Alert. Non-combatant safety cannot be guaranteed.
GID00021496	Target lock status: red. Continuing perimeter sweep.
GID00021497	Alert. Hostile remains at large. Recommend non-combatants seek secure location.
GID00021498	There's no point in trying to hide from me, you know. I've been programmed to be quite relentless.
GID00021499	Please come back. I'm sorry about all that recent unpleasantness.
GID00021500	Where are you?
GID00021501	Are you still there?
GID00021502	Warning. Dangerous fugitive is on the loose. Do not attempt to apprehend.
GID00021503	Attention. Fugitive should be considered armed and dangerous.
GID00021504	Continuing search for fugitive.
GID00021505	You better run, you commie-loving bastard!
GID00021506	Who's got a target?
GID00021507	Come on, people, I need a target!
GID00021508	I've got something for you...
GID00021509	You can't hide from me forever.
GID00021510	I'm going to find you.
GID00021511	I'll find you.
GID00021512	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00021513	Where'd you go, punk?
GID00021514	I don't like this.
GID00021515	Somethin' don't feel right.
GID00021516	Hmm...
GID00021517	I do believe I heard somethin'.
GID00021518	Now what was that?
GID00021519	Hmm?
GID00021520	Come on out!
GID00021521	What was that?
GID00021522	Thought I heard something.
GID00021523	Something over there?
GID00021524	What was that?
GID00021525	Don't see anything, yet...
GID00021526	Hm?
GID00021527	What?
GID00021528	Strange...
GID00021529	Anyone there?
GID00021530	Hello?
GID00021531	What was that noise?
GID00021532	Huh?
GID00021533	Somethin' there?
GID00021534	What was that?
GID00021535	Don't make me come looking for you.
GID00021536	Who's there?
GID00021537	I thought I heard something...
GID00021538	You won't escape me.
GID00021539	Show yourself and I may let you live.
GID00021540	I know I heard something. Don't worry, Rhonda. We'll find them.
GID00021541	It's only a matter of time.
GID00021542	We will find you!
GID00021543	Come out and face your death!
GID00021544	Reveal yourself and I promise the end will come quick.
GID00021545	This grows tiresome.
GID00021546	This little sneak is beginning to vex me.
GID00021547	Hmm.
GID00021548	Keep looking.
GID00021549	What's going on?
GID00021550	Huh.
GID00021551	Stay sharp.
GID00021552	Got my eyes peeled.
GID00021553	Still looking.
GID00021554	Hmm.
GID00021555	Hmm.
GID00021556	I'm looking, I'm looking!
GID00021557	Hope you're looking, boss, because I don't see so good.
GID00021558	Anything moves, it's going to get it.
GID00021559	Don't see a thing.
GID00021560	Wish they'd show themselves.
GID00021561	I don't see them anywhere, Leo! Do you?
GID00021562	You can't hide from grandma!
GID00021563	If you don't come out soon, ooh, you're going to get such a paddling!
GID00021564	You're not getting away.
GID00021565	I know you're out there!
GID00021566	What was that?
GID00021567	Come out. I just want to talk.
GID00021568	Pretty sure I heard something.
GID00021569	Is there someone out there?
GID00021570	Gary, hmmm?
GID00021571	Gary, Gary?
GID00021572	Where'd you go, punk?
GID00021573	Huh?
GID00021574	What was that?
GID00021575	Wuh?
GID00021576	You better hope I don't find you.
GID00021577	Come out, if you dare.
GID00021578	Save us both some time and come on out.
GID00021579	Don't make me come looking for you.
GID00021580	Just stay right where you are. I'll find you.
GID00021581	When I find you I'm going to eat your spleen.
GID00021582	You're out here somewhere.
GID00021583	You won't escape me.
GID00021584	Show yourself and I may let you live.
GID00021585	I thought I heard something...
GID00021586	Hiding just delays the inevitable.
GID00021587	Keep looking, everyone.
GID00021588	I know you're here.
GID00021589	Why don't you come out?
GID00021590	Show yourself!
GID00021591	Analyzing.
GID00021592	Interpreting sense data.
GID00021593	Target unconfirmed.
GID00021594	Threat analysis: yellow. Scanning for hostiles.
GID00021595	Alert. Non-combatants are advised to leave the area. Security sweep in progress. Lethal force may be used without warning.
GID00021596	No hostiles detected. Continuing perimeter sweep.
GID00021597	Don't be alarmed if I try to kill you when I find you. It's just the way I've been programmed.
GID00021598	Why don't you just come out where I can see you?
GID00021599	I'll find you eventually, you know.
GID00021600	Where are you?
GID00021601	Scanning for hostiles.
GID00021602	This area clear. Proceeding with search protocol.
GID00021603	Please step into the open and identify yourself. Law-abiding citizens have nothing to fear.
GID00021604	It's just little old me. Nothing to be afraid of.
GID00021605	Someone dirty and disreputable, I shouldn't wonder.
GID00021606	Here kitty-kitty-kitty!
GID00021607	As if I'd know what to do if I found something.
GID00021608	Why not let the robot deal with it?
GID00021609	I'm going to look over here now.
GID00021610	Are you afraid of me? You should be because I'm going to kick your ass when I find you!
GID00021611	Step forward and identify yourself!
GID00021612	Do you think you can hide from me?
GID00021613	Do you think you can hide from me?
GID00021614	I'm starting to get angry. You would not like me when I'm angry.
GID00021615	Are you playing games with me, goddammit?
GID00021616	I cannot wait to find you so I can kill you as a personal favor to Uncle Sam.
GID00021617	Anybody there?
GID00021618	Maybe I'm just jumpy.
GID00021619	What was that?
GID00021620	Who's there?
GID00021621	You shouldn't be here.
GID00021622	You better go.
GID00021623	You got no right.
GID00021624	You'd best git or I'll be in a pucker.
GID00021625	Best be off right quick, pardner.
GID00021626	Why don't you mosey along, pardner.
GID00021627	Shoo!
GID00021628	I'm warning you.
GID00021629	Keep your distance.
GID00021630	Stop!
GID00021631	Don't.
GID00021632	Stay away!
GID00021633	Stay back.
GID00021634	Don't get any closer.
GID00021635	Not another step!
GID00021636	Get the fuck outta here.
GID00021637	Get out, now!
GID00021638	Hey! No trespassing.
GID00021639	Find someplace else to be.
GID00021640	You're not supposed to be here.
GID00021641	You don't belong here. Go.
GID00021642	You're treading on dangerous ground. I suggest you split.
GID00021643	You don't belong here.
GID00021644	Move along or suffer the consequences.
GID00021645	Leave while you still can.
GID00021646	Vacate the premises. Now.
GID00021647	This area is restricted.
GID00021648	This area belongs to the Brotherhood of Steel. Leave or face lethal force.
GID00021649	You need to leave.
GID00021650	You're not really supposed to be here.
GID00021651	Beat it.
GID00021652	Keep walking.
GID00021653	Uh uh. I don't think so.
GID00021654	Just keep on moving.
GID00021655	I got my eye on you. Even if it doesn't see so good.
GID00021656	You're outstaying your welcome.
GID00021657	Go away! Go away!
GID00021658	If you don't leave now, Leo might start chopping!
GID00021659	You're frightening the children! Leave!
GID00021660	Get lost.
GID00021661	You'll turn back, if you know what's good for you.
GID00021662	This area is off limits, Outsider.
GID00021663	Stay the fuck away from here.
GID00021664	This is restricted.
GID00021665	Hey, that's off limits.
GID00021666	Back off, human 
GID00021667	Go away!
GID00021668	Stop that, human 
GID00021669	This is the Kings' turf. Scram!
GID00021670	You should head back if you know what's good for you.
GID00021671	Back off!
GID00021672	You better think twice about that.
GID00021673	You don't belong here.
GID00021674	Get the fuck out of here.
GID00021675	Leave while you still can.
GID00021676	Move along or suffer the consequences.
GID00021677	You don't belong here.
GID00021678	You're not wanted here. Leave.
GID00021679	You're not supposed to be here. Go before I get angry.
GID00021680	This is our place. Go or be smashed.
GID00021681	Get out of here before I get mad!

GID00021683	This area is off-limits. Please vacate.
GID00021684	Leave the vicinity immediately. Thank you.

GID00021691	Warning. Leave the security zone immediately or you may be fired upon without further warning.
GID00021692	I don't mean to be rude, but you're not allowed here. You'd better leave before I'm forced to take preventive measures.
GID00021693	You're still within the restricted area. I really do advise you to leave immediately.
GID00021694	Perhaps you didn't hear me the first time. This is a restricted area. Please leave immediately.
GID00021695	I'm sorry, but you're not allowed here. I hope you won't turn this into an unpleasant situation.
GID00021696	I'm sorry. You've entered a restricted area. I may have to use deadly force if you don't leave immediately.
GID00021697	Excuse me, sir, but this is a restricted area. Please leave immediately so we can remain friends.

GID00021707	You're not allowed in here. Don't give me an excuse to use my weapon on you.
GID00021708	Do not push your luck any further.
GID00021709	I'll advise you again to leave immediately or I cannot be responsible for the consequences.
GID00021710	You're taking your life into your own hands.
GID00021711	You'd better get out of here if you know what's good for you.
GID00021712	Keep moving.
GID00021713	You'd better get out of here.
GID00021714	You're not supposed to be here, are you?
GID00021715	I didn't see anything.
GID00021716	Hate to see that.
GID00021717	Too bad.
GID00021718	Darn shame about that.
GID00021719	Huh...
GID00021720	Well, they's a goner.
GID00021721	Downright mean, that was.
GID00021722	Probably deserved it.
GID00021723	I've seen worse things happen to better people.
GID00021724	I'm not cleaning that up.
GID00021725	Yup.
GID00021726	Dead.
GID00021727	Too bad.
GID00021728	No one'll miss that one.
GID00021729	Howah...
GID00021730	Not my business.
GID00021731	Cha-ching!
GID00021732	Not my problem.
GID00021733	Just unlucky, I guess.
GID00021734	Must've had it comin'.
GID00021735	That settles that.
GID00021736	Yikes...
GID00021737	That just ain't right.
GID00021738	The weak must die.
GID00021739	One more to feed the worms.
GID00021740	A fair kill.
GID00021741	Good one!
GID00021742	You're a killer!
GID00021743	We all gotta go sometime.
GID00021744	Ugh.
GID00021745	Strange how dead bodies appear wherever you go.
GID00021746	Too bad.
GID00021747	Hmmph.
GID00021748	Easy come, easy go.
GID00021749	Yup. Definitely dead.
GID00021750	Well, that sure is a dead body there, boss.
GID00021751	I'm sure that was a cleverly-planned act, boss, and not just random psychosis.
GID00021752	That one won't be breathing any time soon. Ouch.
GID00021753	Well, that's all wrapped up.
GID00021754	Sure put a nail in that one.
GID00021755	That's all she wrote.
GID00021756	Sweetie, leave that messy business to Leo.
GID00021757	I'm sure that one was very naughty, pumpkin.
GID00021758	Leo says your technique was very good that time!
GID00021759	We kill to survive.
GID00021760	At least it was a quick death.
GID00021761	The tribe must be protected.
GID00021762	Nice clip there.
GID00021763	Someone just got burned.
GID00021764	Probably had it coming.
GID00021765	That's life in Freeside for you.
GID00021766	That had to hurt.
GID00021767	That hurt me just watching it.
GID00021768	They had it coming.
GID00021769	Bleed bitch. Bleed!
GID00021770	Like I give a fuck.
GID00021771	A fair kill.
GID00021772	One more to feed the worms.
GID00021773	The weak must die.
GID00021774	Bad way to go.
GID00021775	Nothing to do with me.
GID00021776	Ah ha ha ha ha!
GID00021777	Weakling!
GID00021778	Homicide detected.
GID00021779	Homicide is a serious offense.
GID00021780	Homicides will not be tolerated.
GID00021781	Ugh.
GID00021782	Hmmph.
GID00021783	Now that just wasn't called for.
GID00021784	Not my problem.
GID00021785	Sucks to be you.
GID00021786	I'm staying out of this one.
GID00021787	What are you thinking?
GID00021788	You ain't getting away with that.
GID00021789	What have you done?
GID00021790	What the samhill?
GID00021791	What in tarnation was you thinkin'?
GID00021792	You low-down scallywag!
GID00021793	Ahhhhhh...
GID00021794	What in the world?
GID00021795	Oh god!
GID00021796	Stop!
GID00021797	Don't!
GID00021798	God!
GID00021799	What in the hell are you doing?
GID00021800	What're you doing?
GID00021801	Help!
GID00021802	Murderer!
GID00021803	You won't get away with that.
GID00021804	Oh, what the hell?
GID00021805	Hey! Why would you do that?
GID00021806	Asshole!
GID00021807	That was way outta line.
GID00021808	I'm not gonna stand for that!
GID00021809	You killed him!
GID00021810	You killed her!
GID00021811	Reprisal!
GID00021812	Vengeance!
GID00021813	Retribution!
GID00021814	What have you done?
GID00021815	Murderer!
GID00021816	No!
GID00021817	You bastard!
GID00021818	You'll pay for that!
GID00021819	Filthy lowlife scum!
GID00021820	My god!
GID00021821	What in Maxson's name?
GID00021822	What the hell was that?
GID00021823	Are you mentally deranged?!
GID00021824	What the hell is wrong with you?!
GID00021825	Not a good idea.
GID00021826	You're gonna get us in some serious shit.
GID00021827	Hey! That's not okay.
GID00021828	What are you doing?
GID00021829	Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, boss, what the hell?
GID00021830	Boss, you really think that's a good idea?
GID00021831	Oh, good, the boss is murdering people now. Excellent.
GID00021832	Going to run out of friends at the rate you're going.
GID00021833	You are such an asshole sometimes.
GID00021834	Who's side are you on?
GID00021835	Did you do that on purpose?
GID00021836	You shouldn't be so naughty, pumpkin!
GID00021837	No, no, no! Leo does the chopping, not you, dearie!
GID00021838	That wasn't a nice thing to do!
GID00021839	You'll pay for that, Outsider!
GID00021840	Man down!
GID00021841	You son of a bitch.
GID00021842	That's some shit right there.
GID00021843	You're gonna pay for that.
GID00021844	Oh shit! Oh shit! Oh shit!
GID00021845	I'll have your blood, human!
GID00021846	Now you pay!
GID00021847	What the shit?
GID00021848	You got a deathwish?
GID00021849	Dammit that is going to stink.
GID00021850	Shit.
GID00021851	Oh damn, that's going to leave a stain.
GID00021852	Retribution!
GID00021853	Vengeance!
GID00021854	Reprisal!
GID00021855	You think you'll just get away with that?
GID00021856	You'll pay for that, scum!
GID00021857	You'll die for that!
GID00021858	Uh-oh.
GID00021859	Heavily engaged.
GID00021860	Threat level elevated.
GID00021861	Crime detected. Judicial circuits recommend immediate application of capital punishment.
GID00021862	Crime detected. Application of death sentence commencing.
GID00021863	Crime detected. Consulting judicial circuits... offender sentenced to death.
GID00021864	Even I know that was not a nice thing to do.

GID00021921	That didn't even tickle.
GID00021922	Enough.
GID00021923	You're asking for it.
GID00021924	What the hell are you doing?

GID00022002	All right, but don't let it happen again!
GID00022003	That's better.
GID00022004	All right - since you gave in.

GID00022019	Okay. Well, I guess I can let it go this time.
GID00022020	Next time, I'll put a nail in your head.
GID00022021	Done fucking around? Good.
GID00022022	Temporary insanity? All right.
GID00022023	Did someone slip Psycho into your water or are you just naturally berserk?
GID00022024	You shouldn't be so mean to people!
GID00022025	Behave yourself from now on, you hear?

GID00022045	Better not try that again.
GID00022046	Please, have mercy!
GID00022047	Hey! That don't belong to you, so keep your grubby mitts off it!
GID00022048	You should give that back.

GID00022087	Hey! I need that for stuff!
GID00022088	Come on. At least steal from a mean person.
GID00022089	<Sigh>Boss, if you just ask, I'll hand it to you. Probably.
GID00022090	Boss, why do my pants suddenly feel lighter?
GID00022091	Look, boss, I appreciate you not making me carry that, but come on.
GID00022092	Think I didn't see that?
GID00022093	Good way to lose a hand.
GID00022094	Sweetie, if you want something, just ask grandma politely.
GID00022095	Stealing isn't very nice, is it Leo?
GID00022096	Is someone looking for a paddling?
GID00022097	Open fire!
GID00022098	Stop the Outsider!

GID00022135	I thought I had seen every species of moronic petty bullshit, but you've just topped the list. Congratulations.
GID00022136	Do you have no respect for private property, you slimy little commie bastard?
GID00022137	Did you not realize that I have eyes in the back of my head?
GID00022138	That isn't yours!

GID00022767	I'm a much better tactician than you. It's all in the brain, you see.
GID00022768	Please don't take this the wrong way.
GID00022769	Which do you like better -- the psionic beam or the laser?
GID00022770	Nothing personal.
GID00022771	You could run? I am trying to kill you, after all.
GID00022772	I hope this unpleasantness will be over soon.
GID00022773	Hold still please. It's harder to hit you if you keep running around like that.
GID00022774	I hope we can still be friends when this is all over.
GID00022775	Please believe me when I say I'm not enjoying this.
GID00022776	I wish there was some other way we could have worked this out.
GID00022777	I'm afraid I'm a very lethal killing machine.
GID00022778	Running away is probably your only hope.
GID00022779	My programming requires that I keep trying to kill you.
GID00022780	Don't feel bad if you don't defeat me. I am one of the most advanced military robots available.
GID00022781	I'm not programmed to fail. Just so you know.
GID00022782	They could have programmed me to love. To forgive. But nnoooo...
GID00022783	I don't mean to be insensitive, but you really can't win.

GID00022810	Eat hot lead, you commie bastard!
GID00022811	Ready to die for your country?
GID00022812	Pain is just weakness leaving the body!
GID00022813	Today's a hell of day to die, commie!
GID00022814	Come on, people, give 'em hell!
GID00022815	How do you like that, you mother-loving commie!
GID00022816	Made in the U.S.A.!
GID00022817	No surrender!
GID00022818	Is that the best you can do?
GID00022819	I'm just getting warmed up! Hoo-ah!
GID00022820	There's nothing I like better than the smell of plasma in the morning!
GID00022821	What's the matter, you pansy ass pinko? Getting tired?
GID00022822	We are lean! We are mean!
GID00022823	I have a personal message for you from Uncle Sam!
GID00022824	Running will only make the pain last longer!
GID00022825	Kill them all! God will understand.
GID00022826	There's nothing I like better than making some other poor bastard die for his country.
GID00022827	Now you're starting to piss me off.
GID00022828	Do stand still!
GID00022829	And who gets to clean up all this blood? Me, that's who...
GID00022830	Oohh. Yesss... Let's all beat up on the robot...
GID00022831	By God, if I had hands I would strangle the life out of you!
GID00022832	Have at thee!
GID00022833	For Queen and country!
GID00022834	You have insulted my honor, and for that, you must die!
GID00022835	Kill!
GID00022836	Die!
GID00022837	Never!
GID00022838	Pain!
GID00022839	Again!
GID00022840	Stop you!
GID00022841	Yeeargh!
GID00022842	Raaagghh!
GID00022843	Raaarr!
GID00022844	Agghh!
GID00022845	Arrggh!
GID00022846	Had enough?
GID00022847	Come on!
GID00022848	You like that?
GID00022849	<hacking cough>
GID00022850	So... thirsty...
GID00022851	Won't someone please... water...
GID00022852	I can't take it anymore... please... help me...
GID00022853	Please... God... so thirsty...
GID00022854	Chair... empty? Head voices say so.
GID00022855	Head voices say silver chair flies east.
GID00022856	Chip slippery! More slippery than the Chair thinks!
GID00022857	Buildings not covered in blood. Chip is cause?
GID00022858	Chip goes when broken man calls!
GID00022859	Shiny screens brighter! Don't let them flicker at us!
GID00022860	Withered... broken! Not speak any more.
GID00022861	Broken one is ended. Head voice not sure what this mean.
GID00022862	When Mars calls... we run?
GID00022863	Thorn... *pulled* from flesh of bull? Not sure why.
GID00022864	Bull is broken. But bull has many friends.
GID00022865	Bull lies dead. Dogs coming for fresh meat.
GID00022866	Bull not as smart as he thinks! Can't see dogs around him.
GID00022867	Shiny screens brighter! Why so bright?
GID00022868	Shiny screens go dark. Stupid head voice have no use for shiny screens.
GID00022869	Snake dead! Rats scurry while they can.
GID00022870	Bears returning! Rats will flee.
GID00022871	Arms of mars are unbound. Watch them swing!
GID00022872	Head voice say bear heads still talking. Is surprised at this.
GID00022873	Bear heads in pain. Chip cannot help them.
GID00022874	Chip hurt bear heads! Stupid head voices afraid.
GID00022875	Bear heads in pain. But voices don't know who hurt them.
GID00022876	Green grass man dead. Head voices wonder why?
GID00022877	Green grass man dead. We understand why.
GID00022878	One head cut off. Head voices say many will take its place.
GID00022879	Hah hah, many rats dead in gutters today!
GID00022880	Bull attacks bears! Many more will come.
GID00022881	Horns will help the bull. Voices say they knew that would happen.
GID00022882	Bear has horns? Head voices not see that coming.
GID00022883	Horns fall on bloody rocks. Head voices saw many bodies.
GID00022884	Horns leave this place. Head voices see them go far away.
GID00022885	Horns unleashed. Many will feel their sting.
GID00022886	Crowned heads lie dead. Bear heads growing strong.
GID00022887	Crowned heads make nice with bears? Voices confused.
GID00022888	Metal men walk no more. Stupid metal men. Head voices don't like metal men!
GID00022889	Head voices say Mars angry.
GID00022890	Bears hurt.
GID00022891	Squishy human not making many friends.
GID00022892	Bears grow stronger. But still sit on edge of cliff.
GID00022893	Bears in pain. Head voices not surprised.
GID00022894	Bears killed cornered dogs. Voices not surprised.
GID00022895	Horns dead on rock city.
GID00022896	Horns on the run. Voices wonder where they going?
GID00022897	Head voices say new meat will rot in the sun.
GID00022898	Bears taking over twisty track. Voices unsure of this.
GID00022899	Head voices wonder... why bull doggies die?
GID00022900	Head voices hear of new metal men. But not metal men. Different metal men. Make head hurt.
GID00022901	Bears strong like metal men? Bears stronger now.
GID00022902	Mars growing bigger. Shadow gets larger.
GID00022903	Mars *eclipsing* bears. Bulls come soon.
GID00022904	Head voices hear things. Many things. Not all make sense.
GID00022905	Head voices see clouds in the sky. Where is sun?
GID00022906	Sun sets.
GID00022907	Voices say waters close around bears *and* bull. Not sure who in better shape.
GID00022908	Head voices say smart man also metal man. Don't like metal men!
GID00022909	Head voices say quiet man knows more than he says about horns!
GID00022910	Head voices say they knew flower girl's father.
GID00022911	Funny robot make blinky sounds.
GID00022912	Head voices say someone close. Someone like us.
GID00022913	Head voices know smelly ghoul. He old and good with guns.
GID00022914	Head voices speak of doggy with squishy brain.
GID00022915	Book girl has hard decision to make.
GID00022916	Huh?
GID00022917	Not always. I have other places I need to be, but I stop by every few days or so.
GID00022918	I'm usually here a few days out of the week. Mostly to keep the fridge stocked. Plus it's nice to get away from it all every now and then.
GID00022919	No, there are other places that require my attention.
GID00022920	My duties tend to take me elsewhere, but I try to be here at least a few days out of the week.
GID00022921	Thank you, every tag you bring me is one more soldier at peace.
GID00022922	I was stationed at Camp Searchlight before the incident.
GID00022923	I've since taken it upon myself to keep travelers away from the area.
GID00022924	All right. I'll be here, obviously.
GID00022925	Fine. Just get me those Sugar Bombs.
GID00022926	Come back when you've found the igniting agent.
GID00022927	Come back when you've tracked down the thrust control modules.
GID00022928	Great, let's do everything when it's convenient for you.
GID00022929	You can jump out the window, for all I care, mister.
GID00022930	You got no right to come in here and start criticizing our town. Folks work hard to keep it clean and safe.
GID00022931	We do the best we can. But still there's always some of you finicky types that there's just no pleasing.
GID00022932	You can jump out the window, for all I care, lady.
GID00022933	You got no right to come in here and start criticizing our town. Folks work hard to keep it clean and safe.
GID00022934	We do the best we can. But still there's always some of you finicky types that there's just no pleasing.
GID00022935	Okay, if that's what you think.
GID00022936	Again? All right.
GID00022937	As long as we don't go too far. Jeannie May would have a fit if she saw me out and about.
GID00022938	Any excuse to get out of my room.
GID00022939	What, now? This better be good.
GID00022940	You say so, chief.
GID00022941	If you're talking about that thing that looks like the entrance to the center of the Earth, I think it might just be a pothole.
GID00022942	But we better check it out anyway.
GID00022943	I know we already did this, but this time things might turn out different.
GID00022944	I guess I can leave the store for a minute. I hope I don't miss any customers.
GID00022945	Really? Store's still okay, isn't it?
GID00022946	You sure seem worked up about something. I suppose I can hear you out.
GID00022947	It's kinda late, but I guess if it's important to you.
GID00022948	Sure thing.
GID00022949	I can give you stims or radiation supplies, which would you prefer?
GID00022950	I have some goods collected during my travels. You may take something if you wish.
GID00022951	Certainly, which type of ammo would you like?
GID00022952	Later.
GID00022953	Bye.
GID00022954	Vale.
GID00022955	Later.
GID00022956	Humanity lost many things after the war. Methods of agriculture, techniques for survival.
GID00022957	We took it upon ourselves to piece together this knowledge and bring it back to them.
GID00022958	We're scattered, mostly. We go where we're needed. Our largest presence is in Freeside at Old Mormon Fort.
GID00022959	Other than that, I know Dr. Usanagi set up a practice near the Crimson Caravan. And a man we trained is operating out of the Aerotech building.
GID00022960	Another man, Tom Anderson, was looking into water supply problems in Westside. But that was a while ago.
GID00022961	We did, for a time. But our goals differ. The NCR only cares to expand their wealth and their reach.
GID00022962	For us, territorial boundaries mean nothing. And prosperity has to be for everyone, not just citizens of the NCR.
GID00022963	So a parting was inevitable. While the NCR pushes east, we clean up the mess they leave behind. Try to provide some stability.
GID00022964	If you insist on going north, don't be expecting a rescue when you get into trouble.
GID00022965	Yep.
GID00022966	If you want to be that way I'll leave you alone.
GID00022967	From what I've been able to gather, they've been seen messing around with the machinery up there. What could they be up to?
GID00022968	I don't know what else I could tell you. You could give No-bark a try, though, or Jeannie May.
GID00022969	Bye!
GID00022970	All right, I'll just get my scalpel here, and... ugh. Did I leave that sitting outside? Well, you know what? Free tetanus shot!
GID00022971	Okay. Hold still.
GID00022972	Darn it! That money was going to help pay to get me some medical training.
GID00022973	Well, come back when you do. I'll be here.
GID00022974	Okay, that's about the best I can do. Try not to get hurt that bad again, it's not like I've got an endless supply of bandages.
GID00022975	Then I'm sorry, but I don't have any treatment for you. My priority is helping the refugees here at this camp.
GID00022976	All right, just hold steady. Want a shot of whiskey to calm your nerves? Mind if I have one? Heh heh, little doctor humor there.
GID00022977	Then I can't help you much. Now, maybe if you enlisted....
GID00022978	This shouldn't take too long. Just close your eyes and try to relax.
GID00022979	I'm afraid protocol prevents me from treating you then.
GID00022980	This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
GID00022981	This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
GID00022982	For crying out loud. Get out of my face then.
GID00022983	Sometimes ignoring something is the best medicine.
GID00022984	Suit yourself.
GID00022985	Swing back by if you change your mind. I'll see what I can do for you.
GID00022986	You want to play tough guy, that's no skin off my nose.
GID00022987	You want to play tough gal, that's no skin off my nose.
GID00022988	Not my clinical opinion, but so be it.
GID00022989	Suit yourself.
GID00022990	Fine by me.
GID00022991	Sure. Just don't treat me like a pack Brahmin, okay?
GID00022992	Ooo. Got something good for me? Is it a dress?
GID00022993	You're making me carry the heavy stuff, aren't you?
GID00022994	I'm sure you'll be fair and equitable, boss.
GID00022995	I expect to be awed by your dizzying mercantile sense, boss.
GID00022996	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00022997	<bark!>
GID00022998	Let's distribute the weight.
GID00022999	Let's deal.
GID00023000	Let's see what you got.
GID00023001	Grandma's got a present for you!
GID00023002	Come back when you have news about the Boomers.
GID00023003	Come back when you know more about the White Glove Society.
GID00023004	Return to me when you've destroyed the Brotherhood of Steel.
GID00023005	Come back when you've destroyed whatever you find down in that bunker.
GID00023006	Complete your mission, then return to me.
GID00023007	Vale.
GID00023008	<Laughs>Yeah. I'm with you there.
GID00023009	Like what?
GID00023010	I think I may have misheard that order.
GID00023011	If that's what you think.
GID00023012	Good call! I mean, if that's what you really want, boss.
GID00023013	Why does everyone always say that?
GID00023014	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00023015	I thought my charm could win you over, but I guess it wasn't meant to be. Are you sure you want me to go?
GID00023016	<whimper>
GID00023017	If you're sure... your loss.
GID00023018	What no music? I'll hold the tears 'til I'm gone.
GID00023019	If you're sure... your loss. Can't say I couldn't use a break from you for a while.
GID00023020	Aww, grandma will miss her little pumpkin! Are you sure?
GID00023021	There are plenty of people here to talk to you about us and our mission. Let's get to brass tacks and talk about that robot.
GID00023022	Gangers, gangsters, all sounds like trouble to me.
GID00023023	All right, let's play.
GID00023024	A fellow enthusiast, huh? That's great! Let's play.
GID00023025	Sure. Old No-bark is always looking to play. Not for entertainment, mind you, but because if you look at the cards right you can know the future.
GID00023026	Damn straight I would! Let's see what you got.
GID00023027	Bring it on, buddy!
GID00023028	I always have time for a good game of Caravan. I hope you're up to the challenge.
GID00023029	A fascinating proposition. Naturally, my considerable genius makes me a master of the game, so try not to be disappointed if you lose miserably.
GID00023030	You betcha! Caravan's got me through many a long night before. I hope you're ready.
GID00023031	You think you have what it takes, kid?
GID00023032	All right, let's see what you got.
GID00023033	I'm going to roll over you.
GID00023034	That was too easy. How about we play again and this time you actually try.
GID00023035	No-bark wins! A few more like that and the curse'll get lifted for sure.
GID00023036	Don't take it to heart. I've studied the strategies of the masters.
GID00023037	Nice try. Care to try your luck again?
GID00023038	It looks like you need a bit more practice. Another lesson perhaps?
GID00023039	I am unsurprised regarding your appalling lack of talent. Perhaps you'd care to try another hand? After all, you can only improve.
GID00023040	Here I was thinking you'd be a challenge, want a rematch?
GID00023041	Nice try. Let's play another game.
GID00023042	Dammit. I should have won that match. Let's play again.
GID00023043	Dang it! Shoulda known you was getting caravan hints from the bloatfly spirits what live in these parts.
GID00023044	Well I'll be cold and rotting before I let them get the best of me. Let's go again.
GID00023045	Huh. I wonder where I went wrong. Let's try that again.
GID00023046	Not too bad. How about we play again?
GID00023047	Impressive. That was a very good game. Would you care to play again?
GID00023048	Well now, this is an unexpected variable. You really must let me challenge you to a rematch, so I can analyze what passes for your strategy.
GID00023049	Dammit, I thought I had you there. Let's play again.
GID00023050	Wow, you're good. Give me another game.
GID00023051	I'll be here if you ever want a rematch.
GID00023052	Dang it, No-bark, just when you was making a friend.
GID00023053	Shucks, well, let's do it again sometime.
GID00023054	Okay. If you want to play again sometime, let me know.
GID00023055	Another time then, perhaps.
GID00023056	As you wish. Once you've salved your battered ego, perhaps you'll make another go of it.
GID00023057	You know where to find me if you want to play again.
GID00023058	What? Afraid to lose. Well come find me if you want to play again.
GID00023059	I hope you're ready for this.
GID00023060	No more magic spells this time.
GID00023061	I've got a good feeling about this hand.
GID00023062	Let's get this started!
GID00023063	Excellent. Let the game begin!
GID00023064	Very well. I would wish you luck, but of course peerless intellect is all that matters here.
GID00023065	Ok, hope you're ready to lose.
GID00023066	Let the Caravan Lesson begin.
GID00023067	Oh... All right. So, Ah... Bye.
GID00023068	Never forget the Bitter Springs Massacre.
GID00023069	Have a good time, baby.
GID00023070	Suit yourself. Gambling's thirsty work - I'll be here if you change your mind.
GID00023071	Good luck.
GID00023072	Try not to do anything too disruptive, okay?
GID00023073	Good riddance.
GID00023074	Yeah, goodbye.
GID00023075	Stay safe out there.
GID00023076	Yeah, okay, see you around.
GID00023077	Get lost.
GID00023078	So long.
GID00023079	Goodbye, Rocketeer, be sure to visit again! Oh, and please - for your own safety, stay outside of restricted areas.
GID00023080	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00023081	Please... help me.
GID00023082	Please... God... I just need water.
GID00023083	Adios.
GID00023084	Ta-ta.
GID00023085	Ciao.
GID00023086	Come back when you have news about the Boomers.
GID00023087	Come back when you know more about the White Glove Society.

GID00023089	Come back when you've destroyed whatever you find down in that bunker.
GID00023090	Complete your mission, then return to me.
GID00023091	Vale.
GID00023092	Make yourself scarce. If you get yourself in trouble, I'm not going to cover your back.

GID00023111	Hey, uh. Wait a sec. I know what I said, but... if you find yourself by Ranger Station Charlie, let me know what you find. I'd be interested.
GID00023112	Look out for yourself.
GID00023113	Watch out for strangers.
GID00023114	Yeah, see you.
GID00023115	So long.
GID00023116	Nice of you to visit.

GID00023140	Don't stay away too long!
GID00023141	See you around!
GID00023142	Goodbye.
GID00023143	Remain vigilant.
GID00023144	The power of the law rests in the hands of every citizen.

GID00023162	Anything that gets us out of here, please.
GID00023163	No, please! Don't leave me here!
GID00023164	So long.

GID00023202	Be careful out there.
GID00023203	Yeah.
GID00023204	Take it easy now.
GID00023205	You take care, now.
GID00023206	Keep your gun handy if you go poking around some of the abandoned places around here, like the schoolhouse. Critters move in there sometimes.
GID00023207	Yup.
GID00023208	Yeah.
GID00023209	I'll be waiting.
GID00023210	Until next time.
GID00023211	So long.

GID00023215	Be careful out there.
GID00023216	All right. Goodbye.
GID00023217	Hey, yeah. Next time you see me, maybe I'll be rolling in a shitload of caps, right?
GID00023218	Yeah... I always scare off the hot ones...
GID00023219	Yeah. Try not to get killed.
GID00023220	Yeah, I'll s-s-see you around.
GID00023221	Right.
GID00023222	Carry on.
GID00023223	Always a pleasure. You keep yourself safe.
GID00023224	You know where to find me, honey.
GID00023225	Good luck.

GID00023232	Fuck off.
GID00023233	Yes, yes.
GID00023234	Be seeing you. Maybe.
GID00023235	Uh-huh.
GID00023236	Hmmph.

GID00023238	Sure, boss.

GID00023240	Yeah, whatever.
GID00023241	Toodle-oo!
GID00023242	I somehow suspect you'll be back to converse with me later.
GID00023243	Right.
GID00023244	Goodbye.
GID00023245	Do come find us!
GID00023246	Return to me, wanderer. We need your help.
GID00023247	Let me know when the underground has been rid of the demons.
GID00023248	There is no way that we can thank you enough, wanderer. Your arrival here was a blessing. We will remember you always.
GID00023249	Goodbye, wanderer.
GID00023250	Choke on your goodbyes.
GID00023251	I'll be here.
GID00023252	Best of luck to you.
GID00023253	Ta-ta.
GID00023254	Let's plan on meeting again as soon as- Wait. Did you hear something? Were you followed?
GID00023255	Farewell.
GID00023256	About time.
GID00023257	Indeed.
GID00023258	Uh huh.
GID00023259	Adieu.
GID00023260	Farewell.
GID00023261	Pleasure speaking to you.

GID00023266	Come back if you need something.
GID00023267	Yeah.
GID00023268	Here, you'll want this. It's the password to one of the terminals outside. Found it written on one of the stalls in the bathroom.
GID00023269	Adios, amigo.
GID00023270	Later.
GID00023271	Goodbye.
GID00023272	Catch you later.
GID00023273	Bye.
GID00023274	Later.
GID00023275	Yep. See you round.
GID00023276	Take care, pardner. And keep drinking Sunset Sarsaparilla!
GID00023277	No problem. If you do end up trying to collect more stars, watch out for a man named Allen Marks. He's killed several people for their stars already.
GID00023278	All right, then.
GID00023279	Okay, then.
GID00023280	See you later.
GID00023281	Goobye!
GID00023282	Until next time.

GID00023310	You have yourself a fine day, madame.
GID00023311	If there's anything you require further feel free to ask, sir.
GID00023312	If there's anything you require further feel free to ask, madame.
GID00023313	I'll be sure and tidy up while you're away, sir.
GID00023314	I'll be sure and tidy up while you're away, madame.
GID00023315	By Caesar's will.
GID00023316	True to Caesar.
GID00023317	Vale.
GID00023318	Sir.
GID00023319	Ma'am.
GID00023320	Dismissed.
GID00023321	See you.
GID00023322	Yeah, bye.
GID00023323	Goodbye.
GID00023324	Of course, of course! Don't let me keep you!
GID00023325	See you around, mister.
GID00023326	Okay, miss. See you around.
GID00023327	Okay, bye.
GID00023328	Yeah, me too.
GID00023329	Bye-bye.
GID00023330	See you later, alligator.

GID00023335	Bye.
GID00023336	Bye.
GID00023338	Get fucked.
GID00023339	Piss off.
GID00023340	Yeah, whatever.
GID00023341	Come on back if you get lonely, sweet thing.
GID00023342	Please... I'm dying. I need water...
GID00023343	Please. Water... help me...
GID00023344	Please help me. Please?
GID00023345	Have a seat, baby - let's get this kicking.
GID00023346	Sit down, hey? Don't keep me waiting.
GID00023347	Baby, you can savor the swank digs all you want when we're done talking. Sit down.
GID00023348	Don't just stand there looking stupid.
GID00023349	Got something to say?
GID00023350	Don't just stare in dumb admiration.
GID00023351	Mind where you point those dimmers.
GID00023352	Hey.
GID00023353	Thanks for talking us out of our evil ways. I'm starting on that novel soon. Pauline is so happy. You are a nice person! Hurray!
GID00023354	Sammy and I are grateful. We are going to follow our dreams.
GID00023355	What the hell do you want?
GID00023356	What the hell are you doing here?
GID00023357	You again?
GID00023358	Hey doc.
GID00023359	Hey doc.
GID00023360	You're slowing down. Pick it up!
GID00023361	Good. You'll be a Legionary yet.
GID00023362	What the fuck was that? I've seen crippled slaves move faster.
GID00023363	Run faster or I will throw you off the side.
GID00023364	Welcome. Come on in!
GID00023365	Hey, you came back! Must be doing something right.
GID00023366	How ya doing?
GID00023367	Look who's here.
GID00023368	Hey there.
GID00023369	Hey. Welcome.
GID00023370	Howdy.
GID00023371	Ma'am.
GID00023372	Hey.
GID00023373	Careful. They got spies all over.
GID00023374	Hello, potential customer.
GID00023375	Hello, it is great to finally meet you.
GID00023376	What the hell is your problem?
GID00023377	Howdy, pardner!
GID00023378	Lovely weather, eh?
GID00023379	Looking for anything in particular?
GID00023380	How's it going?
GID00023381	We've got stuff you never realized you needed.
GID00023382	Feel free to look around.
GID00023383	Hey ya.
GID00023384	Just let me know if anything catches your eye.
GID00023385	We've got competitive prices and a good inventory.
GID00023386	<Unintelligible Grunt/Burp>
GID00023387	Thank you for visiting New Vegas.
GID00023388	Move along.
GID00023389	Place your bets and give the wheel a spin!
GID00023390	Give her a spin and win big!
GID00023391	Have a seat and give lady luck a chance!
GID00023392	Try your hand at blackjack!
GID00023393	The bosses are having a meeting. You'll have to wait until it's over.
GID00023394	Be patient. The guns'll still be here in a few minutes.
GID00023395	Keep moving.
GID00023396	You got a problem?
GID00023397	We're watching you. Closely.
GID00023398	Keep your hands where we can see them.
GID00023399	Stay away!
GID00023400	Kill me!
GID00023401	Don't get too close to Mr. Benny
GID00023402	No sudden moves around the boss, got it?
GID00023403	I got my eye on you, so no funny business.
GID00023404	Keep those hands where I can see 'em.
GID00023405	Ring-a-ding, baby.
GID00023406	How's it hangin'?
GID00023407	I am so happy to see you!
GID00023408	Yay, it's you!
GID00023409	I am so glad to see you!
GID00023410	Heya mama, what's the haps?
GID00023411	Hope Swank's smarter than Benny.
GID00023412	Wonder where Benny got off to?
GID00023413	I thought Benny was a stand up guy - hard to believe he was a rat all along.
GID00023414	You dig this crazy scene or what?
GID00023415	<growl>
GID00023416	Ave.
GID00023417	Ave.
GID00023418	Ave.
GID00023419	Ave.
GID00023420	Aw crap.
GID00023421	Hi.
GID00023422	Heh.
GID00023423	Hello.
GID00023424	<Whistling>
GID00023425	<Humming>
GID00023426	Howdy.
GID00023427	How about some grub?
GID00023428	Whew, you don't look so good. You might want to see Doc Kemp.
GID00023429	If you need anything, just give me a holler.
GID00023430	Now is not a good time.
GID00023431	I'm a busy man.
GID00023432	You look like you could use some medical attention.
GID00023433	Damn addicts.
GID00023434	You look like you're suffering from some radiation sickness.
GID00023435	Howdy.
GID00023436	Hello.
GID00023437	Can I help you?
GID00023438	Hey, over here.
GID00023439	Damn leg.
GID00023440	Oh, excuse me.
GID00023441	Afternoon, friend.
GID00023442	Good day, sir.
GID00023443	Good day, sir.
GID00023444	Excuse me, coming through!
GID00023445	Get out of the way, chump!
GID00023446	Move, lard ass!
GID00023447	Scoot your boots, ya bum!
GID00023448	Eesh, boss, are you trying to destroy my knees even faster than nature?
GID00023449	Oh, wearing this is not going to be good to me.
GID00023450	How'd you know I had a sweet tooth, boss?
GID00023451	Ahh, sarsaparilla. That's just what this dry old throat needs.
GID00023452	You're going to rot my teeth, boss. What's left of them, anyways.
GID00023453	Hey there, "Cannibal." Heard you become a hunter - good for you.
GID00023454	Looks like you're going to get another to chance to fly, Whitman. Hope you haven't lost your touch.
GID00023455	You look like shit, Johnson. Damn, you got old.
GID00023456	Together again, eh, Captain?
GID00023457	It's nice to see us all here - even you, Moreno.
GID00023458	Do little angels want butterscotch candies? Sweets for sweeties!
GID00023459	Aww, aren't you just precious? Come here little darling, let grandma pinch your cheek!
GID00023460	Look at this little dear! Grandma Lily could just eat you up!
GID00023461	Peek-a-boo! I see you!
GID00023462	Come here little one, give Grandma Lily some sugar!
GID00023463	Have you got a hug for me, cutie-pie?
GID00023464	Grandma Lily's got hugs and kisses for all good little children! Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!
GID00023465	Who wants some of Grandma Lily's famous Chocolate Double Surprise?
GID00023466	Outrageous what Mortimer did. The nerve of some people.
GID00023467	Oh, Mortimer. You always had the gift of gaffe.
GID00023468	Usually we punish people who come in here uninvited. But you've made such a splash, we don't have the heart.
GID00023469	Your theatrics were just priceless. I salute you.
GID00023470	The boy has seen too much!
GID00023471	Trespasser!
GID00023472	You don't belong here!
GID00023473	Leave this instant!
GID00023474	Outsiders are forbidden!
GID00023475	What the devil?
GID00023476	Good day.
GID00023477	How do you do?
GID00023478	Greetings.
GID00023479	Salutations.
GID00023480	How do you fare?
GID00023481	Hello, there.
GID00023482	<growl>
GID00023483	<bark!>
GID00023484	You sure you're in the right place?
GID00023485	Well, well, well. Look what walked in.
GID00023486	Nobody around here's hiring if you're looking for work.
GID00023487	Hey.
GID00023488	This chainlink fence perimeter is worthless. We might as well be defending a cage from the inside.
GID00023489	This place is off-limits to civilians. You don't like it, take it up with Lieutenant Haggerty.
GID00023490	Pretty sure H.Q. has forgotten all about us.
GID00023491	Who knows which side the Legion's gonna hit us from next?
GID00023492	If the Legion breaks through our defenses, I got one bullet I'm saving just for me.
GID00023493	We should be up on the front lines, not out here in bumblefuck. This place is a junkyard.
GID00023494	We're supposed to be relieved any day. That's what they keep telling us. I don't think anyone's coming.
GID00023495	Maybe that guy Fantastic wasn't an idiot. Maybe he was a genius.
GID00023496	Damn that was some light show out there.
GID00023497	That was blinding out there. Feels like I've been staring at the sun.
GID00023498	Is the plant actually working again?
GID00023499	The attacks have stopped. Winning the dam saved our asses.
GID00023500	We lost Forlorn Hope. The eastern front is collapsing. They'll be here next.
GID00023501	Heard the Brotherhood got smoked. Guess somebody finished what we started.
GID00023502	With Caesar dead, maybe they'll stop attacking us.
GID00023503	Hey, man.
GID00023504	Hello.
GID00023505	What is it? I'm a busy woman.
GID00023506	Paladin.
GID00023507	Hello, outsider.
GID00023508	You're being watched, so don't get any ideas.
GID00023509	The bunker takes a little getting used to, doesn't it?
GID00023510	How may I assist you?
GID00023511	Paladin.
GID00023512	Initiate.
GID00023513	Greetings, Elder.
GID00023514	Knight.
GID00023515	Hello, sir.
GID00023516	Sir.
GID00023517	Apprentice.
GID00023518	The reports say Mr. House's robots are now using tech we've never heard of. We need to send a team up there, soon.
GID00023519	Looks like Mr. House is out of the picture. One less thing for us to deal with.
GID00023520	With their leader gone, the Legion will likely tear itself apart. It's what most violent tribal societies do.
GID00023521	Our instruments show some impressive power fluctuations coming from across the river. What's going on over there?
GID00023522	There was a huge explosion east of the Colorado a little while ago. Does the NCR have any artillery that big?
GID00023523	Someone blew up the monorail the NCR uses to travel to the Strip and back. We should use this time to strike!
GID00023524	Seems the destruction of the monorail didn't slow the NCR down much. How many troops do they have?
GID00023525	There was an attempt on the NCR president's life recently. Too bad it didn't succeed.
GID00023526	Did you hear? Someone actually managed to assassinate the NCR's president! And we just sit here!
GID00023527	The other day I heard some bigwig in the NCR military died. Hopefully it disrupts their chain of command some.
GID00023528	Did you hear about that NCR higher up that died? That he was trying to sabotage them? Hope he wasn't the only one.
GID00023529	Seems the NCR is making friends. We've had reports of them making overtures to some gang in Freeside.
GID00023530	We just had word that the town of Primm is now part of the NCR. At this rate, they'll be running the whole region soon.
GID00023531	I heard some special squad of Rangers is on its way to the Vegas area. I guess the NCR is finally getting serious about fighting the Legion.
GID00023532	There've been reports that the NCR is moving more and more troops into the area.
GID00023533	It's the quiet before the storm up top. For once I'm almost glad we're down here.
GID00023534	I still can't believe we came to terms with the NCR.
GID00023535	Something I can do for you?
GID00023536	What is it?
GID00023537	You got something to say or do you always look like that?
GID00023538	Boyd's in there with a prisoner right now. Boy, is she pissed.
GID00023539	That business at the Tops could never happen here. We don't admit that sort of riff-raff.
GID00023540	I know Benny was murdered, but if you ask me, the real crime was that checkered jacket.
GID00023541	A little bird told me Benny might be gone for good. He must've been in some delightful scandal to have run off so suddenly.
GID00023542	Those Omertas. Always plotting, never relevant. Bravo for putting them in their place like that.
GID00023543	Word has it you were spotted entering the Lucky 38. How ever did you get on that guest list?
GID00023544	Is it me or do the Securitrons seem... sassier?
GID00023545	Whatever has become of Mr. House? He used to send a Securitron to our dinner parties sometimes, like an uninvited but harmless uncle.
GID00023546	There's a rumor going around that you killed Caesar! I'm dying to know... is it true? That he used a hairpiece, I mean?
GID00023547	Caesar may be dead, but I think the toga is here to stay. You simply can't buy better thigh accentuation.
GID00023548	The Kings will be missed. Not by me, of course. But who will buy the food at the Tops now that no one needs it to grease their hair?
GID00023549	It sounds like the Kings made nice with the NCR in Freeside. Seems there was room for two flies on the same bit of dung after all.
GID00023550	Life at the top is immensely satisfying.
GID00023551	You mustn't ask why we wear our masks. We are forbidden to speak of it.
GID00023552	It must be horrible to live in places without luxury.
GID00023553	Lookin' sharp, Ramos.
GID00023554	Hey, Ramos.
GID00023555	Heya Torres.
GID00023556	How's the ol' cage treating you, Torres?
GID00023557	Still breakin' hearts there, I see, Scribe Schuler.
GID00023558	How are you, Scribe Schuler?
GID00023559	I can hardly notice that lazy eye anymore, Watkins.
GID00023560	Watkins.
GID00023561	Don't work too hard there, Ibsen.
GID00023562	You look tired, Ibsen.
GID00023563	Scribe Taggart! It's your favorite student.
GID00023564	Hey Scribe Taggart! Did you get some sun?
GID00023565	Hardin.
GID00023566	Hey! How ya been?
GID00023567	Long time, no see!
GID00023568	Hey!
GID00023569	What's up?
GID00023570	Let's get going!
GID00023571	How did the Legion make it into the power plant?
GID00023572	You need to get to the Legate!
GID00023573	Don't shoot!
GID00023574	Please don't kill me!
GID00023575	Watch your step, sister.
GID00023576	If you can't keep that thing under control, I will.
GID00023577	I've never seen a ghoul up close. Not sure I wanted to.
GID00023578	Make my day, mutant.
GID00023579	I can take care of that robot problem for you. Just saying.
GID00023580	Whatever you're selling, we have plenty.
GID00023581	Once a republican, always a republican.
GID00023582	You aren't stealing our medicine, are you, doc?
GID00023583	You should get out of my face before you get yourself hurt.
GID00023584	I don't know how you survived the bombardment. That's incredible.
GID00023585	I'm happy you came along. You are the answer to our dreams.
GID00023586	I can't believe we may see the superfortress built in my lifetime.
GID00023587	Really? So we may see our dream of flight soon?
GID00023588	I hear you're going to help us, I hope you're up for the task.
GID00023589	I'm happy that we managed to raise the bomber in my lifetime.
GID00023590	Thank you so much for your help.
GID00023591	I didn't think the day would ever come, but thanks to you our dreams have come true!
GID00023592	I'm amazed that an outsider has proven so helpful.
GID00023593	You've given us the ability to touch the sky! Thank you.
GID00023594	You've done us a great service. Thank you.
GID00023595	You've done us a great service. Thank you for your help.
GID00023596	I'm not going to take anything from you. Leave me alone!
GID00023597	Hey! You tried to get me sick!
GID00023598	You should learn to give kids nice things... Like toys!
GID00023599	You're the one that tried to give me that yucky stuff.
GID00023600	I don't think I should talk to you. You aren't very nice.
GID00023601	You need to leave me alone. I don't like you anymore.
GID00023602	I like you, we should play sometime!
GID00023603	Thanks for the toy! It was great!
GID00023604	Yay! I love my new toy!
GID00023605	I'm going to play raise the B-29!
GID00023606	Sorry, no time to talk, Outsider.
GID00023607	Sorry, no time to talk, Outsider.
GID00023608	Nice day we're having.
GID00023609	That Fiend leader got what he fucking deserved.
GID00023610	Fuck that Fiend bastard. Wish I would've seen him die.
GID00023611	Can't help thinking that we've not seen the last of the Fiends yet.
GID00023612	I hope the Fiends have learned their lesson.
GID00023613	Won't have to worry about those Fiend assholes for some time now, huh?
GID00023614	I heard Mr. House's done for. I hope the Sewers don't turn for the worse.
GID00023615	We should reclaim the rest of city, if the rumors about House are true.
GID00023616	It's too bad the NCR boss got out alive.
GID00023617	Even Presidents die, huh? Good.
GID00023618	Caesar's death don't change shit down here.
GID00023619	That Legion boss would've never taken the city, but I'm glad he's a goner.
GID00023620	Wonder if we can move into the Sewers under the Strip now that Mr. House is outta business.
GID00023621	The wind's changing. I can see trouble ahead.
GID00023622	If there's war in the end, it won't affect our city.
GID00023623	Rumors of imminent war have made it all the way down here.
GID00023624	Going to stay down here until all the trouble outside blows over.
GID00023625	Looks like the entire region's going straight where we are - knee-deep in shit.
GID00023626	Only one bad thing about the Thorn, it brings all the idiots, assholes and topsiders down here.
GID00023627	Going to place me a good bet at The Thorn.
GID00023628	One of these days, Red Lucy's going to show off her Deathclaws.
GID00023629	All hell broke loose when the creatures escaped from The Thorn!
GID00023630	Can't believe that The Thorn's no more.
GID00023631	Can't believe that The Thorn's no more.
GID00023632	Red Lucy was a fine warrior, and a beautiful woman.
GID00023633	We'll miss Red Lucy down here.
GID00023634	The Hostetlers have gone through quite some trouble, lately.
GID00023635	Terrible thing, what happened to the Hostetlers.
GID00023636	Fiends don't come here no more, they say.
GID00023637	I bet NCR troops can't wait to clean the sewers.
GID00023638	New Vegas, paradise, my ass.
GID00023639	NCR came all the way to save us, huh? Guess they missed the shit-holes.
GID00023640	NCR should head back to their lands, I'm sure *their* people miss them.
GID00023641	Stay underground at night.
GID00023642	Watch out where you exit. Sewers can lead you to Fiend territory.
GID00023643	Keep an eye on your stuff. Damn thieves.
GID00023644	Don't go too far, it's all shadows and dangers in the lower levels.
GID00023645	Careful with those Fiends in the western sewers.
GID00023646	I need my fix.
GID00023647	I hurt all over.
GID00023648	Going to eat the next fucking rat I see.
GID00023649	Just got to find me some sweet Jet.
GID00023650	Won't ever make enough to live outside.
GID00023651	Can't go anywhere else.
GID00023652	Don't think I'll make it topside any time soon.
GID00023653	Smells like shit all the time, but at least we're safer than in the Wastes.
GID00023654	Beats being on patrol.
GID00023655	Just lost a month's caps...
GID00023656	Fucking Crocker couldn't find his ass if it wasn't on his backside...
GID00023657	Don't be carrying any guns into the casino.
GID00023658	Love how this place comes alive at night.
GID00023659	You should see this place at night.
GID00023660	Looking to lose a few caps, huh? Just the place.
GID00023661	The bots have enough firepower to arm a full platoon.
GID00023662	I won't be missing Mr. House, that's a given. The Strip's better off without him.
GID00023663	It was a matter of time before someone got to Mr. House.
GID00023664	NCR should take this chance, now that Mr. House's out of the way.
GID00023665	Good riddance, Caesar! We can finally enjoy some R&R without worrying about a Legion attack at McCarran.
GID00023666	I tell you, something stinks about this Monorail attack!
GID00023667	My buddies at McCarran will find the asshole that destroyed our Monorail.
GID00023668	Once I'm done here, I hope they assign me to find the son of a bitch that took down our President.
GID00023669	I heard it got nasty at the Tops; wish I could've seen the shooting.
GID00023670	My buddies at Camp McCarran are breathing easy now that the Fiends' leader is dead.
GID00023671	Without leadership, the Fiends are as good as dead!
GID00023672	Traveling into the Strip just got a lot easier now that the Fiends' leaders are dead.
GID00023673	Traveling into the Strip just got a lot easier now that the Fiends' leaders are dead.
GID00023674	Shame about the fighting at the Tops; it's got the best patrons around here, hands down!
GID00023675	Shame about the fighting at the Tops; it's got the best patrons around here, hands down!
GID00023676	Kimball's dead, I wonder how long until the Legion's at our walls.
GID00023677	Kimball's dead, I wonder how long until the Legion's at our walls.
GID00023678	It's amazing that Kimball managed to survive.
GID00023679	If someone can blow up the Monorail, I guess we're not safe even in the Strip.
GID00023680	If someone can blow up the Monorail, I guess we're not safe even in the Strip.
GID00023681	How the hell did the monorail blow up? Someone's bringing back luck into the Strip, I tell you.
GID00023682	How the hell did the monorail blow up? Someone's bringing back luck into the Strip, I tell you.
GID00023683	Someone got Mr. House. The Strip's going to change, I'd bet on it.
GID00023684	Someone got Mr. House. The Strip's going to change, I'd bet on it.
GID00023685	After what happened to Mr. House, nobody knows for sure what's in play for the Strip.
GID00023686	After what happened to Mr. House, nobody knows for sure what's in play for the Strip.
GID00023687	The tables turned for Mr. House. What next, huh?
GID00023688	The tables turned for Mr. House. What next, huh?
GID00023689	Looks like Mr. House run out of luck, huh?
GID00023690	Looks like Mr. House run out of luck, huh?
GID00023691	These bots now have eyes on their backs, I swear!
GID00023692	These bots now have eyes on their backs, I swear!
GID00023693	Those punks at Gomorrah got what they deserved.
GID00023694	Come on... time to get lucky.
GID00023695	Come on... time to get lucky.
GID00023696	Luck's about to change, I can feel it.
GID00023697	Luck's about to change, I can feel it.
GID00023698	Almost outta caps...
GID00023699	Almost outta caps...
GID00023700	Damn slots are robbery.
GID00023701	The robots here look different than others I've seen.
GID00023702	The robots here look different than others I've seen.
GID00023703	Wish I could've seen what's inside the 38.
GID00023704	Wish I could've seen what's inside the 38.
GID00023705	Did you hear? Gomorrah's under new management!
GID00023706	Did you hear? Gomorrah's under new management!
GID00023707	You turned around?
GID00023708	You turned around?
GID00023709	Watch your caps - they go quick.
GID00023710	Watch your caps - they go quick.
GID00023711	Seeing the sights?
GID00023712	Seeing the sights?
GID00023713	Vegas at night is like nothing else.
GID00023714	Vegas at night is like nothing else.
GID00023715	Who would have thought a place like this would exist?
GID00023716	Who would have thought a place like this would exist?
GID00023717	At this rate, one Securitron is going to be enough to defend the whole Strip.
GID00023718	Help you?
GID00023719	What is it?
GID00023720	Monorail transit is safe transit.
GID00023721	Report any suspicious activity near the Monorail.
GID00023722	No loitering.
GID00023723	Please enjoy the casinos.
GID00023724	Please do not stand in the fountains.
GID00023725	No violence is permitted on the Strip.
GID00023726	Obedience is virtuous.
GID00023727	Please obey all weapon laws.
GID00023728	Continuing patrol.
GID00023729	Strip secure.
GID00023730	Hey, good going with that hit on The Tops.
GID00023731	That prick, Benny, had it coming.
GID00023732	I always suspected Benny was a coward.
GID00023733	You must have some serious brass to fight off Benny's goons. Bravo.
GID00023734	You made a real mess of the Omertas. Looks like the place will be under new management now.
GID00023735	You must have some real pull with House to get inside the Lucky 38.
GID00023736	Have you seen the new Securitron upgrades? I pity anyone who gets testy with those bots now.
GID00023737	The Lucky 38 has been quiet. I wonder if something happened to House.
GID00023738	Have you noticed the Securitrons acting up? People are saying House might be dead.
GID00023739	Hey, you're the one who slayed Caesar! That son of a bitch had it coming!
GID00023740	People say Caesar is dead. I hope someone worse doesn't replace him.
GID00023741	Good going destroying House's Securitron Army. That old boy's had too much power for too long.
GID00023742	Great, with the monorail bombed, Freeside is the only route in and out of Vegas.
GID00023743	At least the local vendors are seeing more business with these wealthy NCR shits wandering through.
GID00023744	I hear some Legionary named Silus got freed from McCarran. He's got quite the NCR kill count.
GID00023745	Why didn't you just let Kimball get killed? What did he ever do for us to warrant saving his life?
GID00023746	You must have thought you were hot shit going after Kimball like that, huh?
GID00023747	I hear you bagged kimball. Damn fine work, kid.
GID00023748	Some President Kimball was. Chalk up another death to NCR incompetence.
GID00023749	Good riddance. With Chief Hanlon dead, that's one less officer to lead the NCR troops.
GID00023750	Too bad Hanlon is dead. It turns out he was trying to get the NCR out of the Mojave.
GID00023751	The Fiends have been less organized with Motor Runner gone. Good riddance.
GID00023752	Shouldn't be long before the Fiends are wiped out, now that their bosses are gone.
GID00023753	Did you hear? The Legion attacked Bitter Springs!
GID00023754	Did you hear the Khans signed a treaty with NCR? I wonder how that happened.
GID00023755	People say the Khans got wiped out at Red Rock. That's one less bunch of crazies to worry about.
GID00023756	The Great Khans moved out. One less mob of degenerates to worry about, if you ask me.
GID00023757	Crazy Khan bastards. What were they thinking attacking the dam like that?
GID00023758	With the Kings gone, Freeside is going to be a real mess.
GID00023759	The Kings are working with NCR? What's this place coming to?
GID00023760	People are talking, buddy. You've made quite an impression on The Strip.
GID00023761	The Rangers are getting reinforcements? I hope they don't decide to bring the battle to Freeside.
GID00023762	Things look to be building up on either side of the dam. This doesn't look good.
GID00023763	The legion is bad enough. The last thing we needed around here is even tougher NCR Ranger thugs coming along.
GID00023764	It looks like the Legion and NCR are getting ready for a fight. I hope that doesn't end badly for us.
GID00023765	I hope the NCR have the manpower to defend the dam. It looks like the Legion are going to attack soon.
GID00023766	Without you, we'd all be slaves. Thanks for helping the NCR at the dam.
GID00023767	As if House didn't have enough control already. At least we don't have to deal with NCR or the Legion, now.
GID00023768	Hello there.
GID00023769	How's it going?
GID00023770	Howdy.
GID00023771	Hey.
GID00023772	Good day.
GID00023773	Yep.
GID00023774	Howdy, Arcade.
GID00023775	Another NCR grunt.
GID00023776	Good to see another strong-willed woman around.
GID00023777	That is one odd robot.
GID00023778	A Super mutant in Freeside?
GID00023779	That has to be the oldest Ghoul I've ever seen.
GID00023780	What's up Rex?
GID00023781	What's your problem, lady?
GID00023782	I've got my eye on you.
GID00023783	Well hello, pretty lady.
GID00023784	Good day.
GID00023785	Hey yeah. Hi.
GID00023786	Was that a guy or a gal? Aw hell, I need to stop drinking.
GID00023787	Ugh?
GID00023788	What the hell? I didn't eat any corn this week.
GID00023789	Ya got any grog?!
GID00023790	Ya got any change, man? I've got two kids to feed.
GID00023791	Ya got any change, man? I've got three kids to feed.
GID00023792	Ya got any change, man? I've got seven kids to feed.
GID00023793	Woooooo!
GID00023794	You seen Gourd around?
GID00023795	Oh, I don't think last night's rat is agreeing with me.
GID00023796	Hey lady! I know you've got some hooch somewhere in there!
GID00023797	Hey! Nice hat, nancy boy!
GID00023798	Oh, my head is killing me. I need another drink.
GID00023799	<Whistling>
GID00023800	I swear Dixon's hooch is killing me.
GID00023801	Dixon's hooch may be cheap, but it tastes like it was filtered through a dirty sock.
GID00023802	Hey baby, I got what you need right here! <Burp>
GID00023803	Hey baby, I got what you need right here! <Burp>
GID00023804	Just give us an excuse. Been too long since I fired my weapon.
GID00023805	Don't go fucking about, asshole.
GID00023806	Mess with any of the equipment here and I'll mount your head on a stick.
GID00023807	Just try pulling some of your Brahmin shit here at the Dorado and see what happens.
GID00023808	Not much happens here at the Dorado, and that's how we like it.
GID00023809	Only combat I seen lately was shooting some Geckos.
GID00023810	All the juice from Hoover flows right through the Dorado, and we send it west to keep the home lights burning.
GID00023811	We keep an eye out for Legion raiding parties. They'd love to shut down the Dorado.
GID00023812	My folks back home got lights at night thanks to what we're doing here.
GID00023813	Just stay out of the control room and enclosure.
GID00023814	The power transmission cables are all underground. Good thing, or the old war might've knocked them down.
GID00023815	You visiting every NCR post just to see the sights? This here's the Dorado - it's where we send power back home.
GID00023816	Look all you want, just don't mess with any of the equipment. The control room's off-limits, and so is the enclosure.
GID00023817	You watch yourself. You cause any more trouble and you'll be dead.
GID00023818	Any more funny business and we'll kill you.
GID00023819	Watch yourself. I don't want to have to kill you, but I will if I have to.
GID00023820	I got kicked outta Ultra Luxe the other day. Man, that place gives me the fucking creeps.
GID00023821	Business is good. All the Families got money. Of course Gomorrah is where the action is.
GID00023822	I'm glad they don't let just any motherfucker through the gate. Freeside smells like shit.
GID00023823	Fiends are bad for business. NCR should do their fucking job.
GID00023824	There's some serious shit going on between NCR and the Legion. They better not fuck with our power.
GID00023825	Fuck Not-At-Home, must be cozy up there in the Lucky 38.
GID00023826	Bosses don't like no trouble in their place.
GID00023827	Gomorrah is always open for Business.
GID00023828	Find yourself a girl or a guy. Have some fun.
GID00023829	I think there is something wrong with that dog.
GID00023830	Uh, I don't think we allow her kind in here. I'll let it go this time though.
GID00023831	Your ghoul wants to have some fun he can, we don't discriminate.
GID00023832	Your ghoul wants to have some fun he can, we don't discriminate.
GID00023833	What the fuck is that thing?
GID00023834	Big tough ranger better not start any trouble in here.
GID00023835	Let me know if the pretty lady with you is looking for some work.
GID00023836	That Follower fucker is going to have some trouble if he tries to liberate any of our employees.
GID00023837	Kings sold out to the NCR huh? Might be worth a sit down with them.
GID00023838	Word on the street is something big is about to go down at Hoover Dam.
GID00023839	I hear you been making some waves around here.
GID00023840	I hear the Legion is moving some new tough muscle into the area. NCR better keep their heads down.
GID00023841	Kings were small time. Not surprised they got themselves iced.
GID00023842	Those fucking Monkey Khans joined the NCR? I can't believe they finally got themselves civilized.
GID00023843	Khans finally got what they had coming. Glad we won't have to worry about them again.
GID00023844	You hear what happened over at Bitter Springs? Not too pretty.
GID00023845	Kimball managed to get himself knocked off. Serves him right.
GID00023846	I hear Kimball dodged a bullet there.
GID00023847	The NCR seems none too happy about losing their little train.
GID00023848	Glad that fucker House is gone.
GID00023849	Woah, the great Caesar is dead. The management doesn't seem too happy.
GID00023850	House? More like House light. I heard he got himself unplugged.
GID00023851	Holy shit, you been in Lucky 38? You meet the Overboss in there?
GID00023852	Shit, I can't believe Cachino betrayed the Family.
GID00023853	Nice work at the Tops buddy.
GID00023854	What the fuck are you looking at?
GID00023855	Be sure to check out the courtyard, some of the hottest asses in New Vegas shaking out there.
GID00023856	You know you want a piece of this, give me some sugar.
GID00023857	I don't think that's what they mean by doggy style.
GID00023858	Mmm, I haven't had a ghoul before. Do I get to keep the tip?
GID00023859	Ooo, the big one looks like fun. Let me know if you want a good time.
GID00023860	Hey sexy lady, looking for a good time?
GID00023861	Hey big guy, looking for a good time?
GID00023862	Gomorrah has the loosest slots on the Strip.
GID00023863	Welcome back to Gomorrah, find yourself a girl or a guy, and have a drink. You're family.
GID00023864	Welcome back to Gomorrah, find yourself a girl or a guy, and have a drink. You're family.
GID00023865	Did Benny beg before you burned his sorry ass?
GID00023866	Did Benny beg before you burned his sorry ass?
GID00023867	I hear you chased that chicken shit Benny off. Good riddance.
GID00023868	I hear you chased that chicken shit Benny off. Good riddance.
GID00023869	Things are good since Cachino took over.
GID00023870	Things are good since Cachino took over.
GID00023871	Hot damn do I love this place.
GID00023872	This place smells like booze and sex. That's why I always come back.
GID00023873	I hope my dad doesn't find out how much money those hookers cost me.
GID00023874	The Tops is a real snooze fest. I hope they get some new shows soon.
GID00023875	Don't walk away, let me show you the time of your life.
GID00023876	I tell you, Not-At-Home is gonna have his day.
GID00023877	How very nice to make your acquaintance. I'm your new Robobutler.
GID00023878	It appears you've been wounded, sir. May I suggest you utilitze your infirmary?
GID00023879	It appears you've been wounded, sir. May I suggest you seek medical attention as soon as possible?
GID00023880	You appear to have been wounded, madame. May I suggest you utilitze your infirmary?
GID00023881	It appears you've been wounded, madame. May I suggest you seek medical attention as soon as possible?
GID00023882	I hope things are going well for you today, sir.
GID00023883	I hope things are going well for you today, madame.
GID00023884	Welcome home, sir.
GID00023885	Welcome home, madame.
GID00023886	It's good to see you alive and well, sir.
GID00023887	It's good to see you alive and well, madame.
GID00023888	That's the mook that killed Benny!
GID00023889	That's the guy who killed Caesar!
GID00023890	That's the chick who killed Caesar!
GID00023891	Ain't you the cat that tried to ice the President? Gutsy, baby, showing your face in here.
GID00023892	Ain't that the cat that tried to ice the President? Gutsy fella, showing his face in here.
GID00023893	Ain't that the bird that tried to ice the President? Gutsy dame, showing her face in here.
GID00023894	Ave, true to Caesar.
GID00023895	True to Caesar.
GID00023896	True to Caesar.
GID00023897	I wouldn't mind hitting that, does she put out?
GID00023898	My buddy saw some sort of elite ranger squad the other day. They took out his group from a quarter mile off.
GID00023899	I hear someone killed Motor-Runner.
GID00023900	More tough Securitrons? Shit, now we really got to stay the fuck outta the Strip.
GID00023901	I need to get some more chems.
GID00023902	I'm getting the shakes. I need something to take the edge off.
GID00023903	Damn, I think I got some bad shit.
GID00023904	Get the fuck out of my face.
GID00023905	What the fuck are you looking at?
GID00023906	Goddamn, I need a fix.
GID00023907	Hey, got any Jet?
GID00023908	Kimball had it coming. Maybe the NCR will learn to stay the fuck out of other people's business.
GID00023909	That NCR president somehow managed to survive a Legion hit.
GID00023910	Motor Runner is dead? Who the fuck is going to be running the show now?
GID00023911	Are the Khans going to keep selling us shit, if they join the Legion?
GID00023912	House unplugged like a light. Wonder if he twitched before he bit it.
GID00023913	House unplugged like a light. Wonder if he twitched before he bit it.
GID00023914	The Khans are all gone, wonder if they left behind their shit for making our goods.
GID00023915	The Khans are all gone, wonder if they left behind their shit for making our goods.
GID00023916	Fuck, where are we gonna get our shit from now that the Khans are all buddy buddy with the NCR.
GID00023917	Fuck, where are we gonna get our shit from now that the Khans are all buddy buddy with the NCR.
GID00023918	NCR is going to be rip shit about losing their little train.
GID00023919	Someone is targeting us, I'm gonna kill that fucker if we find out who did it.
GID00023920	Someone is targeting us, I'm gonna kill that fucker if we find out who did it.
GID00023921	Someone is targeting us, I'm gonna kill that fucker if we find out who did it.
GID00023922	Primm is going to be much tougher to push around with that new sheriff down there.
GID00023923	Primm is going to be much tougher to push around with that new sheriff down there.
GID00023924	A flying robot? Man, I must be fucked up.
GID00023925	Is that Mean Sonofabitch? They all look the same to me.
GID00023926	Is that Mean Sonofabitch? They all look the same to me.
GID00023927	Your pet ghoul smells like ass.
GID00023928	Your pet ghoul smells like ass.
GID00023929	Things are tense on the Strip right now. The head of one of Mr. House's Families was killed. Time to lay low, you ask me.
GID00023930	You got something you want to say?
GID00023931	Yeah?
GID00023932	May I help you?
GID00023933	Hey, what's up?
GID00023934	Hey, pal.
GID00023935	Hey, doll.
GID00023936	Look who it is. Freeside's favorite son.
GID00023937	Look who it is. Freeside's leading lady.
GID00023938	Hey, it's good to see you.
GID00023939	Hey there. You're the King's friend, right?
GID00023940	You here to start trouble?
GID00023941	You in the right neighborhood?
GID00023942	I'd keep moving, if I were you.
GID00023943	You know, I was just talking about trash, and here you are.
GID00023944	Don't think the shit you've pulled has been forgotten.
GID00023945	You want some of this?
GID00023946	Personal space meaning anything to you, guy?
GID00023947	Personal space meaning anything to you, lady?
GID00023948	Going to the Wrangler tonight?
GID00023949	Hey man, what are you up to?
GID00023950	Heard there was some excitement in one of the casinos in the Strip. Bunch of people got hurt when some nut started attacking people.
GID00023951	Some nut attempted to kill the head of one of Mr. House's Families recently. Whoever did it is either crazy or has balls the size of Freeside.
GID00023952	Did you hear someone managed to fight their way through the Chairmen and flee the Strip after being caught? Wonder if they're hiding out in Freeside.
GID00023953	Looks like Gomorrah's under new management. I wonder what happened?
GID00023954	There's talk of someone going into the Lucky 38 to talk to Mr. House. That's bullshit. Everyone knows Mr. House doesn't talk to anyone.
GID00023955	Man, I thought these tin cans of Mr. House's were tough before. Have you seen the shit they can do now?
GID00023956	Is it true? Is Mr. House gone?
GID00023957	Word on the street is that the leader of the Legion bought it. Too bad, someone was finally going to do something about all the NCR around here.
GID00023958	There was some some kind of explosion to the east a little while ago. Has the fighting started?
GID00023959	Did you hear? Someone bombed the monorail down at McCarran, so everyone's been forced to come through here to get to the Strip. Business is booming.
GID00023960	Seems like they've got things straightened out in McCarran now, but we're still seeing a big increase in traffic here.
GID00023961	I can't believe someone stopped the NCR president from getting killed. If anyone deserves it, it's that jerk.
GID00023962	Someone took a shot at the NCR president, but the lucky bastard got away. Oh well, it was a good try.
GID00023963	Hey, did you hear the NCR president got whacked? Good for whoever did it, I say. Couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.
GID00023964	There's mutterings from the NCR people around here that some local hero of theirs died. Whatever.
GID00023965	Turns out some military hero the Squatters admired was actually a slimeball. An NCR soldier who's actually a dick? Who would've thought?
GID00023966	Heh, word is the leader of the Fiends got taken down. I would have done it myself, it he ever had the courage to step into Freeside.
GID00023967	I heard that some of the bosses of the Fiends were killed. Wouldn't be surprised if the NCR had something to do with it.
GID00023968	You hear the Legion attacked Bitter Springs? If we're lucky, the NCR will pull some of their soldiers away from here and send them that way.
GID00023969	Word is the Khans signed a treaty with the NCR. Never saw that coming.
GID00023970	The Khans used to be a big deal around here, but look at them now. There's talk that they were all killed up in the mountains.
GID00023971	Weird, someone just told me that the Khans split the Vegas area. Wonder where they went, and why.
GID00023972	I can't believe the King is dead. What's going to happen to us now?
GID00023973	If you had asked me a month ago, I'd have said we'd never willingly work with the NCR. But look at us now.
GID00023974	I still can't believe the King agreed to work with the NCR. But he's the King, and the King knows best.
GID00023975	So far working with the NCR hasn't been too bad. If anything, things seem to be getting better.
GID00023976	Great, just when you think the NCR can't possibly sink their claws deeper, the town of Primm signs up to join the Republic.
GID00023977	Sounds like the NCR and the Legion are both gearing up for a fight. Been seeing a lot more soldiers around.
GID00023978	The big showdown between the NCR and the Legion is coming soon, believe you me.
GID00023979	I heard some Squatters talking about some fancy pants Rangers coming into the area soon. Like we need more NCR here.
GID00023980	Word is those tough guys rangers are here. I ain't seen them myself, but how scary can they be?
GID00023981	Everyone's talking about Hoover Dam nowadays. I wish the battle would just happen already. The suspense is killing me.
GID00023982	Hey, isn't that the King's dog?
GID00023983	If it isn't Rex! Haven't seen you in a while, boy.
GID00023984	Hey Rexie, who's a good dog?
GID00023985	I owe you Follower people a beer for patching me up a while back.
GID00023986	What are you looking at?
GID00023987	Great, another fuckin' robot.
GID00023988	Hello, cutie.
GID00023989	What's a pretty girl like you doing with someone like this?
GID00023990	You need a boyfriend, honey?
GID00023991	You want to have some fun with a real man, baby?
GID00023992	Want a massage, cutie? No charge.
GID00023993	Buy you a drink, honey?
GID00023994	Um, er, excuse me. I'll just get out of your way.
GID00023995	Hey baby. Wanna get wild tonight?
GID00023996	Wanna come back to my place? I've got my own mattress and everything.
GID00023997	What's the rush, baby? Stay awhile.
GID00023998	Why not try following me around for a while, darling? I'll take you someplace nice.
GID00023999	You're not from around here, right?
GID00024000	You're going the wrong way, beautiful. My place is the other way.
GID00024001	Hey, baby. I know a quiet place we can be alone. Or a loud place if you're one of those.
GID00024002	Hey.
GID00024003	What's up?
GID00024004	Hi.
GID00024005	I'm glad the President is still here to help us settle in these new territories.
GID00024006	House's dead, this time for good!
GID00024007	The time to assert our rule over the territories has come.
GID00024008	If the Legion can equip their men so well, maybe they can take care of me too.
GID00024009	NCR will civilize all this Wasteland, Primm is only the beginning.
GID00024010	I hope the Fiends stop their raids now that their boss is gone
GID00024011	Bad weather ahead, I tell you. The death of our President's just the start.
GID00024012	I've heard that Securitrons are nastier than ever.
GID00024013	Sounds like Mr. House is in some kind of trouble.
GID00024014	After all, Caesar died like the old man he was.
GID00024015	After all, Caesar died like the old man he was.
GID00024016	That Caesar bastard had it coming.
GID00024017	That Caesar bastard had it coming.
GID00024018	I'm glad those damn bots are gone for good.
GID00024019	I'm glad those damn bots are gone for good.
GID00024020	Someone blew up the Monorail, right by our troops!
GID00024021	Someone blew up the Monorail, right by our troops!
GID00024022	Our guys put the Monorail back to work!

GID00024024	I hear some asshole freed our enemy from McCarran.
GID00024025	I hear some asshole freed our enemy from McCarran.
GID00024026	Can you believe they tried killing our President? Don't they know who they are dealing with?
GID00024027	Can you believe they tried killing our President? Don't they know who they are dealing with?
GID00024028	Our own President, murdered! Things aren't looking good.
GID00024029	Our own President, murdered! Things aren't looking good.
GID00024030	Hanlon was a brave soldier, what could've driven him to despair?
GID00024031	Hanlon was a brave soldier, what could've driven him to despair?
GID00024032	Did you hear about Hanlon? What a blow!
GID00024033	Did you hear about Hanlon? What a blow!
GID00024034	That Fiend leader shouldn't have messed with our great army.
GID00024035	That Fiend leader shouldn't have messed with our great army.
GID00024036	The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
GID00024037	If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
GID00024038	If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
GID00024039	Those Khans are savages, but we can use them to our advantage.
GID00024040	Those Khans are savages, but we can use them to our advantage.
GID00024041	Khans are history, it serves them right!
GID00024042	Khans are history, it serves them right!
GID00024043	Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
GID00024044	Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
GID00024045	I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
GID00024046	I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
GID00024047	I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
GID00024048	I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
GID00024049	Those Freeside thugs aren't worth our time anymore.
GID00024050	Those Freeside thugs aren't worth our time anymore.
GID00024051	I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
GID00024052	Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
GID00024053	Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
GID00024054	War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
GID00024055	War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
GID00024056	Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
GID00024057	Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
GID00024058	Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
GID00024059	Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
GID00024060	I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.

GID00024066	Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
GID00024067	Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
GID00024068	Did you know The Strip's all stirred up, lately?
GID00024069	Things are getting stranger every day.

GID00024162	The ground in Forlorn Hope was soaked red, from the blood of our own people!

GID00024189	We got ourselves a little Ranger family reunion now. Time's right for a feud.
GID00024190	Monster of the East, huh? Well I've got the Monster of the West in my holster right now. Hope I get to introduce them.
GID00024191	A veteran Ranger inspires awe. Stick around for when they get here, you'll see. If I live to earn the Black Armor, I can die a happy woman.
GID00024192	First Recon's in Camp Forlorn Hope. Get some Rangers in there too and it'll be a damned impregnable fortress.
GID00024193	Wish I could've been there, defending Camp Forlorn Hope. Even if it didn't change anything.
GID00024194	Looks like we booted the Legion outta Nelson. About damn time.
GID00024195	From here on out, we fight for Chief Hanlon.
GID00024196	President Kimball was a tough son-of-a-gun. The Rangers'll pick up where he left off.
GID00024197	President Kimball was a soldier's soldier. It's up to us to make the Legion pay for what they did.
GID00024198	You saved President Kimball, didn't you? Hell of a thing.
GID00024199	Don't get many chances to catch a legionary alive. Burns me up that we botched ours.
GID00024200	All you need is one Ranger protecting the monorail. You don't even need to feed him that much. He'll get it done.
GID00024201	Wish I had a First Recon guy looking after me.
GID00024202	Hoover Dam... just thinking about it makes me nervous.
GID00024203	One of the Ranger vets looked at me and I just about surrendered.
GID00024204	The Ranger vets are on their way from Baja. Never seen one before. But I've heard they chew nails and spit napalm.
GID00024205	We put our trust in Hanlon and look where it got us. Makes you wonder if we can trust anyone at all.
GID00024206	Chief Hanlon's watching over us now. He won't let us lose.
GID00024207	They got to President Kimball. How long can we hold out?
GID00024208	Oh my God, are you the one who saved President Kimball?
GID00024209	I heard we captured a live Centurion and then let him get away. That never would've happened if I was in charge.
GID00024210	No monorail access to the Strip? Where am I supposed to take my leave? Freeside?
GID00024211	We won't go quietly. The Legion can count on that.
GID00024212	Sounds like we're running Primm now. I'd still rather take my leave at the Strip.
GID00024213	First Recon's at Camp Forlorn Hope. Now we've got a chance to hold it.
GID00024214	Nelson's back in our hands. I hope we can defend it this time.
GID00024215	Is it me, or has the Brotherhood stopped engaging us? Smartest move they ever made, you ask me.
GID00024216	Smart move for the Kings to back down. They didn't know who they were messing with.
GID00024217	We signed a treaty with the Great Khans. Guess you can never have too many lowlife chem dealers on your side.
GID00024218	Sickens me that the Legion would try to harvest slaves from a refugee camp.
GID00024219	President Kimball is lucky he escaped. I don't think we could lose him right now.
GID00024220	Wish I could've been there to see Caesar die. What an asshole.
GID00024221	Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter.
GID00024222	Keeping the Strip secure has been hell since the monorail was taken out.
GID00024223	Did you hear about that Legion POW escape? I don't like our chances of taking him alive twice.
GID00024224	They're talking about you on the radio. Saving President Kimball. I'm impressed.
GID00024225	How could we lose Kimball at a time like this?
GID00024226	Chief Hanlon was a model soldier. We all looked up to him.
GID00024227	Too bad about Chief Hanlon. He did what he thought was best for us.
GID00024228	Without Camp Forlorn Hope, it's a matter of time before the Legion surrounds us at the Dam.
GID00024229	This whole war's gonna change when the Ranger veterans get here. Soon as we see the Black Armor, we can all breathe easier.
GID00024230	A platoon of veteran Rangers is like a tactical nuke, only tougher to scare.
GID00024231	This battle... everything's riding on it.
GID00024232	That red beret's looking good, soldier.
GID00024233	The security lapse with the monorail is a huge embarrassment.
GID00024234	That POW escape presents some real security concerns. That was our base camp, for crying out loud.
GID00024235	There's something fishy about how Chief Hanlon died. It just doesn't add up.
GID00024236	Can't believe Hanlon was working against us.
GID00024237	No hope of securing the border now that Forlorn Hope fell.
GID00024238	The Ranger veterans have been running ops in Baja. We'll be a different army with them here.
GID00024239	We've got our best Rangers here now. All of a sudden I like our chances a whole lot better.
GID00024240	If we lose Hoover Dam, we can kiss Nevada goodbye.
GID00024241	The bosses of the Omergas? Omer-nas? The ones that run Gomorrah? Someone killed them.
GID00024242	So I hear the honcho of one of them Strip families up and disappeared - poof! Yeah, they'll find his body someday...
GID00024243	So I hear the honcho of one of them Strip families up and disappeared - poof! Yeah, they'll find his body someday...

GID00024245	You hear there was some kinda shoot-out at one of them casinos on the Strip? Some people got killed or something.
GID00024246	That tower on the Strip, the one you can see for miles? I hear it ain't sealed-up no more.
GID00024247	That tower on the Strip, the one you can see for miles? I hear it ain't sealed-up no more.
GID00024248	That tower on the Strip popped open like a can and let somebody walk right in. Mark my words - some evil's afoot.
GID00024249	They say those robots on the Strip are running around with different faces or something. Don't ask, because I don't know...
GID00024250	They say those robots on the Strip are running around with different faces or something. Don't ask, because I don't know...
GID00024251	Those robots on the Strip, Securi-troids or what have you? Well, they been acting different or something.
GID00024252	The same robots on the Strip, I seen one or two of them roll past town time to time. Well, the face on them looked meaner.
GID00024253	Usually I don't talk to nobody but robots.But lately some of them been two-faced.
GID00024254	A customer who been to the Strip told me the faces on the robots there changed from police to soldiers. Now why would that be?
GID00024255	That tower on the Strip popped open like a can and let somebody walk right in. Mark my words - some evil's afoot.
GID00024256	That Mr. House who lorded over the Strip is dead. Good riddance, I say.
GID00024257	Now that Mr. House's gone, might be opportunities on the Strip for an enterprising merchant.
GID00024258	I bet that Mr. House had a buncha booze in his place. Someone oughta get it out of there. He ain't using it!
GID00024259	If Caesar's dead, why ain't the NCR taking care of regular folks yet?
GID00024260	If Caesar's dead, why ain't the NCR taking care of regular folks yet?
GID00024261	You hear Caesar's dead? Good for trade if the Legion goes away, that's for sure.
GID00024262	I heard Caesar didn't let nobody drink or drug. Probably why he got killed.
GID00024263	Who cares if Caesar's dead? Don't affect our town one bit.
GID00024264	If the NCR ain't got to worry about Caesar no more, it should worry about improving the lives of regular folks around here.
GID00024265	If the NCR ain't got to worry about Caesar no more, it should worry about improving the lives of regular folks around here.
GID00024266	So much for the might of the NCR! Their President got killed over at Hoover Dam!
GID00024267	So much for the might of the NCR! Their President got killed over at Hoover Dam!
GID00024268	You hear how the President of the NCR got killed? Gonna be hard to score chems around here for a while...
GID00024269	Someone tried to kill the NCR President over at Hoover Dam. They say it was Legion.
GID00024270	Someone tried to kill the NCR President over at Hoover Dam. They say it was Legion.
GID00024271	That President Kimball nearly got killed at Hoover Dam. Now he knows how we feel about the NCR around here.
GID00024272	How's the NCR gonna protect Vegas if it can't even protect its own President?
GID00024273	How's the NCR gonna protect Vegas if it can't even protect its own President?
GID00024274	The NCR's top Ranger, Chief Hanlon, put a gun in his mouth. Think he would've done that if the NCR stood a chance at beating the Legion?
GID00024275	The NCR's top Ranger, Chief Hanlon, put a gun in his mouth. Think he would've done that if the NCR stood a chance at beating the Legion?
GID00024276	Turns out the NCR's top Ranger was a traitor! If the Legion can turn a man like Hanlon, what chance has the NCR got?
GID00024277	Turns out the NCR's top Ranger was a traitor! If the Legion can turn a man like Hanlon, what chance has the NCR got?

GID00024283	Those Fiend junkies over at Vault 3 been taking some hits. I say kill them all.
GID00024284	With fewer of them Fiends sucking up the chems, maybe I can finally score a hit now and then.
GID00024285	With those Fiends on the run, I should head over to Vault 3 and see if I can pull some salvage out of there.
GID00024286	The Great Khans signing a treaty with the NCR? I never woulda seen that coming.
GID00024287	The Great Khans signing a treaty with the NCR? I never woulda seen that coming.

GID00024302	First the Legion takes Nelson, then it wipes out Camp Forlorn Hope. The NCR don't stand a chance.

GID00024308	Some Khans got cornered in the ruins of Boulder City, but the NCR let them go. That's unusual.
GID00024309	Primm has a new Sheriff. That should keep the Powder Gangers away.

GID00024324	Mark my words - won't be long before the Legion and NCR butt heads over Hoover Dam.
GID00024325	Nobody knows who's gonna win, Legion or NCR. Might not make much of a difference around here.

GID00024382	Move along, please.
GID00024383	How may I serve you, master?
GID00024384	How may I serve you, mistress?
GID00024385	Another glorious day in this man's army!
GID00024386	What's your problem?
GID00024387	You're funny looking.
GID00024388	Are you talking to me?
GID00024389	Um. Yeah. Please go away.
GID00024390	Hi. How are you today?
GID00024391	Are you okay?

GID00024394	Howdy mister.
GID00024395	Hi there, miss.
GID00024396	Hello.
GID00024397	Hi.
GID00024398	Hi there.
GID00024399	What?
GID00024400	Hi.
GID00024401	Hey.
GID00024402	Evening.
GID00024403	Morning.
GID00024404	Hey.
GID00024405	Hey there.
GID00024406	Yes?
GID00024407	Hello.
GID00024408	Hello.
GID00024410	What the fuck did we do to the Sarge, anyway?
GID00024411	Can't wait to get the hell out of here.
GID00024412	This place stinks!
GID00024413	This sucks.
GID00024414	Might as well do the job right.
GID00024415	Hope those Fiends give us no trouble.
GID00024416	Let's just stay sharp.
GID00024417	This sucks.
GID00024418	Do you think that men go bald normally? I am sick, and I have embraced my change. Leave me be.
GID00024419	That's just the kind of thing I'd be expecting them to say. Which proves you're not with them.
GID00024420	Well, that's a load off. What do you want to know?
GID00024421	No, I don't think I have much to offer in that department either. Too many blows to the head during combat drills.
GID00024422	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00024423	Do that someplace else!
GID00024424	You tryin' to get me killed?
GID00024425	Holster that. And be quick about it.
GID00024426	Holster your iron, pardner!
GID00024427	Quit it!
GID00024428	Stop that!
GID00024429	Hey! Do that somewhere else.
GID00024430	Be careful!
GID00024431	What in tarnation?
GID00024432	What in blazes?
GID00024433	Ammo costs money, you know!
GID00024434	What's wrong with you?
GID00024435	Knock it off!
GID00024436	Quit fuckin' around!
GID00024437	Whoo! Bang bang!
GID00024438	A pulled trigger's a happy trigger!
GID00024439	Yeah! Shoot it again!
GID00024440	What's your problem?
GID00024441	Stop doing that, please.
GID00024442	I'm not sure if you're trying to hit me or trying to miss me. Either way, stop it. Thanks.
GID00024443	Let me aim that for you next time.
GID00024444	Am I gonna have to take that away from you?
GID00024445	Uh, hate to criticize boss, but I'm not actually immortal. Just old.
GID00024446	Come on, boss, I know I'm ugly, but I am on your side.
GID00024447	If you want me to split, you could just say so.
GID00024448	<growl>
GID00024449	Would you keep it down?
GID00024450	Waste of ammo.
GID00024451	What, you see a scorpion?
GID00024452	If you can't control it, keep it in your holster.
GID00024453	You'll put someone's eye out with that, dearie!
GID00024454	It's not nice to do things like that, dear!
GID00024455	This noise is making Leo get antsy!
GID00024456	Stow that weapon, Outsider.
GID00024457	Drop that weapon.
GID00024458	Keep that up, human 
GID00024459	Keep that shit away from me.
GID00024460	What the fuck do you think you're doing.
GID00024461	Whoa, someone's just come from the Wrangler.
GID00024462	Keep it down, would ya? I already got a splitting headache.
GID00024463	Whatever. Knock yourself out, for all I care.
GID00024464	Put that away!
GID00024465	Mind your weapon!
GID00024466	Weapons use is discouraged. Thank you for your cooperation.
GID00024467	Please do not use your weapons. Thank you.
GID00024468	Whoa! Are you like... some kind of crazy person?
GID00024469	Do that again!
GID00024470	Cool. Can I try?
GID00024471	Cut it out, will you?
GID00024472	Whoa, whoa! Careful!
GID00024473	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00024474	How about you line that up on a tin can instead?
GID00024475	Don't even kid about that.
GID00024476	You're lookin' at a heap of trouble if you want it.
GID00024477	If you think you want trouble, then let fly.
GID00024478	Don't even joke like that.
GID00024479	Point that somewhere else!
GID00024480	That safety better be on.
GID00024481	Point that somewhere else.
GID00024482	For pete's sake...
GID00024483	No respect.
GID00024484	Stop that. I mean it!
GID00024485	Quit it. You're making me nervous.
GID00024486	Go ahead. Try me.
GID00024487	Think you're tough, huh?
GID00024488	If you need to shoot me, I won't complain!
GID00024489	Hello! Look what's pointed at me!
GID00024490	Don't worry about me! You can shoot if you want!
GID00024491	How about I aim my gun at you for a while, see how you like it?
GID00024492	I assure you, you look extremely virile. Now, would you mind pointing that somewhere else? Thanks.
GID00024493	Uh... what's up?
GID00024494	You looking for trouble?
GID00024495	Why do we always hurt the ones we care about the most?
GID00024496	You, uhh, you want to point that someplace else, boss? I got enough holes in me.
GID00024497	Boss, why are you looking at me that way?
GID00024498	I wouldn't mind this so much if it weren't for that maniacal gleam in your eye.
GID00024499	<growl>
GID00024500	Pull that trigger, you'll wish you hadn't.
GID00024501	Don't like no one drawing a bead on me.
GID00024502	Better be rocksalt in that, or you're asking for an asskicking.
GID00024503	Don't make me take that away.
GID00024504	Are you drunk?
GID00024505	Pumpkin, don't point that at grandma, there's a dear.
GID00024506	Leo doesn't like that, dearie. You should stop.
GID00024507	You're going to make this easy.
GID00024508	Drop that weapon, Outsider.
GID00024509	Think about too hard and you'll get burned.
GID00024510	Watch where you point that.
GID00024511	I wouldn't.
GID00024512	I don't think so.
GID00024513	Who the fuck do you think you are?
GID00024514	Point that shit somewhere else.
GID00024515	You want to be getting that gun out of my face right now.
GID00024516	That's not funny.
GID00024517	Quit screwing around!
GID00024518	You think I don't see that?
GID00024519	Don't tempt me.
GID00024520	By Caesar, you're walking a fine line.
GID00024521	Be advised, assaulting an officer of the law will not be tolerated.
GID00024522	Be advised, assaulting an officer of the law is a serious offense.
GID00024523	You're not going to shoot me, are you?
GID00024524	Is that loaded? Let me try it!
GID00024525	Hey, I can almost see right down the barrel!
GID00024526	That's not a good idea.
GID00024527	What do you think you're doing?
GID00024528	What? How'd you get past the guards?
GID00024529	They're here! Don't let them get the antidote! Oh. It's just you. You can't have it either.
GID00024530	The molerat men! They've come for my beard at last! Oh. Never mind.
GID00024531	I hope I don't forget that's there.
GID00024532	Hard for me to step lightly with a bum leg.
GID00024533	Now why in tarnation would you put one of those, there.
GID00024534	Guess we best watch where we step.
GID00024535	You sure that's necessary?
GID00024536	What was the point of that?
GID00024537	What the hell? That's dangerous.
GID00024538	Um... why are you setting that there?
GID00024539	That'll show 'em!
GID00024540	Got any more of those?
GID00024541	Hey, you dropped something.
GID00024542	Isn't that a little overkill?
GID00024543	Why the fuck you puttin' that there?
GID00024544	Pick that back up or you'll be eatin' it.
GID00024545	Oooh, you're sneaky!
GID00024546	I'd like to see someone step on that!
GID00024547	I'll watch my step.
GID00024548	Can't wait to see where this is going.
GID00024549	Careful with that.
GID00024550	Careful. Someone could trip on that.
GID00024551	Oh, sure. Lay mines around the arthritic old man who doesn't see so good. Thanks, boss.
GID00024552	Do I hear beeping, boss? I think I hear beeping.
GID00024553	Oh good. Mines.
GID00024554	<bark!>
GID00024555	I'll keep the dancing to a minimum.
GID00024556	That ought to even the odds.
GID00024557	Somebody's ear's going to be ringing.
GID00024558	There's a leg waiting to go.
GID00024559	Gonna be a bad day for somebody.
GID00024560	Ohh, that's very sneaky, dear! I'll be sure not to tell anyone about that mine!
GID00024561	You should pick that up before someone hurts themselves!
GID00024562	I see you, Outsider.
GID00024563	You think that firecracker will be enough?
GID00024564	I saw that!
GID00024565	You take that back!
GID00024566	What are you doing?
GID00024567	I saw that.
GID00024568	That's some egg you just laid there, pal. You mind picking it back up?
GID00024569	You can't just toss those around when you feel like it!
GID00024570	I see what you're doing.
GID00024571	Analyzing. This behavior is not on file.
GID00024572	This behavior is not on file.
GID00024573	I hope you know what you're doing.
GID00024574	Whoa now. Be careful with that thing.
GID00024575	Out of the way!
GID00024576	Hot potato!
GID00024577	Scoot!
GID00024578	Hop to it!
GID00024579	Watch out!
GID00024580	Scatter!
GID00024581	Get down!

GID00024590	You really know how to throw those things!
GID00024591	I wish I could throw myself on a grenade!
GID00024592	Look out!

GID00024643	Thank you for your advice. You've helped me see more clearly.
GID00024644	Flails of God!
GID00024645	Who are you? How did you find this place?
GID00024646	Back again. What now?
GID00024647	Welcome to Novac. It's not very exciting here, but the people are friendly enough.
GID00024648	You saw the rockets explode, right? It turns out I was lucky they couldn't take me on the Great Journey.
GID00024649	Do you have any idea what went wrong?
GID00024650	I'm going to make my way to that little town we talked about.
GID00024651	Welcome to Novac. It's not very exciting here, but the people are friendly enough.
GID00024652	My engineering skills have been coming in handy, too. I've got plenty to do. Thanks for telling me about this place.
GID00024653	Hey! Over here! Are you listening?
GID00024654	Go to the big room on the east side of this building and take the metal staircase all the way up. And hurry.
GID00024655	All right, Smoothskin, I'm letting you in. You better watch yourself. I'll sure as hell be watching you.
GID00024656	What's the problem, smoothskin? Lost your way?
GID00024657	Hello? Who's down there?
GID00024658	Stop messing around with the intercom, smoothskin.
GID00024659	God, but are you ugly! Get upstairs and talk to Jason before I throw up just from looking at you.
GID00024660	Go bother Jason, smoothskin. I don't like having you around.
GID00024661	Have you found the components we discussed?
GID00024662	Have you found the components we discussed?
GID00024663	Have you found the components we discussed? The sooner we get this over with, the better.
GID00024664	Jason says that I am to cooperate with you on the final tasks necessary to launch the Great Journey.
GID00024665	Are you ready to get started? Those rockets aren't going to launch themselves.
GID00024666	It is almost time for the great Journey!
GID00024667	Not now! It is almost time for the Great Journey!
GID00024668	It is almost time for the great Journey!
GID00024669	Nice enough speech, I guess.
GID00024670	Well, it's up to you to go launch the rockets. There's a small mission control room all the way back upstairs. Should be as easy as pressin a button.
GID00024671	It seems my work here is done, so I'll be on my way to Novac. We'll see how that works out.
GID00024672	Did you hear him? As though some fancy speech can make what they did to me less of a crime?
GID00024673	Go launch the rockets! There's a cramped little "mission control" room all the way back upstairs. Should be as easy as pushing a button.
GID00024674	Enjoy the view. I hear the "Great Journey" is going to be shorter than they expected. Sweeter, too.
GID00024675	Did you hear him? My god, you were right all along. I'm no ghoul! They were just using me...
GID00024676	Go launch the rockets. Don't worry about me.
GID00024677	Leave me alone.
GID00024678	Did you bring the items we discussed? The sooner I send them on their way, the sooner I can head to Novac.
GID00024679	I'd remember if I had seen you here before, I'm sure of it... What do you want?
GID00024680	Welcome back, stranger.
GID00024682	Greetings, Hunter of The Thorn.
GID00024683	The crowds are waiting for you, stranger. Show us your best.
GID00024684	It's time for blood, not talk. Find me after the fight.
GID00024685	Well done, stranger. Here's your share.
GID00024686	The Thorn does not welcome you, stranger. Leave now or suffer the consequences.
GID00024687	Even the strongest creatures need their rest, and their companionship. I've been looking forward to this.
GID00024688	You know where we meet, and that's not here.
GID00024690	You've broken the rules of The Thorn. You've dishonored this sacred ground! I don't tolerate such offenses.
GID00024691	I admire your bravery, but coming down here after what you've done is just foolish. So be it, Legion dog!
GID00024692	We're watching you... stranger!
GID00024693	Don't fuck with the caged beasts.
GID00024694	I can't believe this shit. Time to die, punk!
GID00024695	Follow the rules of The Thorn.
GID00024696	Don't feed the creatures.
GID00024697	What did I tell you about breaking the rules? You're gonna learn the hard way, now.
GID00024698	Nowhere else will you find something like The Thorn.
GID00024699	Take advice. Don't break the rules. And we won't kill you.
GID00024700	You dared go against The Thorn, and now you'll pay for that!
GID00024701	Come see the fights, or Red Lucy?
GID00024702	Enjoy the show, and don't give us a reason to shoot you, okay?
GID00024703	You've just fucked up, big time!
GID00024704	Lay down with me, my hunter.
GID00024705	Our time was sweet, my hunter. But our passion will have to wait - The Thorn demands attention.
GID00024706	No more fights today. The Thorn needs time to soak its tribute of blood.
GID00024707	Welcome to REPCONN Headquarters, Rocketeer! Come all this way to see our little facility, have you?
GID00024708	I'm here to answer any and all questions you may have - within specified parameters - and if you'd like, I can provide a tour of our museum.
GID00024709	Welcome back! Interested in a tour of the REPCONN museum? Or did you have a question about the company I could answer?
GID00024710	Yes? Did you have a question?
GID00024711	Well howdy, pardner! Good to see ya again. Boss is waiting for ya upstairs, so get a move on!
GID00024712	Howdy, pardner! Doesn't look like you've brought back the Platinum Chip!
GID00024713	Why don't you mosey on back to wherever it is you left Benny cooling off? Come back when you got it.
GID00024714	Sorry, pardner, but the boss ain't available to take a meeting!
GID00024715	Howdy, pardner! Good to see you again!
GID00024716	Congratulations, pardner! The boss has instructed me to comp you to the High-Roller Suite!
GID00024717	You can bring your friends, too! Be like a little clubhouse for the gang you put together!
GID00024718	Just bear in mind, you're the only one gets to see the boss! Any friends you got, they can wait in the suite.
GID00024719	Enjoy the digs, pardner! They're plenty fancy!
GID00024720	What floor, pardner?
GID00024721	Where to, pardner?
GID00024722	Which floor, now?
GID00024723	Penthouse floor!
GID00024724	Cocktail lounge!
GID00024725	High-roller suite!
GID00024726	Casino floor!
GID00024727	B2! Physical Plant!
GID00024728	B2! Facilities Management!
GID00024729	Sorry, pardner, if you're heading for the penthouse, you gotta go alone.
GID00024730	You low-down snake! I wish I'd have left you in the ground to rot!
GID00024731	Draw!
GID00024732	Hey hey, fella, welcome to the Tops Hotel and Casino! I'm going to have to ask you to hand over any weapons you might be carrying.
GID00024733	Hey hey, baby doll, welcome to the Tops Hotel and Casino! I'm going to have to ask you to hand over any weapons you might be carrying.
GID00024734	Welcome back to the Tops. Anything I can do for you?
GID00024735	Enjoying your stay?
GID00024736	Get you a drink?
GID00024737	You're back. Any progress on saving our skins?
GID00024738	You're some kind of hero, huh? I heard about how you saved the President's life. That's incredible.
GID00024739	You've heard the news about President Kimball? Thank God he survived, but I hope the Rangers hunt down the miserable traitor that tried to kill him.
GID00024740	I just can't believe it... the President's dead. It doesn't even feel real.
GID00024741	You've heard the news about President Kimball? If I got my hands on the traitor that killed him....
GID00024742	So now it's come to open assassination attempts against the President? Hard to believe.
GID00024743	Thank God. Please tell me you're here to relieve me.
GID00024744	Never expected someone as famous as you to turn up here. What can I do for you?
GID00024745	I've been sending requests for relief for months now. Didn't think they'd send you, though.
GID00024746	I really hope you're not here to cause trouble.
GID00024747	Oh. I've heard of you. What do you want?
GID00024748	I'll give you this, you've got a lot of guts just walking in here like this.
GID00024749	What do you want?
GID00024750	If this isn't a crisis situation, you'd better have a damn good reason for interrupting me.
GID00024751	Anything else I can do for you?
GID00024752	What now?
GID00024753	What?
GID00024754	You've been a huge help here. Thanks to you, I think we can hold this camp together.
GID00024755	Was there something else?
GID00024756	It was you that rescued President Kimball, wasn't it? You're becoming quite the celebrity already.
GID00024757	I heard it was a close call for the President. Good thing he has top-notch security.
GID00024758	I hear they're already assembling a team to investigate the President's assassination. Going to be one hell of a report.
GID00024759	I'm a little ashamed to admit it, but a part of me would really love to get my hands on the bastard that killed the President.
GID00024760	I'm a little ashamed to admit it, but a part of me would really love to get my hands on the bitch that killed the President.
GID00024761	So, the NCR finally sent some relief? It's about damn time.
GID00024762	Wow. Hey, it's you. What are you doing in Bitter Springs?
GID00024763	I don't suppose you're feeling helpful today?
GID00024764	I don't know what you're doing here, but you can just leave. We've got enough problems here.
GID00024765	Those medical supplies have already been a phenomenal help. Thank you.
GID00024766	I really appreciate those books. They've already been a huge help.
GID00024767	Yeah? What is it?
GID00024768	Let me see what you got. Yeah, these'll do just fine. Just fine.
GID00024769	All right now. We're gonna be making something folks on the trail call Healing Powder.
GID00024770	Go on over to that campfire now. Give it a try.
GID00024771	Hey, hey! Look who has the hot hands? Here, have something special on the house.
GID00024772	Looks like someone is on a roll. Luck be a lady tonight. Here's a little something from the Family.
GID00024773	You keep on spending money in here. You gotta give us a chance to win something back. Here's something nice for you.
GID00024774	Ok, that's that. No more games for you. Go rob the Tops. You're done here.
GID00024775	Have some drinks, talk to some dancers but you are done at my tables.
GID00024776	We can chat later. The sooner you finish these tests the sooner you can get out of here.
GID00024777	It's important that you're relaxed for this next test. Please, have a seat.
GID00024778	All right. I'm gonna say a word. I want you to say the first thing that comes to mind.
GID00024779	Dog.
GID00024780	Here. These are yours. Was all you had on you when you was brought in.
GID00024781	I hope you don't mind but I gave the note a look. I thought it might help me find a next of kin. But it was just something about a platinum chip.
GID00024782	I've gotta hand it to you. You've done good things for Novac, but you've also got 'em a little scared of you. And that's great for business.
GID00024783	As long as you keep it coming, I'll get you some things a little cheaper than they should be.
GID00024784	What can I do for you?
GID00024785	Between you and me, I don't think she studied at an accredited institution.
GID00024786	She hasn't paid me anything yet. Should I be worried?
GID00024787	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00024788	<Makes beeping sounds>
GID00024789	Alright, that should do it. You need anything else?
GID00024790	And we're all done. That wasn't so bad, was it? Did you need anything else?
GID00024791	Feel better? You should, that was the good stuff. Need anything else?
GID00024792	See, that wasn't so bad. Anything else I can do for you?
GID00024793	You're all set. Are we done here?
GID00024794	You've helped me so much, it seems wrong to ask, but can you spare any more water?
GID00024795	I'll never forget you. Thank you for your help.
GID00024796	I hate to ask but... do you have any more water?
GID00024797	You've saved my life. Thank you, stranger. I hate to ask you this, but times are hard...
GID00024798	Can you spare any more water?
GID00024799	Just leave me to die in peace.
GID00024800	Just go away. I'd like to die without you standing over me gloating.
GID00024801	Oh, thank God. Someone new! I need water! Please! Water!
GID00024802	Can you help me? I need water... purified water... please...
GID00024803	Please... do you have any water? I'm so thirsty...
GID00024804	Please! Please help me... I need water! I'm dying!
GID00024805	A pleasure to meet you! I'm Dr. Thomas Hildern, Director of Operations, OSI East. I presume you're here about Vault 22?
GID00024806	We spoke earlier, didn't we? About Vault 22. My offer still stands, if you've changed your mind.
GID00024807	We still need a contractor on our Vault 22 project. Interested?
GID00024808	Yes? Something else you needed?
GID00024809	I received a pleasant call from Dr. Keely. It seems we have you to thank for keeping her alive. Very charitable of you.
GID00024810	Ah! I was just wondering what had become of you.
GID00024811	What do you want? I thought I told you to stay the hell out of here.
GID00024812	What are you doing in my office? You're not welcome here, get out!
GID00024813	Did Dr. Hildern... this really isn't any of my business, but... did he give you a job?
GID00024814	Little busy at the moment. But I can talk.
GID00024815	If you can find Keely and keep her safe, I'll pay you what I can. I gave my word, and I meant it.
GID00024816	Keely just called in. You should have heard the Director. "But I-" "Wait a-" "Now look here-"
GID00024817	She wouldn't let him finish a sentence. Just reamed him out for sending all those people to the Vault. I've never seen his face so red and twitchy.
GID00024818	Thanks for keeping her safe. Here's the caps I promised. I knew I had a good feeling about you.
GID00024819	Did you find Keely? You haven't been back for a while, so I was hoping...
GID00024820	Oh! Good to see you again.
GID00024821	Unless I hear from Keely, we've got nothing to talk about.
GID00024822	Keely still hasn't checked in. It's not like her...
GID00024823	After what happened with Keely, Hildern's got his eye on me. We shouldn't be talking... not anymore.
GID00024824	You're new? I'm Angela. Williams. Were you just looking around, or...
GID00024825	Took your sweet time. I suppose the NCR sent you?
GID00024826	Not now! I've got to get up to the lab and finish what I started!
GID00024827	This Vault-Tech machinery is so fragile. I had to jury-rig this elevator a few days ago and it's on the fritz again already.
GID00024828	Ah, that's got it. See you upstairs.
GID00024829	Hm, what's this? Did you do these repairs? Not bad. Not bad at all.
GID00024830	Saves me time, I guess. See you upstairs.
GID00024831	Good, you're here. Ready to begin?
GID00024832	I suppose you have questions. Hurry up and ask them.
GID00024833	Ah, good. You survived. I was beginning to think you hadn't. You'll be pleased to know that the spores should no longer be a problem.
GID00024834	Now all that's left is to ensure that none of this ever happens again. The research that led to these abominations must be erased.
GID00024835	Don't mind me. I have to wrap things up here, gather my gear, that sort of thing. I'll be leaving soon enough.
GID00024836	Greetings! I do not believe we have met before. I have the singular distinction of being designated as Bohr.
GID00024837	Calculating...
GID00024838	Well, that's a start. But I don't reckon you came to me to learn to fight sarsaparilla bottles.
GID00024839	Tell you what. I gotta go chase geckos away from our water supply anyway. Darn critters are attracted to it. Why don't you come along?
GID00024840	Hear that up on the ridge behind me there? We got some geckos to clear out.
GID00024841	Bunch of little monsters is what they are. Seems like Doc Mitchell treats more gecko bites than anything else.
GID00024842	Let's see if we can get a little closer. If we move quietly, we can get the jump on 'em. More likely to hit something vital that way.
GID00024843	See? You're getting the hang of it.
GID00024844	There's two more wells that still need clearing. You want, you can come along. It'd be worth a few caps to me.
GID00024845	Confound it, Cheyenne, why'd you have to go running in like that? You were supposed to stay.
GID00024846	I'm sorry, you shouldn't have to see me like this. I'm not not gonna be very good company right now.
GID00024847	I did have another thing to teach, but I'll understand if you'd rather I just pay you so you can be on your way.
GID00024848	Now that was some good work. Even got a little exciting there at the end.
GID00024849	Here's a little spending money for the trouble.
GID00024850	Ah, hell's bells. There's not a day passes by I don't tell people not to come here by themselves.
GID00024851	Some people, your word just isn't good enough for them. Then this happens.
GID00024852	Well, it's part of life out here. Best to accept it.
GID00024853	But you did what you promised, staying out here with me. Here's my end of the deal.
GID00024854	Hey, that's not bad! See? All it takes to make a recipe is the right ingredients and the right know-how.
GID00024855	Sometimes it won't be a campfire you need. Might need to do some work on your guns and ammo, maybe.
GID00024856	Important thing to get is it's all the same idea. You just need to find the right place to set up shop. Workbench or... a reloading bench, whatever.
GID00024857	Well, I hope that's enough to get you started.
GID00024858	Everything all right?
GID00024859	I'm heading back now. Hope I didn't miss anything good on the jukebox. Cheyenne would never forgive me.
GID00024860	The cleaners will knock twice. Make sure they're thorough.
GID00024861	Baby, this little reunion of ours? Chalk me up as a no-show.
GID00024862	I'm surprised you fell for it, not that I'm complaining. You caused plenty enough trouble, turning Swank against me.
GID00024863	You've forced my hand. Hell, I gotta skip town because of you. A real pain in the caboose...
GID00024864	Baby, this little meet and greet of ours? Chalk me up as a no-show.
GID00024865	It would be 41 flavors of stupid to let you get a drop on me. And you've caused plenty enough trouble as-is.
GID00024866	You've forced my hand. Hell, I gotta skip town because of you. A real pain in the caboose...
GID00024867	What in the goddamn...?
GID00024868	Let's keep this in the groove, hey? Smooth moves, like smooth little babies...
GID00024869	What in the goddamn...?
GID00024870	Let's keep this in the groove, hey? Smooth moves. Smooth...
GID00024871	Hello! The guy everyone saw go in the Lucky 38, that was you? Oh shit.
GID00024872	What in the goddamn...?
GID00024873	Let's keep this in the groove, hey? Smooth moves. Smooth...
GID00024874	Hello! That broad everyone saw go in the Lucky 38, that was you? Shit.
GID00024875	What in the goddamn...?
GID00024876	Let's keep this in the groove, hey? Smooth moves. Smooth...
GID00024877	Hello! It was you, smashed up the Omertas? You did that? Shit.
GID00024878	What in the goddamn...?
GID00024879	Let's keep this in the groove, hey? Smooth moves. Smooth...
GID00024880	Hello! It was you, wiped out the Khans down in Boulder City? You did that? Oh shit.
GID00024881	What in the goddamn...?
GID00024882	Let's keep this in the groove, hey? Smooth moves. Smooth...
GID00024883	Hello! It was you, set the Khans free down in Boulder City? You did that? Oh shit.
GID00024884	What in the goddamn...?
GID00024885	Let's keep this in the groove, hey? Smooth moves. Smooth...
GID00024886	Hello! The gasser everyone's been talking about, making a splash on the Strip. That's been you? Oh shit.
GID00024887	Benny is gonna show you the Tops! I hope you're built sturdy, you crazy broad!
GID00024888	What in the goddamn...?
GID00024889	You? How could you be...? Oh Swank, you finky bastard...
GID00024890	You got a crazy drop on me, baby, but you don't want to kill me. We should be working together.
GID00024891	Hey hey hey, what the hell...?
GID00024892	Oh Swank, you finky bastard...
GID00024893	You got a crazy drop on me, baby, but you don't want to kill me. It's like I said, we should be working together.
GID00024894	I comped you the prez so we can talk there, hey? No need to keep tugging at my sleeve.
GID00024895	Wait until we get to the Presidential, pally. I don't need you tugging at my sleeve.
GID00024896	Cool by me if you wanna talk after all... but a confab like this, out in public, in my place of business? That don't play.
GID00024897	What say you and me cash out, go somewheres more private-like? Any questions you got, I'll answer.
GID00024898	Like I said, we should be talking somewheres private.
GID00024899	Now that you and me's got some privacy, I gotta ask - how is it that you're still living?
GID00024900	Once you were vertical, how'd you track me down?
GID00024901	I guess that's enough scratching around at first base. Tell me, which way is the wind gonna blow?
GID00024902	You got questions, I got answers.
GID00024903	How else can I clue you in?
GID00024904	Something else you wanted to know?
GID00024905	It's the House edge, baby - literally. It's what Mr. House needs to stack the odds in his favor.
GID00024906	What about it?
GID00024907	Yeah, it's a tricky world out there. I'll tell it to you straight.
GID00024908	What else did you want to know?
GID00024909	Broad strokes? Change in management.
GID00024910	The Securitrons are where it's at. I need a way to control them, and a way to beef up their hitting power.
GID00024911	I get those two ducks in a row, Vegas can defend itself versus all comers - NCR, Caesar's Legion, it won't matter.
GID00024912	What else did you want to know?
GID00024913	Like I said, once the Chairmen are running Vegas, you'll get a percentage. Until then I'll pay you a retainer and bonuses for "special missions."
GID00024914	What are you, crazy? These Praetorians mean business!
GID00024915	You're a scrapper, baby. They didn't stand a chance. How about me?
GID00024916	Change in plans?
GID00024917	Pussycat! Ain't this platinum? Had I known, I woulda baked a cake!
GID00024918	That last turn we took is an 18 karat memory, baby. It's all that's been keeping me warm at night, stuck where I am.
GID00024919	Why you little promise-breaker! "Let me live, Benny, and I'll never come after you - pinky swear!" What a fink! Anyway...
GID00024920	Go ahead and laugh, baby. I ain't blind to the humor in this situation.
GID00024921	Sing, baby. You got a captive audience.
GID00024922	Go on.
GID00024923	Down to brass tacks. How'd your meet and greet with Baldie go?
GID00024924	Try not to smile so wide, baby. You might break your mouth.
GID00024925	Yeah, Baldie said you'd get to decide. So which way you leaning?
GID00024926	Last we spoke, you were leaning in more merciful direction...?
GID00024927	So you keep saying.
GID00024928	So baby, what did you find down there?
GID00024929	I see. And how's that gonna happen?
GID00024930	What's holding you up? Let's get this over with.
GID00024931	Which greedy overlord do you want to start with?
GID00024932	I'm the most interesting person I know.
GID00024933	I never tire of talking about myself.
GID00024934	I'm still a little choked up over here, baby. We'll catch up in a bit.
GID00024935	Scram, will ya? I value my privacy.
GID00024936	You and me gonna accomplish great things, baby.
GID00024937	Name a name.
GID00024938	You're the courier who's caused so much trouble for my Legion, and yet you dare come before me.
GID00024939	<INERT NODE TO HOLD LINES FOR HOW PLAYER HAS TROUBLED LEGION.>
GID00024940	So I finally get to meet the courier who's caused so much trouble for the New California Republic.
GID00024941	<INERT NODE TO HOLD LINES FOR HOW PLAYER HAS TROUBLED NCR.>
GID00024942	So I finally get to meet the courier who's accomplished so much in so little time. That is why I summoned you here, right?
GID00024943	I mean, a man nearly kills you, and your response is to track him across the breadth of the Mojave?
GID00024944	The question is... are you ready to get started?
GID00024945	Down the hill, at the west edge of camp, is an old building. It was here when the Fort was taken in 2277.
GID00024946	Inside the building is a hatch, and inside that hatch are two steel doors that bear the sigil of the Lucky 38 casino.
GID00024947	Now that same sigil is on the Platinum Chip Benny was carrying when we captured him. Isn't that interesting?
GID00024948	Now that same sigil is on the Platinum Chip you were carrying. Isn't that interesting?
GID00024949	Even more interesting, there's a slot about the same size as the Chip on the console that opens the hatch. So you know what I think?
GID00024950	I think the Platinum Chip opens those doors - doors that can't be pried open or drilled open or blasted open. Because all that, I tried.
GID00024951	We'll talk again when you've destroyed whatever is down in that bunker - not before.
GID00024952	I felt the ground shake a while ago. I'll take that as a sign you got the job done.
GID00024953	There are rewards for doing as I command. Today, your reward is vengeance. You get to decide how Benny dies.
GID00024954	Go to Benny, let him know what you've decided. My Praetorians will perform the execution - unless you want to perform it yourself.
GID00024955	We have nothing to discuss until you've dealt with Benny.
GID00024956	I'm sure you found Benny's demise pleasing. The destruction of an enemy... there are few things more satisfying.
GID00024957	Let's press on, shall we? As I was telling you before, I want Mr. House out of the picture.
GID00024958	You have an interest in his death, too. If he knows that you destroyed his gadgets beneath the Fort, he will strike back.
GID00024959	You know where to find him. How he dies, I leave up to you.
GID00024960	Until Mr. House has been dealt with, you and I have nothing to talk about.
GID00024961	I've read Mr. House's obituary. Had a high opinion of himself, didn't he?
GID00024962	I spent months feeding the Omertas bribes, nursing their betrayal, and you've ruined all that.
GID00024963	Do you have any idea how much effort it took to place a mole at McCarran who could plant that bomb on the monorail? The one you defused?
GID00024964	The garrison I placed at Nelson served a vital strategic function. Did you think you could wipe it out and I wouldn't find out?
GID00024965	Weeks were spent convincing the Great Khans to join the Legion, but you've ruined all that. Haven't you?
GID00024966	With Mr. House out of the way, I can focus on smoothing out a few lingering complications elsewhere in the Mojave.
GID00024967	First up are the Boomers of Nellis Air Force Base, a tribe so reclusive, it lobs artillery shells at anyone who comes near their settlement.
GID00024968	I want you to offer them an alliance with my Legion. My terms are simple: target their guns against the NCR side of the dam when I assault it...
GID00024969	...and they can keep their freedom. If you find they aren't amenable to this offer, destroy them.
GID00024970	It's reached me that you killed Silus before he could talk. I approve.
GID00024971	I understand that you freed Silus before he could talk. I approve.
GID00024972	Silus dishonored himself when he let himself be captured, and he'll pay the price for that. But the NCR didn't learn anything valuable.
GID00024973	Have you brought news of the Boomers?
GID00024974	I would've asked you to forge an alliance with the White Glove Society, but you've already killed its leaders. So instead -
GID00024975	Ehhhh! Goddammit!
GID00024976	I want you to forge an alliance between Caesar's Legion and the White Glove Society.
GID00024977	They used to be cannibals. I expect that information can be used to manipulate them. Go to -
GID00024978	Ehhhh! Goddammit!
GID00024979	Goddammit, go away! Come back when I've had some sleep!
GID00024980	I warned you not to bother me!
GID00024981	Praetorians, kill this asshole!
GID00024982	The last time we met, I believe we were talking about the White Glove Society?
GID00024983	Have you been successful in your efforts to recruit the White Glove Society?
GID00024984	I want you to destroy the Mojave Chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel. It's not a full-strength chapter, mind you. The Profligates...
GID00024986	Urh...
GID00024987	If you interfere with me getting some sleep again, I'm going to have you killed. We will talk later.
GID00024988	You want to die? Fine!
GID00024989	Praetorians! Kill this asshole!
GID00024990	Has the Brotherhood been destroyed?
GID00024991	I want you to join me in my tent. You and I are going to have a private conversation.
GID00024992	All right, let's state the obvious. There's something wrong with me.
GID00024993	The headaches started a couple months ago. They weren't too bad at first... but now they come frequently and they're... debilitating.
GID00024994	For the past two weeks, my left leg has been dragging. It's stiffer, hard to move. And you've seen me blank out.
GID00024995	Lucius says I stare into space, blink a few times, then keep talking like nothing happened. So what's the diagnosis?
GID00024996	I thank you for saving my life. You're a warrior and a healer - a rare combination.
GID00024997	I thank you for saving my life. Arcade will be a fine addition to my retinue.
GID00024998	I thank you for saving my life. The Auto-Doc module you recovered did the trick.
GID00024999	I trust this payment is adequate compensation for your troubles. Now, lest we grow sentimental here...
GID00025000	The time for battle will soon be upon us. Legatus Lanius draws nigh. When he arrives, my Legion will assault Hoover Dam.
GID00025001	In the meantime, the Profligates have prepared a welcome gift for us. The President of the NCR intends to visit Hoover Dam.
GID00025002	You dispatched President Kimball with real skill. Right under their noses, too - what a humiliation.
GID00025003	Why did you not attack President Kimball?
GID00025004	President Kimball was there on the Dam, right before you. And yet he lives. How did you fuck this up?
GID00025005	My forces are in position to assault the Dam. Legatus Lanius has assumed command.
GID00025006	Are you ready to go to him? To tell him to begin the assault?
GID00025007	You know everything you need to know. Be on your way.
GID00025008	What did you want to know?
GID00025009	What else did you want to know?
GID00025010	Even with the Boomers to deal with, you have questions?
GID00025011	Even with the White Glove Society to deal with, you have questions?
GID00025012	Even with the Brotherhood to deal with, you have questions?
GID00025013	Even with a President to kill, you have questions?
GID00025014	Even on the brink of the final battle, you have questions?
GID00025015	Do you have any progress to report?
GID00025016	Allow me to make this clear. Because you've been of service to me, I will forgive your crimes against my Legion this one time.
GID00025017	In the future, if I become aware that you've committed other crimes, I'll have my Praetorians butcher you before my eyes.
GID00025018	If you've committed any other crimes, this is the time to confess them, because after today there will be no forgiveness.
GID00025019	I warned you about this. Praetorians, slaughter this degenerate!
GID00025020	I can't believe it. Caesar's Legion attacks in force, and I actually survived!
GID00025021	Unngh... why do I feel so terrible?
GID00025022	I'm glad those nighttime raids have stopped. I was getting worried.
GID00025023	Doc seems to be doing all right patching people up, at least.
GID00025024	I never thought they'd actually send us reinforcements.
GID00025025	Welcome to Bitter Springs. Quite a sight, isn't it?
GID00025026	I hear there's a ghost in these mountains... and it doesn't like the NCR much.
GID00025027	Not enough food, not enough medicine, and definitely not enough sleep.
GID00025028	I don't know how we're expected to hold this place with so few men.
GID00025029	All these refugees... is Caesar's Legion really that big?
GID00025030	This is the worst detail in the Mojave.
GID00025031	Can't believe the Legion hit us in such numbers. They're stronger than we think.
GID00025032	I coughed up blood this morning. I think I'm really sick.
GID00025033	No attacks for a while now. That's a good sign, right?
GID00025034	I think there's something wrong with the food.
GID00025035	I swear I saw somebody sneaking out of the graveyard the other night.
GID00025036	Lieutenant Markland always looks like he's afraid the kids are gonna bite him.
GID00025037	Markland seems to be getting better with his bedside manner.
GID00025038	Finally got enough pills to chase off that damn infection.
GID00025039	Doc's gotten real handy with the kids these days.
GID00025040	Hope the Doc can give me some meds this week.
GID00025041	Nice to see more guards on patrol. Maybe Caesar won't murder us all.
GID00025042	Finally starting to get some decent food around here.
GID00025043	Not enough soldiers here to stop Caesar if he rolls through.
GID00025044	So tired....
GID00025045	Haven't had a decent meal in weeks.
GID00025046	Legion just came out of nowhere.
GID00025047	The man with the spiky hat comes into camp at night!
GID00025048	Did you know ants can get *this big?*
GID00025049	I saw snake puppies in the hills!
GID00025050	I say, would you like some of this absolutely delightful confection I found? I've been grazing on it all day!
GID00025051	I like you! Will you take Barnabas Bear to New Vegas when you go?
GID00025052	I'm hungry!
GID00025053	I'm sleepy!
GID00025054	I'm scared!
GID00025055	My tummy hurts!
GID00025056	Where's my mommy?
GID00025057	Ah, the outsider who gained our master's favor. You prove yourself as cunning as the rumors report.
GID00025058	I cannot speak long, for my men need direction. What do you want?
GID00025059	The legate is expecting you.
GID00025060	It is important that you go see the legate.
GID00025061	The legate would have my head if I were to let you pass.
GID00025062	Soon, my lovelies. Soon you'll get all the meat you can handle.
GID00025063	I haven't fed them in days. The legate wants them hungry for the battle to come.
GID00025064	Some fool asked me the other day what mongrel meat tastes like. I told him I'd sooner feed him to my dogs than the other way around.
GID00025065	The enemy is weak up close, so I must learn to kill quickly at that quarter.
GID00025066	When attacking with a blade, aim for the meat of the opponent. Tendons and muscle are no good to a man when severed.
GID00025067	When attacking with a blunt weapon, aim for the opponent's bones. Hips, joints, and especially the skull are all viable targets.
GID00025068	A sharp knife can make the difference between a clean kill and a messy death.
GID00025069	It's amazing how dull a blade can get just by passing through slave meat.
GID00025070	I must have all of these blades sharpened soon. Rumor is we head out any time now.
GID00025071	Our men are stronger, faster, and have wills of iron. How can we lose?
GID00025072	I'm a little busy at the moment.
GID00025073	When will we receive the order to march? I'll go crazy if I don't kill something soon.
GID00025074	We will see that the camp is protected from NCR assassins.
GID00025075	The battle is already decided. All that's left is the bloodletting.
GID00025076	Mars be with you.
GID00025077	Salve, Courier. How goes the battle in the east?
GID00025078	My orders are to remain here, and direct our men as they arrive. Go!
GID00025079	Since you haven't pissed yourself I'll assume that you don't know who we are - next time I'll bring my sickle and wear my black cloak.
GID00025080	See, the NCR sends us when they want terrible things done to terrible people...
GID00025081	Sorry, friend, you crossed the NCR one too many times - you've been marked for death... and we're here to take care of that.
GID00025082	Nothing personal - orders - you know how it is. Well, let's get to it.
GID00025083	Never mind - don't care. You've got two more days to deal with your bad NCR reputation.
GID00025084	Make them happy or we'll make you dead.
GID00025085	We're back - you've got two days left to improve your NCR reputation. After that we find you and end you. Clear?
GID00025086	Remember us? You've got two days left make up for pissing off the NCR. See you around. <laughs>
GID00025087	So, last day on earth, huh? Getting your affairs in order? Or are you still trying to work on that bad reputation of yours?
GID00025088	The NCR just wants to be friends, but you don't seem to want to play nice. See you tomorrow.
GID00025089	Tick-tock, time's up. The NCR says you gotta die, so guess what?
GID00025090	I gave you three days - you should have crawled in a hole somewhere. Time to die.
GID00025091	Well, take a good look around - this is where your life ended.
GID00025092	Well, seems like you've redeemed yourself. Welcome back to the NCR's good graces. Play nice... or I'll be back for you.
GID00025093	The brass has put me back on my leash - that must mean that you've decided to play nice with the NCR. Good choice, you just saved your life.
GID00025094	Don't make me come after you again.
GID00025095	I see you took my advice and made nice with the NCR. Guess that means you aren't as dumb as you look.
GID00025096	Stay smart and I won't have to come for you again.
GID00025097	I don't know how you managed to improve your reputation with the NCR after pissing us off like that, but honestly...
GID00025098	I'm just happy I don't have to kill you now. See you around, wastelander.
GID00025099	Get him! Nobody screws with the NCR!
GID00025100	The NCR's come for you - time to die!
GID00025101	You crossed the NCR one time too many - now you die!
GID00025102	Did you think you'd get away with crossing the NCR?!
GID00025103	The NCR wants you dead, friend!
GID00025104	Consider this your final warning from the NCR!
GID00025105	Nobody crosses the NCR!
GID00025106	You'll pay for crossing the NCR!
GID00025107	This is what the NCR does with traitors!
GID00025108	This is not a market, sir - you need to improve your reputation with the NCR before you're welcome in our outposts.
GID00025109	You're walking on thin ice with the NCR. It's time to decide where your loyalties lay, friend. Until then don't expect any hospitality from us.
GID00025110	The NCR isn't in the habit of letting loose cannons like you just wander our bases.
GID00025111	I suggest you move along until you decide where your loyalties fall.
GID00025112	Get up! You can't sleep here - move on.
GID00025113	Wake up, merc! These cots are for NCR only.
GID00025114	No room at the inn, merc. Move along.
GID00025115	Slumber party's over, pal. Get a move-on.
GID00025116	Wake-y wake-y - eggs and bake-y. <laughs>
GID00025117	Wake up! This ain't your bed.
GID00025118	Get up.
GID00025119	Move along.
GID00025120	Get up. Sleep it off somewhere else.
GID00025121	Get out of that bed.
GID00025122	No sleeping here.
GID00025123	You've done a good turn for the NCR and now we'd like to do one for you - here's an NCR emergency two-way radio - you call and we'll come running.
GID00025124	You're not alone out here - the NCR has your back. Stay safe and good hunting.
GID00025125	The NCR takes care of its own - so in thanks for your service to the Republic... here's one of our emergency two-way radios.
GID00025126	You call and we'll come running. If you're too far from an NCR outpost there won't be much we can do for you...
GID00025127	but then the NCR is just about everywhere these days. Good luck and stay safe out there.
GID00025128	For your service, beyond the call of duty, the NCR would like to award you with this emergency two-way radio.
GID00025129	You call and we'll send you any support we can spare. Keep up the good work, soldier.
GID00025130	The NCR would like to thank you for your service. If you ever need us, just call and we'll come running.
GID00025131	The NCR takes care of its own... and its supporters. Stay safe out there and call us if you get in a jam.
GID00025132	Coordinates for supply cache in your region being sent... now.
GID00025133	Received - updating map marker for local NCR supply cache.
GID00025134	This is NCR Operator - message received - sending map marker for local supply cache.
GID00025135	This is NCR Operator - I read you. The supplies are on their way.
GID00025136	Message received - supplies en route.
GID00025137	Supply crate airdrop heading to your location.
GID00025138	NCR Trooper support en route to your location.
GID00025139	NCR support moving to your location.
GID00025140	Request received - NCR Troopers in your area are being redirected to your location.
GID00025141	NCR Ranger support en route to your location.
GID00025142	The cavalry is on its way - just sit tight, we'll be there.
GID00025143	Support inbound - deploying NCR Rangers to your location.
GID00025144	Your wish is my command - NCR support is on its way.
GID00025145	Your problems will soon be solved - Rangers heading your way now.
GID00025146	There is no NCR support in your area - suggest a tactical retreat.
GID00025147	Negative, no NCR support available at your current location.
GID00025148	Transmission not received - attempt new transmission closer to an NCR outpost.
GID00025149	Sorry, sir, that's all the support I can spare today.
GID00025150	I can't redirect any more support to you today - it would put too many lives at risk. I'll get you what I can tomorrow.
GID00025151	I can't afford to send you anything else today. Sorry, sir... good luck out there.
GID00025152	You're just going to have to cowboy up, sir - I can't spare any more support today.
GID00025153	I sent you all I had last time, sir - you're on your own until at least midnight.
GID00025154	I sent you all I had last time, sir - you're on your own until we get resupplied tomorrow.
GID00025155	Support request received - deploying Troopers to your area. Hold tight, help is on the way.
GID00025156	Received - find some cover, NCR support is on the way.
GID00025157	I sent you all I had last time, sir - you're on your own until dawn at least.
GID00025158	Stay safe out there.
GID00025159	Good hunting, sir.
GID00025160	Over.
GID00025161	Over-and-out.
GID00025162	Good luck out there.
GID00025163	NCR Trooper, reporting for duty!
GID00025164	Trooper, ready to fight!
GID00025165	You called for a Trooper?
GID00025166	You called for an extra gun?
GID00025167	I got your call and came running.
GID00025168	Guns and gear - at your service.
GID00025169	Someone said you needed backup? I'm it.
GID00025170	You called for backup?
GID00025171	Where's the fight, sir?
GID00025172	For the Republic!
GID00025173	Ranger at the ready!
GID00025174	NCR Ranger, reporting for duty!
GID00025175	Here we are, you just point and we'll shoot.
GID00025176	Here I am, just point at what needs killing.
GID00025177	One riot, one ranger... let's get this done.
GID00025178	Heard you were in a spot of trouble, friend. Let's fix that.
GID00025179	I heard your call and happened to be in the area.
GID00025180	For the Republic!
GID00025181	You called for an extra gun?
GID00025182	You're lucky I happened to be nearby.
GID00025183	I got your flank - you just shoot what's in front of you!
GID00025184	Ranger here - where's the fight?
GID00025185	What are you doing here? This is our casino, punk.
GID00025186	Gotta run! No time to chat!
GID00025187	Sorry, you just win too much. We can't let you play here anymore.
GID00025188	Welcome to Vikki and Vance, we're still getting the casino up and running but feel free to sit down and play.
GID00025189	We're hoping that Primm will get back on its feet from the money we earn here.
GID00025190	We feel much safer opening the casino back up, now that we have a sheriff.
GID00025191	I'm glad that I could start working here again, things were rough with those convicts in town.
GID00025192	The Caesar has marked you for death... and the Legion obeys. Ready yourself for battle.
GID00025193	Now you will serve as an example to all who dare oppose Caesar's Legion. Defend yourself!
GID00025194	You have defied Caesar for the last time! Your life ends now!
GID00025195	I've told you Powder Gangers everything I know! Please don't hit me anymore!
GID00025196	Well look at that! You aren't a Powder Ganger after all. I'd suggest against wearing that outfit around the townsfolk. You may get shot by accident.
GID00025197	I don't suppose you came here to rescue me?
GID00025198	I don't suppose you came here to rescue me? I'd cross my fingers but my hands are numb.
GID00025199	It would be so very delightful if you set me free.
GID00025200	Please excuse me - I'm extricating myself at the moment...
GID00025201	Apologies, but I'm quite busy until I reach safety!
GID00025202	Well! That was quite an adventure. We taught those convicts a thing or two, didn't we?
GID00025203	Breaking myself out of a hostage situation - not to diminish your role in it, of course - but it was quite thrilling.
GID00025204	Problem is, there's still no law in Primm. What're we to do the next time ruffians menace us and hold us hostage?
GID00025205	Well! That was quite a per-dicament you rescued me from, there in the Bison Steve. A most unpleasant experience.
GID00025206	Going in alone to rescue a hostage! My brother-in-law was brave like that. Made a fine sheriff. Until the Powder Gangers killed him.
GID00025207	Problem is, there's still no law in Primm. What're we to do the next time ruffians menace us and hold us hostage?
GID00025208	Well, if it isn't the "lawbringer."
GID00025209	Hello again. I don't suppose you've decided to help Primm find its next sheriff?
GID00025210	Any luck finding a suitable candidate for our next sheriff?
GID00025211	Oh, it's you.
GID00025212	I suppose I should be thanking you for restoring the rule of law to Primm...
GID00025213	I don't plan to come back to the Bison Steve much in the years to come. If I ever get out of it.
GID00025214	I do hope this ordeal will be over soon.
GID00025215	If we were to miss a convict or two in here, who'd know the difference?
GID00025216	I'm Lieutenant Hayes of the New California Republic Army, 5th Battalion, 1st Company. What's your business?
GID00025217	Yeah?
GID00025218	Primm is secure against outside threats. Be interesting to see how long the natives stay grateful.
GID00025219	I'm Sergeant McGee of the New California Republic Army, 5th Battalion, 1st Company. If you want to talk about something, speak to Lieutenant Hayes.
GID00025220	What is it?
GID00025221	Move along, waster. Got a town to run here.
GID00025222	Howdy pardner! Welcome to the Vikki and Vance Casino and Museum.
GID00025223	Howdy pardner! Any luck tracking down Vance's gun?
GID00025224	Always good to see you, pardner! Anything I can help you with?
GID00025225	What are you doing here, stranger? You looking to start some trouble?
GID00025226	This better be good, stranger.
GID00025227	You'd best not try any funny business, stranger. One word from me, and Vance will plant you in the ground!
GID00025228	What the hell you want?
GID00025229	Thanks for talking Pauline out of robbing the Strip. Who knows what she'll think of next?
GID00025230	Thank god you talked me out of trying to rob the Strip. I guess we'll wait here until I come up with our next caper.
GID00025231	I don't know what it was brought you to Primm, youngster, but you might want to rethink your plans. Town's gone to hell.
GID00025232	You got that old robot up and running again? How is it working out for you?
GID00025233	Hey, youngster. Still hanging about Primm, huh?
GID00025234	Heard it was you brought the law back to Primm, youngster. Hat's off to you.
GID00025235	Primm had rule of law for the blink of an eye, but now we're back where we started.
GID00025236	Hey there, youngster.
GID00025237	Hello there. What brings you to Primm?
GID00025238	Welcome back. Good to see you again.
GID00025239	It's better not to do a lot of talking on assassination missions.
GID00025240	I hear you took care of Motor-Runner. I could have handled that on my own.
GID00025241	Thanks for the help back at Vault 3. I couldn't have gotten out of there without the assist.
GID00025242	Thanks for the assistance, doc. Time for us to go take out Motor-Runner?
GID00025243	What do you need? I have a job to do.
GID00025244	I'm ready to take out Motor-Runner when you are.
GID00025245	How the hell did you get in here? And who the hell are you?
GID00025246	What are you doing here, soldier? I didn't call for any support.
GID00025247	Hey! Yeah you! Come give us a hand!
GID00025248	You again. You ready to give us some help?
GID00025249	Rick is dead, but I'd still welcome my freedom!
GID00025250	Are you going to free me or what?
GID00025251	Thanks for the help.
GID00025252	Thank you for releasing us.
GID00025253	Talk to Rick if you have something you'd like to say.
GID00025254	If you have anything to say, talk to Rick.
GID00025255	Why the fuck are you back here?
GID00025256	What the fuck are you doing here?
GID00025257	Man, are you turned around. Motor-Runner is one the other side of the complex.
GID00025258	Can I help you with something, stranger?
GID00025259	I hear tell you pretty well wiped out the Fiends around here. Not bad, not bad.
GID00025260	Welcome back, merc.
GID00025261	Have you taken care of those squatters?
GID00025262	Have you run off those greasers?
GID00025263	Good to see you around. Take care, merc.
GID00025264	You're still around, huh?
GID00025265	What do you want?
GID00025266	Piss off!
GID00025267	We're going, we're going!
GID00025268	What are you doing here? Get out before I blow your head off!
GID00025269	I can't believe this shit. You again?
GID00025270	So, what's up?
GID00025271	I hope you've got some good news about Alice.
GID00025272	I should kill you, right here, for what you've done.
GID00025273	Hello there! Welcome to the Crimson Caravan Company. How can I help you today?
GID00025274	Need anything?
GID00025275	I owe you an apology, stranger. We almost lost her forever, and I'm glad that things didn't turn out for the worse.
GID00025276	Oh. Hello, there.
GID00025277	I hope you're not planning on visiting the Strip.
GID00025278	The rest of this city has gone absolutely to seed!
GID00025279	Any news from out of town?
GID00025280	Don't recall seeing you here before.
GID00025281	Welcome to North Vegas, stranger!
GID00025282	Don't rush me. We're going, okay?
GID00025283	What the hell are you looking at, punk?
GID00025284	Rot in hell.
GID00025286	Back off! I know how to use this gun, and I'm not afraid to shoot if you try anything!
GID00025287	I've put up with their shit long enough. No more! I'll... I'll kill them if they get in my way!
GID00025288	What are you looking at, huh? Answer me, or I'll get trigger-happy real quick.
GID00025289	Humph... I see lots of folks come and go, but none fit your type. Where you come from, stranger?
GID00025290	Look, I'm willing to let you slide, but you're asking for it. Tell me what's your business in my town.
GID00025291	What's eating you?
GID00025293	You again? Get out here, smoothface.
GID00025294	Get lost!
GID00025295	I've got nothing to say to you, punk. Scram!
GID00025296	What the fuck you want, huh?
GID00025297	Hey, you! What the hell are you doing? Keep snooping around here and I'll skin you like a fucking Gecko.
GID00025298	Andy's not gonna be happy. Where the hell's that crazy bitch?
GID00025299	What?
GID00025300	... Huh?
GID00025301	I've got nothing to say to you, stranger.
GID00025302	I was blind to what was happening in my own family. We don't have much, but please take this.
GID00025303	What... what have I done!? Mother...
GID00025306	Look what you've done, you bastard!
GID00025307	Oh no! Alice... Alice, baby! I'm sorry, so sorry...
GID00025308	She... Alice left, didn't she? I can't believe you let her go! Some help you've been!
GID00025309	Good to see you again. I'm just passing through here; staying at this refugee camp, under the wing of NCR thugs, is the last thing on my mind.
GID00025310	Hey there! I'm on my way to Novac to find a new home, even if it lasts just a little while. See you around.
GID00025311	Hello again. Well, this is my place now. With time, I'll turn it into a good home.
GID00025312	This is my room, now you get the fuck out before you get yourself hurt.
GID00025313	I warned you, now it is time to eat hot fucking lead.
GID00025314	Get the fuck out of my room.
GID00025315	I thought I told you to get the fuck out of here.
GID00025316	Hey, thanks for all the hard work back there. I'm going to run a tight ship here, don't you worry.
GID00025317	It is time for the meeting with the bosses. We can't chit chat right now.
GID00025318	Hey, thanks for all the help back there.
GID00025319	Hey pal, thanks for helping us shape things up. You're good people.
GID00025320	Take a seat on the couch over there, Nero and me want to have a little talk with you.
GID00025321	Take a seat on the couch please, so we can have a little talking time.
GID00025322	I'm on my way to have some private time, give me some peace.
GID00025323	I'm on my way to my office, give me a little time before you get in my face.
GID00025324	I'm on my way to my room, I don't have time to chat with you right now.
GID00025325	Come to my office, we'll have a little chat with Cachino.
GID00025326	I don't have time to chat right now. If you have business, wait for me to get settled in.
GID00025327	Well, what do we have here, huh? Let me guess. You've heard about the mistress who makes all your fantasies come true.
GID00025328	So you've followed the call of your desires... all the way to the arms of Joana, moi. Now that you've found me, I wonder, do you have what it takes?
GID00025329	Hey there, gorgeous. I knew you'd be back soon enough.
GID00025331	I hear you been asking questions about me, dickweed. What the fuck do you want?
GID00025332	You again? What the fuck do you want?
GID00025333	Hey, hey! Look who it is. My best buddy.
GID00025334	Hey, what can I do for you?
GID00025335	I'm getting the heck out of here. You go place that thermite and do what you need to do.
GID00025336	Give me some time. I'm going to deploy the thermite.
GID00025337	Yeah, nice work destroying those guns, I'm gonna beat feet before they figure out I was involved.
GID00025338	Hey, you're Cachino's friend. You got business with me?
GID00025339	Have you found out anything to help me?
GID00025340	Man, thanks for finding out that shit, fuck Big Sal.
GID00025341	Thanks for taking care of getting me out of here. I owe you big time.
GID00025342	Who are you? I didn't do anything, leave me alone.
GID00025343	You again? Make it quick.
GID00025344	You're always welcome here, good to see you again. Let's chat, what's on your mind?
GID00025345	Hey, you're the one everyone's talking about. What business you got with me?
GID00025346	What do you need? I'm a busy man.
GID00025347	Hey Buddy, Zoara is off limits to everyone but Family.
GID00025348	Go ahead and talk to the bosses, they'll want to hear what you have to say.
GID00025349	Thanks for bringing Cachino's transgressions to our attention. Shame we had to put him down, he was a good lieutenant.
GID00025350	Hey, it's my good friend again. What can I do for you?
GID00025351	Hold up, I gotta have a chat with Cachino.
GID00025352	You got something you need to talk about?
GID00025353	Let's get this going.
GID00025354	Hey, I'm leaving and I don't have anything more to say to you, so get the fuck out of my face.
GID00025355	Hey, nice to meet you. Do you need help with something?
GID00025356	Hey, did you track down some chlorine for me?
GID00025357	Good to see you again, I hope you're winning some money in here.
GID00025358	Hey, what's up?
GID00025359	Okay. We can talk here.
GID00025360	Come here, baby. I'm all yours... are you ready to be all mine?
GID00025361	C'mon, people are looking at us.
GID00025362	It's now or never, let's go.
GID00025363	You truly are something else! Those Omertas looked like they were going to kill Carlitos on the spot.
GID00025364	I have nothing to give you except my thanks... and, well, if I were you I'd not mess around with the Omertas anymore, but listen to this.
GID00025365	Cachino has said things that make me think there's a big and nasty operation in the works, something about "getting even" with Mr. House.
GID00025366	Just thought you'd like to know. Okay, I'm getting Carlitos as far away from here as possible. Hope to see you again, bye!
GID00025367	I'm happy to see you again. Carlitos and I have been living here since our escape. We'll never forget what you've done for us.
GID00025368	Oh, no! No, no, no... Carlitos, dead? What, what will I do now?
GID00025369	Hey there, sugar. I'm Dazzle. What can I do for you... or to you? You're so handsome I might just give you a discount.
GID00025370	Hi, honey. I'm Dazzle. What can I do for you... or to you? Every night's ladies night here.
GID00025371	You damn idiot. I just counted those caps you gave me, and there's not enough there!
GID00025372	All those NCR troops should see me to celebrate. Come one, come all!
GID00025373	I'm not letting the Legion make me a slave. Even I have standards.
GID00025374	Guess it's true what they say - the house always wins in the end.
GID00025375	No Mr. House, no NCR, no Legion, no rules! New Vegas is going to be just one wild, never-ending party.
GID00025376	Back again? Did you miss me?
GID00025377	What the fuck do you want now?
GID00025378	Well look, the bully is back. What the hell do you want?
GID00025379	Hello and welcome to Gomorrah. What can I help you with today?
GID00025380	Let's meet in my room, hon. Follow me.
GID00025381	Let's meet in my room, hon. Follow me.
GID00025382	Take a seat! Play to win.
GID00025383	You look like the lucky type, come play the odds.
GID00025384	Play the tables, test your luck.
GID00025385	You gotta play big to win big.
GID00025386	Feeling lucky?
GID00025387	Sorry, can't let you play here.
GID00025388	You're cut off.
GID00025389	Try the Tops, your money is no good here.
GID00025390	Done playing? Try watching some dancers.
GID00025391	Be patient. Don't blow it, now.
GID00025392	I've enjoyed it, hon. But, if you want more of it, you know what you've got to do.
GID00025393	Hey, do you mind? I'm trying to drink myself to the ground, right here. Scram.
GID00025394	Hey, scram. Come bug me when I'm at the diner... if you're a real pain in the ass.
GID00025395	Yeah, what do you want?
GID00025396	Hey, it's you! What's the news?
GID00025397	You've made it! Thank you so much for your help. I owe you more than- Wait! What's that?
GID00025398	Let me guess. You want to know my secret - how I got my beard to grow in so thick.
GID00025399	Just talk to Big Beard next to me, pal. Whoever's got the biggest whiskers, does the talking...
GID00025400	Couldn't stay away, huh?
GID00025401	Well, well, well, if it isn't our whore, Joana... and, I don't believe this. Carlitos!
GID00025402	We had you and the whore clocked from the start, but we thought Carlitos would be long gone by now.
GID00025403	He should've fled with the caps he stole from the family. We Omertas don't forget and now's time to pay for your offenses.
GID00025404	Look, we are going, okay? So, leave us be.
GID00025405	<Omerta Thug, greets player in Gomorrah>
GID00025406	I don't know how we pulled this off, for a minute there I thought we were not going to make it.
GID00025407	Without you, we'd been in the losing end. Thank you so much for your help, friend.
GID00025408	No... Joana! It can't be! She didn't deserve this, she didn't, you hear?
GID00025409	It should've been me, not her... They will pay, right now! Out of my way!
GID00025410	For my beard, I do as I promised.
GID00025411	Hey, friend! It's good to see you again.
GID00025412	This place don't have the glitter of the Strip, but I've got Joana - that's all I'll ever need.
GID00025413	We're ready. Let's get out of here.
GID00025414	Thank you for your help!
GID00025415	I'm out of here.
GID00025416	C'mon, let's go.
GID00025417	Can't thank you enough for saving us.
GID00025418	Didn't expect things to go so bad - I'm not staying here any longer.
GID00025419	If you're injured, I might have healing powder to spare.
GID00025420	A free woman. It's... been awhile since I've seen a woman who wasn't a slave. I forget myself - are you injured?
GID00025421	With Caesar dead, I'm afraid for the women. The Legate is a brutal man, and he enjoys inflicting pain.
GID00025422	I had hoped to become a great doctor like you someday.
GID00025423	You got Melody her bear back. Very kind of you.
GID00025424	Yes?
GID00025425	So you're the visitor I've heard some of the Legionaries talking about. If you're in the mood to trade, just say the word.
GID00025426	I've heard some bad stories about this Legate. I'm not sure I'll be welcome around here once he takes charge.
GID00025427	Never had you pegged as the doctor-type. Guess I know who to come to now when I get sick.
GID00025428	Howdy again.
GID00025429	Caesar awaits. You can speak with me later.
GID00025430	Caesar is dead at your hands. This crime cannot go unpunished.
GID00025431	I don't understand - the machine was supposed to cure Caesar. You did this - his blood is own your hands.
GID00025432	Your butchery of Caesar will not go unpunished!
GID00025433	Caesar was right to put his trust in you. Your skill in medicine is beyond anything I've ever seen before.
GID00025434	Caesar sleeps but doesn't awaken. I fear it is only a matter of days before death claims him.
GID00025435	You will answer to me until such a time as Caesar is able to resume leadership.
GID00025436	It's a great honor for anyone outside the Legion to get an audience with Caesar.
GID00025437	You've proven yourself to be true friend of the Legion. We have a safehouse available to our agents in the Mojave - here's the key.
GID00025438	It's an excellent place to rest and store extra equipment. In addition, one of our veterans, Atticus, visits the house every few days.
GID00025439	While he's there, you can acquire items useful for stealthy operations against our enemies from him.
GID00025440	Yes? Do you have something to report?
GID00025441	Outsiders are a rare sight at the Fort. Step carefully around here and you might just leave alive. I'm Antony, master of the hounds.
GID00025442	Damn it. I thought they had you.
GID00025443	It'll be strange not having Caesar in command, but Legate Lanius is a strong leader.
GID00025444	I'm sure you had to use a lot of healing powder on Caesar. Well done.
GID00025445	The mechanical dog you have with you - where did you get it?
GID00025446	What?
GID00025447	You here to fight in the arena? Then you're talking to the right man.
GID00025448	What do you want from me, woman? I'm in charge of the arena, not the cooking pots.
GID00025449	As expected, it wasn't much of a fight, but what can you expect from slaves?
GID00025450	A good fight. Some NCR troopers can be competent fighters.
GID00025451	Unbelievable. You stood against a Ranger in single combat and survived.
GID00025452	Caesar was a great man, but the Legion will become even greater with Legate Lanius at its head.
GID00025453	You've done the Legion a great service by healing whatever was wrong with Caesar.
GID00025454	A woman actually proved useful for once. Caesar was bold to put his life in your hands.
GID00025455	What do you need from me?
GID00025456	I can't talk to you. It's not allowed.
GID00025457	I don't want to talk to you! I hate you!
GID00025458	Hi!
GID00025459	I'm still not allowed to talk to you.
GID00025460	Caesar awaits you. We can talk afterwards.
GID00025461	I suspect you'll be a valuable asset to the Legion - assuming you're really on our side, of course.
GID00025462	This is a moment I'd hoped would not come for many years. Caesar's death puts the Legate Lanius in command now.
GID00025463	I'm pleased that you were able to cure Caesar's malady. Though the Legate is a fine leader, we yet need the wisdom of Caesar to guide the Legion.
GID00025464	Was there more for us to discuss?
GID00025465	Mercy...
GID00025466	The eyes of the mighty Caesar are upon you. He appreciates your service, and bestows upon you the exceptional gift of his Mark.
GID00025467	My Lord requires your presence at his camp, at Fortification Hill. His Mark will guarantee your safe-conduct through our lands.
GID00025468	The eyes of the mighty Caesar are upon you. He admires your accomplishments, and bestows upon you the exceptional gift of his Mark.
GID00025469	Any crimes you may have perpetrated against the Legion are hereby forgiven. Caesar will not extend this mercy a second time.
GID00025470	My Lord requires your presence at his camp, at Fortification Hill. His Mark will guarantee your safe-conduct through our lands.
GID00025471	Incidentally, it will interest you to know that the man you seek has fled the Strip, and is likely making haste for Caesar's camp as we speak.
GID00025472	Caesar awaits.
GID00025473	Don't bother me - I'm training to become a full Legionary!
GID00025474	One day I'll be part of the Praetorian Guard, you'll see.
GID00025475	I can't wait until they let me fight.
GID00025476	I'm harsh on the children, but they'll be excellent Legionaries. I'm quite proud of them.
GID00025477	The eyes of the mighty Caesar are upon you. He admires your accomplishments, and bestows upon you the exceptional gift of his Mark.
GID00025478	Your crimes against the Legion, including the death of the fearless Vulpes Inculta, are hereby forgiven. Caesar will not extend this mercy again.
GID00025479	My Lord requires your presence at his camp, at Fortification Hill. His Mark will guarantee your safe-conduct through our lands.
GID00025480	Incidentally, it will interest you to know that the man you seek has fled the Strip, and is likely making haste for Caesar's camp as we speak.
GID00025481	Caesar awaits.
GID00025482	Caesar has permitted your weapons to be returned to you while you serve him.
GID00025483	You've carried out Caesar's will, but I must confiscate your equipment again.
GID00025484	Are you ready to proceed into the underground vault?
GID00025485	Caesar has forbidden you to leave until you've carried out his will in the great underground vault.
GID00025486	You may go.
GID00025487	None may enter without Caesar's permission.
GID00025488	The Legion is aware of your mercenary ways and has decided to encourage you work for us rather than against us.
GID00025489	I've provided you the location of a drop box. Every few days, we'll place Legion coin inside.
GID00025490	Though you aren't of the Legion, you've aided us more than once. We acquire many items on our raids, some useless to us, some forbidden.
GID00025491	I've provided you the location of a drop box where you can obtain these items. The box will be replenished every few days.
GID00025492	Please be aware that we'll assume any items left in the box will be unwanted and be removed and destroyed.
GID00025493	My message to you has been delivered, and I've got other places to be.
GID00025494	You must enter Caesar's tent alone. Anyone else must remain outside.
GID00025495	Here - these are the supplies I've acquired for you.
GID00025496	I'll be back in a few days with more supplies. See you then.
GID00025497	Under penalty of death, the prisoner is forbidden to speak with you until Caesar has permitted it.
GID00025498	Caesar didn't become sick until he started dealing with you. If this was all some trick to assassinate him, we will have revenge.
GID00025499	Caesar is near death. Have you brought the means to cure him?
GID00025500	We don't have time to talk, let's get this fight going.
GID00025501	Please don't interrupt me right now.
GID00025502	Keene has never liked me. If anyone can talk him into backing down, it'll have to be you.
GID00025503	Marcus isn't going to be happy about the deaths, but I guess they were unavoidable. At least I got a lot of useful data from the experiment.
GID00025504	This brief test might not yield a cure any time soon. If the prototype was constantly in use on a living subject, however...
GID00025505	Perhaps Lily might be willing to wear the prototype for a longer duration. The data would be invaluable.
GID00025506	I think those Nightkin are going cause a lot of trouble, but I guess giving them the specs was better than killing them.
GID00025507	I did get a lot of useful data from the experiment, and I'm much closer to a cure than I was before.
GID00025508	It's occurred to me that this brief test might not yield a cure any time soon. However, if Lily were to continue to wear the prototype...
GID00025509	Nice work with the Nightkin. I've never seen anyone able to talk their kind out of anything once they had their mind set to it.
GID00025510	I got a lot of useful data from the experiment and am a lot closer to a cure than before.
GID00025511	It's occurred to me that this brief test might not yield a cure any time soon. However, if Lily were to continue to wear the prototype...
GID00025512	Have you come to a decision on Lily? I'll need to know before I can do anything else.
GID00025513	My request is perfectly reasonable. Give us the Stealth Boy specs and there will be no need for us to splatter the room with your insides.
GID00025514	Don't you still have business with Doctor Henry? You and I are done.
GID00025515	That Keene, always causing trouble.
GID00025516	Be careful with Keene. He's got a mean temper.
GID00025517	Looks like you've hit a lucky streak there. You must be thirsty by now - here, have a drink on the house and keep on playing!
GID00025518	Baby, Lady Luck must be smiling at you today! Compliments of the Tops Casino, enjoy this fine meal and please, keep playing those games!
GID00025519	You've been good to us, baby - now let us be good to you. We'd like you to enjoy this private suite as long as you're in town.
GID00025520	Okay, pal, you've had enough. Time for you to leave.
GID00025521	Welcome to The Tops. How can I help you?
GID00025522	Humbly at your service.
GID00025523	Welcome to the Atomic Wrangler. Looking to exchange?
GID00025524	Welcome to Gomorrah, how can I help you?
GID00025525	Welcome to Vikki and Vance. Can I help you with an exchange?
GID00025526	I must say, fortune seems to be with you of late. Please, enjoy this, compliments of the White Glove Society.
GID00025527	You certainly seem to be making a splash with all your success in the casino. Our executive chef prepared this delicacy for you himself. Enjoy.
GID00025528	You are quite simply the talk of the casino right now with your astonishing play. Do stay in our Bon Vivant suite so you may continue to dazzle us.
GID00025529	This simply will not do. You must leave immediately.
GID00025530	Fancy meeting you here, friend.
GID00025531	Hey there, friend.
GID00025532	Well butter my butt and call me a biscuit, if it ain't my old friend from Goodsprings!
GID00025533	Well... don't that beat all - it's my old friend from Goodsprings!
GID00025534	Well howdy, pardner! You made it out of Goodsprings no worse for the wear. Good for you.
GID00025535	I reckon you'll be tracking down that varmint now. A man puts you in a grave has it coming if you ask me.
GID00025536	Damn, son, you look like ten miles of bad road.
GID00025537	A piece of advice: Watch yourself around No-Bark... I think he's studying to be a half-wit.
GID00025538	You need to be careful, it's dangerous out here!
GID00025539	You should go talk to Blake or Alice, they handle most of our contact with visitors.
GID00025540	You should go talk to Blake or Alice, they handle most of our contact with visitors.
GID00025541	Hello again. How's your Boomer friend?
GID00025542	Have you spoken with McLafferty yet?
GID00025543	You tried to get me killed. Get the hell out of my face.
GID00025544	I'm on my way to meet that Boomer you told me about!
GID00025545	Thank you for getting me here. Jack is a great guy.
GID00025546	Hey there! Here's the rest of the payment I promised you back in Goodsprings.
GID00025547	Hey there, friend.
GID00025548	Welcome to the Crimson Caravan Company, New Vegas branch. What may I do for you?
GID00025549	Welcome back.
GID00025550	Shove off. You're making my luck turn bad.
GID00025551	You again. What do you want now?
GID00025552	If you're looking to buy or sell, you've come to the right man. The Crimson Caravan Company has the widest selection in the wasteland.
GID00025553	Hey there. You looking to buy or sell?
GID00025554	I knew you'd make it. Resourceful, as always.
GID00025555	The override module is functioning properly. I'm rerouting power to the Securitron vault at the Fort as we speak...
GID00025556	I just need you to head over to the east power plant and manually activate the switch.
GID00025557	When you return topside, I think you'll see that my Securitron army is a little more than the Legion was prepared to handle.
GID00025558	Oh, and before you go - grab that print-out spooling from the console here - those papers set the terms for the NCR's unconditional surrender.
GID00025559	I thought you might enjoy the honor of presenting them to the NCR's commanding officer, once the Legion has been defeated. Cheers!
GID00025560	I've been sent to take you back to the Lucky 38. Are you ready to go?
GID00025561	Thanks for setting me straight.
GID00025562	Get lost.
GID00025563	Oh! What are you doing here?
GID00025564	Aren't you the guy that helped wipe out Nelson?
GID00025565	Holy shit man, that's fucking crazy!
GID00025566	Aren't you the gal that helped wipe out Nelson?
GID00025567	Holy shit, that's fucking crazy!
GID00025568	Aren't you the one that saved President Kimball? That must have been some speech, eh?
GID00025569	I heard President Kimball was assassinated during his visit to Hoover Dam. Doesn't surprise me, we're all going to end up dead soon anyway.
GID00025570	I heard President Kimball almost got killed during his visit to Hoover Dam. Good thing he didn't come here, he would be dead for sure.
GID00025571	You're new here aren't you? Don't tell me we're actually going to get reinforcements.
GID00025572	Look at the big hero. You here to save us?
GID00025573	I've heard of you. Did you figure on coming out here and helping us lowly troopers out?
GID00025574	Just what we need around here, a loose cannon causing more trouble.
GID00025575	I've heard of you, what do you want?
GID00025576	What the fuck are you doing here?
GID00025577	What do you want?
GID00025578	We're all going to die out here. They're out there right now, waiting for us... waiting to kill us.
GID00025579	We're all fucked!
GID00025580	I don't want to be seen with the likes of you. Get lost.
GID00025581	You're still here? I'm surprised you're not dead or gone by now.
GID00025582	What do you want?
GID00025584	I do wish you'd come and met with me at the Lucky 38 when you first arrived on the Strip. Or after Benny fled, even.
GID00025585	I do wish you'd come and met with me at the Lucky 38 when you first arrived on the Strip. Or after you killed Benny, even.
GID00025586	Quite an honor you spurned, my invite. You would be the first person to set foot inside the Lucky 38 in over 200 years.
GID00025587	But... you still wound up here, right where I wanted you. I knew I could rely on Caesar to return the Platinum Chip to you.
GID00025588	Well! You're here ahead of schedule! I suppose it's just as well...
GID00025589	This is where I wanted you to end up, after all. I knew I could rely on Caesar to give you back the Platinum Chip.
GID00025590	I see that you reached your destination safely. Shall we get to work?
GID00025591	Have you come to your senses? It's not too late to upload the Platinum Chip's data to the primary computer.
GID00025592	Stop wasting time. Go upload the data on the Platinum Chip to the facility's primary computer.
GID00025593	As you know, the Platinum Chip upgrades my Securitrons' operating software. Well... there's an army of them here.
GID00025594	The Securitrons policing the Strip are a fraction of the total number manufactured. The rest, I stored here.
GID00025595	The Platinum Chip is a data-storage device.
GID00025596	I need you to manually upload the data from the Chip to the facility's primary computer. There's a terminal at the other end of this facility.
GID00025597	There's a complication. While I can broadcast to this screen, I can't control any of the facility's systems.
GID00025598	That means I can't deactivate its security bots... most of which appear to be active, according to the status board I'm looking at.
GID00025599	Do you have the slightest idea of what you've done, of what you've destroyed?
GID00025600	You've doomed Vegas to be ruled by corrupt bureaucrats or fanatical savages.
GID00025601	Singlehandedly, you've brought mankind's best hopes of forward progress crashing down. No punishment would be too severe.
GID00025602	Your work here is done. Return to the Lucky 38 so we can discuss next steps.
GID00025603	You have a very bright future ahead of you. Thanks to your actions today, so does the rest of mankind.
GID00025604	Benny is dead, and yet you don't appear to be carrying the Platinum Chip.
GID00025605	I don't suppose you forgot to search his body?
GID00025606	Before we go any further - where is the Platinum Chip?
GID00025607	So, we meet in person finally... so to speak. You did well at the Fort - kudos.
GID00025608	Have you come to your senses - or will there be a repeat of the last incident?
GID00025609	You've been a busy courier, haven't you? You take your obligation to deliver an package very seriously - an ethic for which I am grateful.
GID00025610	I will admit, when you ignored my invitation, I predicted... negative outcomes. But - you have a way of exceeding expectations, don't you?
GID00025611	Well enough. Let's have the Chip, then.
GID00025612	This meeting has been a long time coming, hasn't it? You've come a long ways, literally and, I suspect, figuratively as well.
GID00025613	I have to ask - now that you've reached your destination, what do you make of what you see?
GID00025614	The point of my inviting you to visit me here at the Lucky 38 before stomping into the Tops on your own was to help you prepare - tactically.
GID00025615	Now, because of your carelessness, Benny has fled the Strip, taking with him the Platinum Chip.
GID00025616	Well... this meeting has been a long time in coming... longer still, since you took time to charge into the Tops before coming to see me.
GID00025617	Before we get down to details, I must ask - now that you've arrived at your destination, what do you make of what you see?
GID00025618	Can I look forward to a more substantial conversation this time?
GID00025619	Have you considered the terms of my offer? There's else little for us to discuss until you have.
GID00025620	What is the purpose of this delay?
GID00025621	Events have transpired in a... less-than-optimal fashion. Benny has fled the Strip, and the Platinum Chip has not been recovered.
GID00025622	Benny must be pursued, and the Platinum Chip, recovered.
GID00025623	So... Benny has been handled and you've recovered the Platinum Chip. Let's have it.
GID00025624	I take it you've come to deliver the Platinum Chip?
GID00025625	Such a small thing, isn't it? And yet so... capacious. So very dear.
GID00025626	Decades of hiring salvagers out west to search for this little relic in the ruins of a place called Sunnyvale. Back then, anyway.
GID00025627	That's where the Chip was printed, on October 22, 2077. It was to have been hand-delivered to me here, at the Lucky 38, the next day.
GID00025628	But the bombs fell first. Suffice it to say, the delivery was never made.
GID00025629	Come now, come now... get thee to the elevator.
GID00025630	To the elevator, if you please... Stop dragging your feet.
GID00025631	Trips to the basement are rarely so educational, don't you think?
GID00025632	I've since broadcast the upgrade to every Securitron in range of my transmitters, and I must say, it's causing quite a stir down on the Strip!
GID00025633	Make your way to Caesar's Camp at Fortification Hill. Something very interesting awaits you...
GID00025634	To secure the future of New Vegas, I must have your assistance. The work ahead is dangerous, but you weather danger well.
GID00025635	Have you found the courage to do what's necessary?
GID00025636	What did you wish to know?
GID00025637	What else did you want to know?
GID00025638	We'll talk again once you've concluded your work in the bunker at Fortification Hill.
GID00025639	The foundation is laid. My Securitrons on the Strip are upgraded, and those at the Fort, ready for action.
GID00025640	Now it's just a matter of adjusting the attitudes of some lesser groups while we wait for Caesar's Legion to attack Hoover Dam.
GID00025641	The next step is to add the Boomers' considerable firepower to my growing arsenal... or at the very least, ensure their neutrality.
GID00025642	As I was saying, I need you to enlist or neutralize the Boomers at Nellis Air Force Base.
GID00025643	Any progress with the Boomers?
GID00025644	Your next assignment won't take you far. It concerns the Omertas and their den of vice, Gomorrah.
GID00025645	As the decisive encounter between the bull and the bear looms close, my concerns about the Omertas have grown.
GID00025646	I've never expected loyalty, mind you. A reliably underhanded tribe is just as constant to deal with as one that always run true.
GID00025647	But that's just it - lately the Omertas' cooperative silence has been deafening. Not a single complaint? They're up to something.
GID00025648	Your next assignment would've been to investigate the Omertas, but you managed to foil their scheme before I could put you to the task.
GID00025649	I should compensate you as though it were an official assignment, however. Wouldn't want to disincentivize your proactivity.
GID00025650	I'd hoped to have you investigate the Omertas, but after the trouble you caused at Gomorrah, they won't let you in the front door.
GID00025651	I'll see if I can make some progress with informants. You're useless in this matter.
GID00025652	As I said before, I need you to investigate the Omertas, to see what they're up to.
GID00025653	What do you have to report about the Omertas?
GID00025654	Your next assignment is to locate and destroy remnants of the Mojave chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel.
GID00025655	The NCR nearly did the job at Helios One a few years ago, but there seem to have been survivors, unfortunately.
GID00025656	Given the Brotherhood's fanatical views on technology, they can be counted on to oppose my regime.
GID00025657	Please - put them out of my misery.
GID00025658	As I've said, I need you to locate and destroy the Brotherhood of Steel.
GID00025659	Have you destroyed the Brotherhood of Steel?
GID00025660	Will you ensure that President Kimball survives his visit to Hoover Dam?
GID00025661	Aaron Kimball, the president of the New California Republic, is going to visit Hoover Dam to "boost morale."
GID00025662	Apparently he hasn't considered the effect on the troops' morale of seeing their beloved leader get his brains blown out by a Legion sniper.
GID00025663	I need you to make sure that no harm comes to President Kimball. It's fortunate that you've maintained good relations with the NCR...
GID00025664	Unfortunately, I can't use you to protect Kimball. The NCR won't let you come within a thousand feet of the President.
GID00025665	Odds are that Caesar will launch his assault on the dam after Kimball's visit is concluded, one way or the other - so be on guard.
GID00025666	Unfortunately, I can't very well send you off to protect Kimball. The NCR won't let you come within a thousand feet of the President.
GID00025667	This can be used to our advantage, though it'll a grim business. Go to Hoover Dam and attack the gathering crowd, and his visit will be canceled.
GID00025668	Your reputation with the NCR isn't exactly stellar, so I'll have to vouche for you. It'll make a scene, but it's worth it.
GID00025669	Last I knew, President Kimball wasn't scheduled to visit the Lucky 38. Be on your way to Hoover Dam, will you?
GID00025670	If not for you, President Kimball would be dead. So you needn't feel guilty when the NCR's rout from Hoover Dam demolishes his political career.
GID00025671	Why in the world did you attack President Kimball?
GID00025672	Kimball is dead - what a mess you've made!
GID00025673	Between the Strip and HELIOS One lies the El Dorado electrical substation.
GID00025674	Humble as it appears, the substation has immense strategic value, for it's there that you'll jumpstart the Lucky 38's dormant reactor.
GID00025675	Gain access to the substation's control room and install this override module. Just so you know, there are NCR troops guarding the station.
GID00025676	Until the Lucky 38's reactor has been restarted, we have nothing to discuss.
GID00025677	As you can see, Vegas is humming along. I've tested my c3i broadcasting arrays. Everything is in order.
GID00025678	And just in time, as it turns out. The forces of Caesar's Legion are on the march, establishing a staging area east of the dam.
GID00025679	Their assault could begin at any moment. So that's where you'll be heading, if you're ready - Hoover Dam.
GID00025680	The Legion's assault could begin at any moment.
GID00025681	What did you want to discuss?
GID00025682	What else did you want to discuss?
GID00025683	There will be no repeat of the trouble we had last time, I trust?
GID00025684	I'm optimistic that this conversation will go more smoothly.
GID00025685	I'd rather you just dealt with the Boomers, but all right...
GID00025686	I suppose the Omertas can wait a few minutes.
GID00025687	A few questions, and then you'll handle the Brotherhood, I hope?
GID00025688	Questions like "Will President Kimball survive his visit to Hoover Dam?"
GID00025689	Even now? On the brink of battle?
GID00025690	I knew you'd make it. Resourceful, as always.
GID00025691	The override module is functioning properly. I'm rerouting power to the Securitron vault at the Fort as we speak...
GID00025692	I just need you to head over to the east power plant and manually activate the switch.
GID00025693	When you return topside, I think you'll see that my Securitron army is a little more than the Legion was prepared to handle.
GID00025694	Oh, and before you go - grab that print-out spooling from the console here - those papers set the terms for the NCR's unconditional surrender.
GID00025695	I thought you might enjoy the honor of presenting them to the NCR's commanding officer, once the Legion has been defeated. Cheers!
GID00025696	Why have you... done this?... centuries of preparation... so much good, undone...
GID00025697	I have... nothing... to say... to you...
GID00025698	Antler says you are the one killing my kin. Antler says you must die!
GID00025699	What's that, Antler? We have a visitor?
GID00025700	An assassin, more like! I say kill it, Antler. For safe's sake!
GID00025701	Huh? ...Okay, Antler. I'll ask.
GID00025702	Hi, human. Why you come here?
GID00025703	Antler sings for Stealth Boys. Have you found them?
GID00025704	Where did rest of my kin go? All alone now...
GID00025705	Antler is sad. We Nightkin go now, but there is fewer than when we came here...
GID00025706	Antler is sad, human. Nightkin go now, find Stealth Boys in other places.
GID00025707	You did good, smoothskin. Never thought I'd get out of that room.
GID00025708	Kind of busy running for my life here, smoothskin.
GID00025709	Come and get it, you big dumb -
GID00025710	Hey! You're not one of those things out there. Who the hell are you?
GID00025711	Did you find my friend?
GID00025712	What do you want now, smoothskin?
GID00025713	Hi there. I'm Old Lady Gibson, or so they tell me. I've got odds and ends for sale, and I'm pretty good at fixing things, too.
GID00025714	You might have noticed the very large building just north of here. That's HELIOS One. The NCR runs the place, so it's off-limits to prospectors.
GID00025715	So you're back. Now, where did we leave off?
GID00025716	I don't speak with outsiders, smoothskins especially. Talk to our leader, Jason Bright.
GID00025717	Sorry, we don't talk to outsiders. Talk to Jason if you have business here.
GID00025718	Jason will lead us to the Far Beyond!
GID00025719	Jason will deliver us from the pain of this world!
GID00025720	All praise the Great Journey! All praise the creator's divine will!
GID00025721	The holy fire will carry us to our salvation!
GID00025722	Thank you for taking care of the demons, smoothskin.
GID00025723	Now that the demons are gone, we can finally begin our final steps.
GID00025724	The demons are really gone? Bright shines!
GID00025725	Not now, smoothskin!
GID00025726	Welcome to the Dino Bite Gift Shop. My name's Cliff. If you're here for the t-rex figurines, you're just in time. There's still a few left.
GID00025727	Welcome back. Please don't kill me. I'll give you a real nice price on everything.
GID00025728	I don't know if you know, but since Jeannie May passed, I've been keeping an eye on her properties for her.
GID00025729	I think it's time we gave something back to you, so take this key and make yourself at home at our motel.
GID00025730	It'll open the room on the second floor, closest to the lobby. Hope it suits you.
GID00025731	Welcome back. Can I get you anything?
GID00025732	Hey there. If you want to buy something from my shop, you'll have to wait till it opens.
GID00025733	Who sent you? I ain't talking. They tried to get me to talk before, but I didn't say nothing. And I don't aim to now, by gum.
GID00025734	You've seen them too, haven't you? I can see it in your eyes. I knew I wasn't the only one.
GID00025735	Hello, wanderer. Please forgive us of our humble surroundings. Our true home awaits us in the Far Beyond.
GID00025736	Have you come to help us complete the Great Journey?
GID00025737	I apologize, wanderer, but I must go tend to my flock!
GID00025738	I waited to speak with you one last time before I descended to the launch pad, wanderer.
GID00025739	I want you to know that we will remember for all eternity how you delivered us to the threshold of the Great Journey.
GID00025740	Our preparations are nearly complete, but the rockets that will carry us to salvation are yet missing vital components.
GID00025741	If you would still help us, wanderer, speak to Chris. He can tell you what is missing.
GID00025742	There is no way that we can thank you enough, wanderer. Your arrival here was a blessing. We will remember you always.
GID00025743	Forgive me, wanderer, but my flock awaits.
GID00025744	Is the way clear?
GID00025745	Will you help us, wanderer?
GID00025746	I don't think we got any more to discuss here.
GID00025747	Is everything all right? Awful late to be dropping in unexpected.
GID00025748	Well. Welcome to you. You look tired from the road. Why don't you relax a spell, let this fine town take care of you?
GID00025749	I hope you're finding everything to your liking.
GID00025750	We haven't met yet. You must be new in town. I'm Andy.
GID00025751	Boy you picked that takedown right up. I'm impressed. Must've had some prior training, huh?
GID00025752	You'll get the hang of that takedown. I had trouble learning it at first, too.
GID00025753	What's new?
GID00025754	You have any luck with the ghouls? I'm counting on you.
GID00025755	What's going on, man?
GID00025756	Sorry, I ain't really up to entertaining visitors right now. I'm worried about Dusty.
GID00025757	What brings you here?
GID00025758	You seen Alice? Ain't like her to be gone this long.
GID00025759	Hey there. In from out of town, ain't you? Name's Dusty.
GID00025760	Find anything?
GID00025761	Things treating you all right?
GID00025762	Did you see all the commotion at REPCONN? I hope that doesn't mean trouble for our town.
GID00025763	Hey, there. Been to the top of the dino yet?
GID00025764	I could've sworn we were under attack. Did you see those rockets?
GID00025765	If you're planning on staying awhile, the Dino Dee-lite's got plenty of room.
GID00025766	I really hope that incident at REPCONN doesn't drive people away. Novac was starting to do well!
GID00025767	With all the people passing through lately, the town's been doing better than, well, ever.
GID00025768	All the noise at REPCONN scared the hell out of me.
GID00025769	Don't listen to a word No-bark says. I don't think he ever sleeps, so it's no wonder he spouts nothing but nonsense.
GID00025770	Gathering junk's not the most exciting work, but it's a living.
GID00025771	Good thing none of those rockets crashed into Novac.
GID00025772	If it weren't for the water caravans, Novac would've turned to dust a long time ago.
GID00025773	Those rockets over at REPCONN were the NCR's doing. Trying to keep us scared so they can stick around to "protect" us.
GID00025774	The salvage business has really slowed down since those ghouls took over REPCONN.
GID00025775	Any word on Station Charlie?
GID00025776	I don't want to get shot!
GID00025777	It's about time a new customer showed up around here. Was getting sick of dealing with the same faces all the time.
GID00025778	I can't believe the NCR actually showed up. We sure showed them, though. Right?
GID00025779	What's up?
GID00025780	There's still more troopers out there!
GID00025781	I know all the guys I did time with around here and you ain't one of them. Can't fool me with that Powder Ganger getup.
GID00025782	Okay, I know I wasn't serving time with no girl, or I'd have heard about it. You come to play with the Powder Gangers?
GID00025783	Look at you, walking in here like you're one of us. Don't you know this is Powder Ganger territory?
GID00025784	Hey there, girlie. You here to party with the Powder Gangers?
GID00025785	Did you see me take out that NCR trooper? Right through his eye!
GID00025786	What do you want now?
GID00025787	I knew I should've gone with Cooke!
GID00025788	Heard there was a new face around. I'm the doctor around here... sort of.
GID00025789	That... was close. I really need to find some nice, quiet place to settle.
GID00025790	Sticking around, I see.
GID00025791	Have you gotten my pardon from the NCR yet?
GID00025792	Thanks for getting me that pardon. Me and the boys will take good care of Primm, don't you worry.
GID00025793	I can do right by this town, they were in need of some frontier justice.
GID00025794	Sounds like the NCR is finally getting off their ass to settle things around here. Don't expect me to get in their way.
GID00025795	Maybe you ought to worry about the guys trying to kill you first.
GID00025796	Didn't know anyone would willingly walk into this place, not unless they were looking for trouble. What's your story?
GID00025797	Need to talk about something?
GID00025798	What are you looking at?
GID00025799	Will you quit bothering me?
GID00025800	No time to talk. We've got trouble.
GID00025801	Not half bad in a fight, are you? I figure you had a lot to do with me still breathing after all that.
GID00025802	I don't have any more work for you, but feel free to stick around as long as you want. You never know when the NCR will be back.
GID00025803	Dawes said he let somebody in. So, you going to give me a reason not to kill you and throw your body back outside?
GID00025804	You're the one Cobb mentioned. Maybe you feel like helping us out around here.
GID00025805	Not bad in a fight, are you? I really thought the NCR had us in their sights that time.
GID00025806	I've been thinking that since you've been good to us, we can be good to you.
GID00025807	We've got plenty of spare powder and dynamite around. Say the word and we can give you some of it every couple of days.
GID00025808	I don't know what to make of you, you know that? I know I can't really trust you, that's for sure.
GID00025809	Still, you've helped us out some, so maybe I ought to repay you some. I've spread the word about you to a bunch of guys out in the wasteland.
GID00025810	As long as you're not an enemy, they'll cut you some slack when you're near their camps. Trespass too long and they'll come after you.
GID00025811	What?
GID00025812	Shut up and fight!
GID00025813	I'm Sergeant Lee. Lieutenant Hayes radioed ahead to say you were on the way.
GID00025814	We've got surprise on our side, and that's about it. Once we blow a gap in the fence, we've got to pour on the fire and keep them disorganized.
GID00025815	Our goal's to take out their leader, some assbag named Eddie. With the ringleader gone, the rest will fold.
GID00025816	That's all the briefing you're going to get. Let's go.
GID00025817	We can take it from here. We might have some cleaning up to do, but Eddie's a deadie. Gangs with no leadership don't last long.
GID00025818	I'll radio Hayes to let him know the prison's ours. But you should swing by to see him the next time you're near Primm.
GID00025819	Thanks for the help.
GID00025820	You just walked into the wrong camp, my friend. Hand over everything you've got and we might let you live.
GID00025821	I got the message. You won't see me around these parts again.
GID00025822	Hey, I've been sent to tell you that, while you're not exactly a friend, we know you've helped us out some all the same.
GID00025823	We figure some kind of truce is in order. As long as you don't come too close to any of our camps, we'll let you pass without trying to kill you.
GID00025824	Of course, the truce is off once we know you're an enemy.
GID00025825	Got nothing else to say to you.
GID00025826	Better be careful around these parts. I hear there's Powder Gangers around and dangerous for merchants like me.
GID00025827	Well, well. It's about time one of you guys came along. I figure the NCR would pay a pretty good bounty for a Powder Ganger.
GID00025828	Hadn't heard there were women Powder Gangers, but a bounty's a bounty. The NCR will probably pay up either way.
GID00025829	You won't see me around here again.
GID00025830	What brings you back?
GID00025831	Now that McNamara's lifted that silly lockdown of his, perhaps people around here will come to appreciate our training simulations.
GID00025832	Perhaps there will be a renewed interest in them as people realize just how close to reality they are... but I digress. What did you want?
GID00025833	Now that Hardin's Elder, I hope I'll be allowed to continue my experiments. I never quite liked the way he looked at me during meetings.
GID00025834	Like he wanted to use me for target practice. The man just has no respect for science! But enough of this. What did you want?
GID00025835	Yes? What is it?
GID00025836	I'll track the virus from over here. You just concentrate on locating the terminals hosting it.
GID00025837	Look, this isn't a great ti- oh, what the hell, it's not like we're making any progress. I'm Ibsen, and I hope your day is going better than mine is.
GID00025838	Did you want to try isolating the virus?
GID00025839	You actually did it! If you don't mind my saying so, I didn't think you had a chance in hell of pulling it off.
GID00025840	But I'm glad to be wrong for once! Thank you, my friend. Please, feel free to access the datastore at your leisure.
GID00025841	I'm only allowed to give you access to non-classified topics, but it's better than nothing, right?
GID00025842	Hello again, my friend. I hope you've been finding the information in the datastore useful.
GID00025843	Welcome to the range. Feel free to use any open lane.
GID00025844	Ah, outsider. I've heard that you were instrumental in providing Hardin with the evidence to bring against me. And here I had thought to use you.
GID00025845	Have you come to gloat, or did you actually want something?
GID00025846	Welcome, outsider, welcome! The lockdown has been officially lifted and everyone seems to be in good spirits.
GID00025847	With the surface open to us once again, Hardin's already started talk of sending a force out to attack HELIOS, but I hope to dissuade him.
GID00025848	What can I do for you?
GID00025849	Hail, Brother. May I help you?
GID00025850	Greetings, my friend. I hope I can be of some assistance to you.
GID00025851	I apologize, outsider, but I'm going to be busy for a little while making preparations for lifting the lockdown.
GID00025852	What is it now, outsider?
GID00025853	I'm afraid I don't have time to talk, outsider. I've had word that Hardin is charging me with violating protocol and must prepare a defense.
GID00025854	Back again, I see. Have you found all the components we need?
GID00025855	Have you had any luck finding the scouts? Or did you have something to discuss?
GID00025856	Found the missing patrols, or was something else on your mind?
GID00025857	How did you find us, stranger? And do tell the truth.
GID00025858	I've been informed that you bring us ill tidings, stranger. Care to elaborate?
GID00025859	When Paladin Ramos informed me that Veronica was approaching with an outsider in tow, at first I didn't know what to think.
GID00025860	After giving the matter some thought, however, I've decided that an outsider could be of use to me right now.
GID00025861	However, I will not force you to help us. Should you refuse, you will be allowed to leave here, though you'd remain Veronica's responsibility.
GID00025862	What do you say, outsider? Are you willing to help us?
GID00025863	What I wished to discuss with you can wait for once I get settled in the command room, outsider.
GID00025864	When you first showed up on our doorstep, I'll admit at first I didn't know what to think.
GID00025865	After giving the matter some thought, however, I've decided that an outsider could be of great use to me right now.
GID00025866	However, I will not force you to help us. Should you refuse, you will be allowed to leave here, though know we will be keeping an eye on you.
GID00025867	What do you say, outsider? Are you willing to help us?
GID00025868	How did you resolve the situation with the ranger?
GID00025869	Have you reconsidered, outsider? I can still use your help.
GID00025870	Yes, associate?
GID00025871	Hey, I heard the pistol got returned. Thanks a lot! I am never going to listen to Watkins again, believe me.
GID00025872	I really hope you can find that pistol.
GID00025873	Yes, can I help you?
GID00025874	Sorry, but I'm a little busy here. If you'll excuse me.
GID00025875	The lockdown is lifted! The patrols are going to start up again! Do you know what this means? I'll actually be able to get into a real fight!
GID00025876	I wonder what it'll be against? Raiders? Radscorpions? Deathclaws? Oh, I can't wait. So what's up?
GID00025877	Hey, so Hardin becoming Elder was because of you, huh? Good job. Now that the lockdown if lifted, I may get a chance to get into a real fight!
GID00025878	I wonder what it'll be against? Raiders? Radscorpions? Deathclaws? Oh, I can't wait. So what's up?
GID00025879	I hear you handled the NCR ranger that was camping out topside.
GID00025880	Don't get a big head or anything about it. I would have taken him out if they'd let me.
GID00025881	Yeah?
GID00025882	You'll find your equipment in the chest to your right. Don't bother coming back until you've dealt with the ranger.
GID00025883	Stand back from the door. The Elder's eager to hear your report.
GID00025884	[You hear nothing.]
GID00025885	Where did you learn that password? And tell the truth, because I'll know if you're lying.
GID00025886	Listen up. I'm in charge of security around here, and I can't say I'm too happy having an outsider waltzing around.
GID00025887	But since you came in with Veronica, I'm inclined to cut you a little slack. Just behave yourself and we won't have any problems, okay?
GID00025888	Oh, and the Elder's going to want to talk to you. He's on the second level. Just take a right once you get down there.
GID00025889	My office is right here in case you need anything. Just ask for Ramos.
GID00025890	How the hell did you get in here? Normally, I would have already shot you, but I'm under orders to bring you to the Elder. Will you come peacefully?
GID00025891	Rest up, and make your report to the Elder when you're up to it.
GID00025892	If you have something to say, say it to Elder McNamara.
GID00025893	Your presence here... Let's just say it's highly irregular.
GID00025894	Outsiders aren't even allowed to know that our bunker's here, let alone come and go freely.
GID00025895	You impressed Elder McNamara, obviously. He must believe that you'll be very useful.
GID00025896	Oh, hey there. Something I can help you with?
GID00025897	No time to talk now. I have to get ready to return to base with this information. I'll get a fat raise for this, if anyone actually believes me.
GID00025898	Okay, so you weren't kidding about there being a Brotherhood base here.
GID00025899	I'll need to report back to base about this. They'll think I'm playing a prank if I try to radio it in, so I'll need some face time with the brass.
GID00025900	Thanks for the heads up. I mean it. I'll be sure to mention you in my report.
GID00025901	Shhh. I thought I heard something up by the entrance.
GID00025902	Now, now. Calm down. I believe you saw something. Let's just head back to my camp and we'll figure out what it was, okay?
GID00025903	Sorry, but I've got a long hike ahead of me. You take care.
GID00025904	Powder ganger scum! Hands up or die!
GID00025905	Thought you'd sneak up on me, you filthy powder ganger?
GID00025906	Oh, it's you. Any particular reason you felt the need to bother me again?
GID00025907	You must be the stranger I've been hearing about. Sorry, but I'm strictly forbidden from offering our tech to outsiders like yourself.
GID00025908	Besides, I'm a little busy right now.
GID00025909	Sorry, outsider, but I'm not allowed to sell you anything without the Elder's say so.
GID00025910	Besides, I'm a little busy right now.
GID00025911	I can't believe Hardin is Elder now. At least with the lockdown lifted I'll be able to resupply my store more often. So what are you here for?
GID00025912	Have you heard the news? Elder McNamara has lifted the lockdown! Good news for this store, let me tell you. I can't wait to start getting more goods.
GID00025913	So what are you here for?
GID00025914	The word came down from the Elder that I'm to offer you some of our lesser wares, as if I didn't have other matters on my mind.
GID00025915	Have you found it? I need to give my report to Hardin soon.
GID00025916	Hi there. Looking to spend some caps?
GID00025917	You again? Didn't I tell you I was busy?
GID00025918	Listen very closely and do as I say. Your life depends on it.
GID00025919	Hand over everything you're carrying. Weapons, ammo, clothes, armor - everything. I want you stripped down to your underwear.
GID00025920	Save it for Paladin Ramos, outsider.
GID00025921	I said shut up and keep moving.
GID00025922	You're the one with that robot, I was hoping you'd bring him my way. Pretty impressive piece of hardware.
GID00025923	I can't say that I've seen anything quite like him before.
GID00025924	Hmmm? Oh, you must be the outsider everyone's buzzing about. Pleased to meet you. I'm Lorenzo, Senior Knight and general handyman around here.
GID00025925	Hey, good to see you again. Have you thought any more about letting me take a look at the logs on your robot?
GID00025926	Good to see you! Alive, that is. Have you found all of the components yet?
GID00025927	Good to see you again. What can I help you with?
GID00025928	What do you want? And don't try anything funny.
GID00025929	That report must reach the Elder's hands. I have nothing further to give you.
GID00025930	Don't take another step if you value your life. For what purpose do you approach me?
GID00025931	The Elder is likely urgently awaiting that report. You should make your way to him as soon as possible.
GID00025932	Approach slowly, stranger. If you have no business with me, then go.
GID00025933	Quick now, off with you! The Elder must see that report!
GID00025934	It looks like you've managed to talk some sense into the Elder, outsider. Be assured, I'll still be keeping an eye on him.
GID00025935	Your efforts to help this chapter are not unappreciated. Now, what can I do for you?
GID00025936	Welcome, my friend. A new day has dawned for this chapter, and moving forward we will no longer cower in the dark.
GID00025937	And we have you to thank for it. You'll find that I can be generous to those who show loyalty.
GID00025938	Here, take this key. If you ever find yourself in need of repair, head to our safehouse to the northeast.
GID00025939	Now, what can I do for you?
GID00025940	Are you willing to listen to me now, outsider?
GID00025941	Have you reconsidered helping me, outsider? I do what I must to see that the chapter survives.
GID00025942	What is it, outsider? Have you discovered anything?
GID00025943	Welcome back, my friend. What can I do for you?
GID00025944	What do you want, outsider?
GID00025945	I appreciate all you've done, but I'm going to have my hands full for a little while. Come back later and we'll talk.
GID00025946	I heard we have you to thank for McNamara having a change of heart. Thank you. So what can I do for you?
GID00025947	There's a rumor going around that you were behind Hardin's takeover. I suppose his leadership is better than none at all. Time will tell.
GID00025948	So what brings you by today?
GID00025949	Hello, you must be the outsider everyone is talking about. I'm Linda Schuler. If you ever need medical attention, this is the place to come.
GID00025950	Hello. Can I help you with something?
GID00025951	Charging a casino full of heavily-armed gangsters was a great idea, boss. Definitely not the kind of thing that could have gotten us both killed.
GID00025952	Not to worry, boss. I'm sure killing the boss of one of the Families will in no way lead to savage, bloody reprisals against you and your loved ones.
GID00025953	If we run, we might still catch Benny! Well, you might. I'll just be wheezing along behind you.
GID00025954	You really enjoy dragging me into situations where I get shot at, don't you boss?
GID00025955	Ahh, overly-elaborate mob schemes to take over Vegas. Reminds me of the days before the War.
GID00025956	I can't believe we're allowed inside the Lucky 38. That place has been a legend since before the War....
GID00025957	Angry soldier robots with bazookas. I'm sure they'll be a good police force.
GID00025958	Maybe I'm just old and tired, but being locked in a cool, dark pod to sleep for a few centuries doesn't sound so bad.
GID00025959	Eesh, boss. Just... eesh.
GID00025960	Don't worry boss, I'm sure Caesar just wants to invite you over for coffee or something. That's all.
GID00025961	Hey boss, that surgery reminded me of something: I got this funny lump right down here... think you could take a look at it?
GID00025962	I'm glad you decided to off one of the most powerful men in the Mojave. Life was getting boring anyways. Really.
GID00025963	Yeah, Caesar, let's give you brain surgery in a tent. That can't possibly go wrong.
GID00025964	Caesar's death reminds me of an old saying. I can't quite remember it now, something like "sic semper tyrannosaurus."
GID00025965	Oh, good. Now there's an army of robots. You don't do things by halves, do you, boss?
GID00025966	Did blowing up that vault serve a purpose, or do you just like explosions?
GID00025967	Those poor NCR soldiers... now where will they get their hookers and gambling?
GID00025968	Be honest, you did it for the ticker-tape parades, huh boss?
GID00025969	Don't worry, boss. I'll make sure your biography says you "heroically changed your mind" about killing the president, not "choked under pressure."
GID00025970	Just to be clear, we're not planning to visit any NCR facilities, right boss? Like, ever again?
GID00025971	Well, the President's dead, but don't worry. History has shown that that sort of thing almost never leads to massive destabilizations or world wars.
GID00025972	Never been a big fan of gangs like the Fiends, boss. I'm glad they're gone.
GID00025973	The Khans didn't seem so bad to me, but what do I know? I was locked up in a cell by a crazy Nightkin for years.
GID00025974	Do you often go toe-to-toe with guys dressed as tanks, boss? That might not be great for your life expectancy.
GID00025975	I'm sure pissing off a ruthless warlord with a tribe of fanatically-devoted warriors was a good move. How could it not be? It was your idea.
GID00025976	I'm sure pissing off a massive government with a huge army at its disposal was a good move. How could it not be? It was your idea.
GID00025977	I'm sure pissing off the two most powerful factions in the Mojave was a good move. How could it not be? It was your idea.
GID00025978	Don't worry, boss. I'm sure the sudden tension in the air is just... a thunderstorm?
GID00025979	Okay, so maybe I was wrong about the thunderstorm thing. I admit it.
GID00025980	Looks like this is gonna be the big one, boss. If you're ready, I'm with you.
GID00025981	What can I do for you, boss?
GID00025982	Took you long enough. So, can I go now?
GID00025983	I haven't heard a fresh batch of crazy coming out of the radio in a while. Does that mean I can leave?
GID00025984	Back again? Can I go this time, or do you have something else in mind?
GID00025985	Oh, it's you. You need something repaired or something?
GID00025986	I... don't know how to thank you for bringing Rhonda back to me, stranger.
GID00025987	Here, take this. I won't be needing it anymore.
GID00025988	Good work, human. Maybe now this place can rest in peace.
GID00025989	There's nothing for you here, human, though it is always good to see you.
GID00025990	I've done what I can. The rest is up to you, human.
GID00025991	This is a dangerous place, human - especially for your kind! I suggest you turn back. There's nothing good waiting for you further on.
GID00025992	Still hanging about?
GID00025993	Hey, you've interrupted my broadcast, dumb-dumb - so there had better be a good reason! What is it?
GID00025994	A pleasant surprise to see you made it. I'm ready to get started if you are.
GID00025995	We shouldn't wait much longer. Are you ready?
GID00025996	There's an intruder in the dish hut! Get over there and kill whoever it is, you fools!
GID00025997	I don't even remember where we were going, but It'll be good to travel around with Rhonda again.
GID00025998	Fiends... cracked-out junkies. All those chems make them a real bitch to take down.
GID00025999	We should be taking the fight to the Legion, not waiting for them to pick us apart.
GID00026000	I really hope General Oliver has a good plan if the Legion comes back.
GID00026001	Colonel Hsu really knows what he's doing. Now if only someone'd explain that to ol' General Wait-and-See Oliver...
GID00026002	I pity anyone who crosses Boyd. That woman is relentless.
GID00026003	We still haven't gotten Ranger Morales' body back from the Fiends. Sure doesn't inspire confidence in the guys you're serving with.
GID00026004	Damn shame about Morales. She enlisted to be closer to her husband.
GID00026005	Contreras is holding out on me. I know he's got more to sell.
GID00026006	Man, Doc Kemp really fixed me up right the last time I got shot. He's the man to see if you need some fixin'.
GID00026007	Farber is doing the best with what he's got, but man could I go for a nice cut of brahmin steak.
GID00026008	I appreciate the improvements in the mess. Keep up the good work.
GID00026009	These recruits aren't ready, if the Legion comes knocking.
GID00026010	Get running the obstacle course, if you want. You look like you could use some exercise.
GID00026011	I'm busy. See the brass if you want to chat.
GID00026012	No time for idle chatter. These boys need whipping into shape.
GID00026013	Either join the recruits running the course or leave the area.
GID00026014	You look like someone in need of a reliable supplier.
GID00026015	So you're back.
GID00026016	Did the colonel send you? I... I was hoping he might have changed his mind...
GID00026017	Got to keep hoping the Colonel will change his mind... maybe send somebody to bring Esteban's body home.
GID00026018	Did you start looking for Esteban? I guess my directions could've been better...
GID00026019	Feels better knowing that Esteban's not out there in the waste. But... he's still gone, you know?
GID00026020	What do you want?
GID00026021	What did Contreras say?
GID00026022	Paperwork, paperwork, paperwork... It just never ends.
GID00026023	Good thing I got stationed here and not at the Dam. I got connections because Major Dhatri's daughter married my nephew.
GID00026024	Whoa whoa whoa. Hold up. Where do you think you're going?
GID00026025	Hey, good luck. We'd be there with you, but the Colonel said he'd have our necks if we tried.
GID00026026	Be careful out there. We already lost Jackson doing what you're trying to do.
GID00026027	Hell of a thing you did up there.
GID00026028	Proud to have met you, sir.
GID00026029	Proud to have met you, ma'am.
GID00026030	Listen, asshole. I know you're not really an NCR health inspector, so you can cut the restaurant critic routine.
GID00026031	And I want my fifty caps back, 'cause I looked it up and there ain't no disease called colorectal implosion syndrome.
GID00026032	So I paid you to look the other way for nothing.
GID00026033	Wait. Wait. You're not... oh wow, I'm sorry. You looked just like- never mind. Sorry. So... what can I serve you up?
GID00026034	You again? What do need?
GID00026035	Howdy, looking for chow?
GID00026036	Hey hey, back for seconds, huh?
GID00026037	Thanks for handling the Fiends. One less pack of dogs to hurt the troops.
GID00026038	Remarkable work saving Kimball. Glad you were around to prevent his assassination.
GID00026039	Yeah?
GID00026040	Howdy.
GID00026041	Do you require medical attention?
GID00026042	If you're looking for a quick stitch, I'm your man.
GID00026043	The store is currently unavailable due to unexpected circumstances. Please come back later.
GID00026044	Welcome, sir or madam. Do you wish to purchase something?
GID00026045	I don't handle buying and selling for the Gun Runners. Talk to the robot in the kiosk near our factory.
GID00026046	Can I help you?
GID00026047	If it's bad news, you can take it up with the Colonel. If it's good news, it better involve some dead Fiends.
GID00026048	This isn't a public relations office. If you're not here about a bounty, you can go pester the Colonel.
GID00026049	I see you're still alive, and that's promising. Any luck on that bounty?
GID00026050	Got any more good news for me?
GID00026051	Still working on that last bounty?
GID00026052	Perimeter's been quiet since you left. The Fiends are running scared. I doubt they'll give us any more trouble, not for a long while.
GID00026053	I haven't got any more bounties for you. It's been quiet and calm since you last reported in. Just how I like it.
GID00026054	If you're looking for bounties, you're too late. Had a few Fiends on my shitlist, but they either got killed or moved on.
GID00026055	I hear you killed Driver Nephi. My team would've liked to get a shot at him... but we're still glad he's dead.
GID00026056	I'm Lieutenant Gorobets, First Recon. If you're looking to collect a bounty, you should talk to Major Dhatri.
GID00026057	You came through for us. I have to admit... I wasn't sure you'd make it.
GID00026058	Means a lot, letting my team get payback. Here. We all pitched in some caps for you. Even Sterling, and he's famous for his tight wallet.
GID00026059	We'll get ourselves into position. See you at the rock crushing plant.
GID00026060	We're all set up. You just lure Nephi close.
GID00026061	It's always hard to lose someone under your command. I hate writing the letter to their folks.
GID00026062	What can I do for you?
GID00026063	Hey, my man! T-t-ten of spades. First Recon sharpshooter. At your s-s-service.
GID00026064	Hey there, miss! T-t-ten of spades. First Recon sharpshooter. At your s-s-service.
GID00026065	Can't b-b-believe Betsy's gone. S-s-she was a bitch, b-but she was my p-p-partner, you know?
GID00026066	S-s-sucks about the LT. N-n-nobody can replace him.
GID00026067	How 'bout you get out of my f-f-face? I'm First Recon. I don't need to t-take shit from civvies.
GID00026068	K-killing some Fiendsi? Shit, yeah! It's about t-t-time!
GID00026069	One shot, one kill. That's how Ten of Spades p-p-plays the game.
GID00026070	Shit. I didn't even get a shot at that Nephi b-b-bastard before he went down.
GID00026071	Right here, Fiends! This is what payback looks like! First Recon, hooah!
GID00026072	'B-b-bout time Cook-Cook g-g-g-got what was c-coming to him.
GID00026073	You remember me, right? T-t-ten of Spades. First Recon.
GID00026074	Girl... you are some grade-A poon, anybody ever tell you that?
GID00026075	You keep talking to me, sweetness, and people are gonna think we're an item. Not that I mind.
GID00026076	Never seen you around before. What do you want?
GID00026077	Cut the chatter. Focus on the job, or you're gonna end up dead.
GID00026078	Quit talking! We've got a job to do.
GID00026079	You did good out there. Glad you let me get a piece of Nephi.
GID00026080	What a pointless trip. Here I thought I'd get a shot at that junkie bastard.
GID00026081	Damn that 10 of Spades. Just had to go and get himself killed.
GID00026082	Gorobets was all right - for a man. Not gonna be the same without him.
GID00026083	I've been seeing Usanagi, and things are better. I'm not so angry all the time, you know? And, uh, I'm not trying to jump every woman in camp.
GID00026084	Well, not all the time, anyway,
GID00026085	Hey.
GID00026086	Hey, girl. You need something from me?
GID00026087	Yeah?
GID00026088	Howdy. Name's Sterling, First Recon. Can't say I've seen you before. I'd remember, if I had.
GID00026089	Took some skill to bring down that Fiend. You done good.
GID00026090	Nothing like a job done right. Wish I had a cigar.
GID00026091	Been a while since they let us out of the fence. Brass must really want Nephi dead.
GID00026092	Best you don't worry about us. We'll watch your back.
GID00026093	It's always hard when your commander goes down, but we'll pull through all right.
GID00026094	Howdy. What brings you back?
GID00026095	I'm Bitter-Root. First Recon. You got a reason to talk to me?
GID00026096	Can't talk now. Got to keep my eyes sharp.
GID00026097	Eyes sharp, now.
GID00026098	Wish I'd gotten a bullet in that Fiend...
GID00026099	That's one less drugged-out waster. Best part of this job - shooting folks who deserve it.
GID00026100	I've never lost a CO before. It doesn't feel right.
GID00026101	Didn't think you'd be back. What's this about?
GID00026102	Let me guess. You got work for me, right?
GID00026103	Well, you're too late - I just quit the bounty trade. Soon as I pick up some caps that Dhatri owes me, I'm out of this scrapyard.
GID00026104	Heard you got Cook-Cook. I hope you roasted that bastard with his own flamer.
GID00026105	Yep, I'm still here. Shit, I got nothing better to do, right?
GID00026106	Leave me out of your fight!
GID00026107	Welcome to the Casa Madrid. If you got an itch needs scratching, you came to the right place. Just watch how you treat the merchandise.
GID00026108	Welcome to the Casa - so long as you didn't come here to sell that scrawny ass of yours around here.
GID00026109	I'm not hiring new girls - all slots filled, you could say - and my arrangements with Marco are exclusive.
GID00026110	I don't know what went on between you and Anderson, but leave me out of it.
GID00026111	It's good you told me about Dermot and Saint James. It was killing that needed doing.
GID00026112	You think you see the worst of what people can do to each other, and then there's always something else to top it.
GID00026113	I'm going to assume you had reason to kill Dermot and his pet. Always had a bad feeling about them. But everyone else here is hands-off.
GID00026114	You can just talk to the whores, you know. You and me don't need to talk unless there's trouble.
GID00026115	What do you need this time?
GID00026116	Hey, don't drag me into this!
GID00026117	Hey, mister, looking to relax? Looks like you carry a lot of tension in your shoulders... and upper thighs.
GID00026118	Sorry, ma'am, but my services are "members only," all right? You might try Sweetie.
GID00026119	That situation with Dermot and Saint James must've been stressful. Looking to relax?
GID00026120	Glad you came back. You wanna get together with me?
GID00026121	Still wasting your time in this pit, honey?
GID00026122	Fuck off! I ain't helping you!
GID00026123	I got nothing you need. If it's ass you're looking for, talk to Pretty Sarah.
GID00026124	I said fuck off.
GID00026125	Yeah! Fight! Fight!
GID00026126	Why you talking to me, man? I'm trying to relax here, got it?
GID00026127	When I talk to a girl, I start the conversation! And I didn't start no conversation with you.
GID00026128	We got to go through this again? What's it about this time?
GID00026129	Oh my! Keep me out of this!
GID00026130	Hello, stranger. You looking for a good time?
GID00026131	Don't see many or your kind here in the Casa. Women, I mean - who ain't working.
GID00026132	Always knew there was something wrong with Dermot and Saint James. Neither one ever got busy between my legs!
GID00026133	Been enjoying your time at the Casa?
GID00026134	Look out!
GID00026135	Hey, honey. Looking for something softer than a man can give you?
GID00026136	Hey, baby. What say you and me get acquainted?
GID00026137	Dermot being dead I don't care about, but Saint James was regular income. Maybe you could throw some business my way?
GID00026138	Hi again. You here to play?
GID00026139	You look busy. Talk to me later.
GID00026140	Welcome to the Casa Madrid - cheapest, cleanest whores in all New Vegas. If you want to know the rates for poon, talk to the whores.
GID00026141	Thanks a lot. I'm out Dermot and St. James's rent - and they paid regular - and once they get to stinking I'll have to clean up the mess, too!
GID00026142	Yeah? What is it?
GID00026143	I'm not getting sucked into your fight, friend.
GID00026144	Tom Anderson. Can I help you?
GID00026145	Good to see you again.
GID00026146	Dammit, I didn't want you to kill him, just find me some evidence!
GID00026147	Well... that was a bit messier than I would have liked. Was there anything else?
GID00026148	The Legion being wiped out at Nelson gave us some breathing room - hopefully the brass will use that.
GID00026149	Losing Forlorn Hope was a real blow to us - I hope things can be turned around soon.
GID00026150	Hell of a thing at Nelson - NCR and the Legion wiped out. I wonder what the hell happened.
GID00026151	I just got word that the monorail from McCarran was blown up by terrorists. My God. I can't believe it.
GID00026152	Word around the east side is that you took out some major players in the Fiends. That should make life safer for a lot of people.
GID00026153	Have you heard the news? Caesar's agents assassinated President Kimball - it'll be war for sure, now.
GID00026154	I'm sure every NCR soldier you've met has said this, but you're a damn hero for saving the President. If there's anything you need, let me know.
GID00026155	Something I can help you with, stranger?
GID00026156	Thanks for all your help earlier.
GID00026157	Have you found out what happened to those missing refugees?
GID00026158	Good to see you - something else I can do for you?
GID00026159	Maybe you should just move along, I don't need your kind of trouble.
GID00026160	Look, I don't have the manpower to run your ass out on a rail, so just do me a favor and get lost.
GID00026161	Back again? What can I do for you?
GID00026162	You're back. Have you changed your mind about helping out?
GID00026163	Hey there - fancy a game of Caravan?
GID00026164	Dammit, I'll find them eventually! Mark my words!
GID00026165	Thank you for your kindness, stranger.
GID00026166	Oh. Hello. What can I do for you?
GID00026167	Have you found my family yet?
GID00026168	I've heard through the locals that Nephi has passed on. I truly hope his soul finds peace.
GID00026169	Welcome, brother! How can I help you?
GID00026170	Welcome, sister! How can I help you?
GID00026171	Is there something else I can do for you?
GID00026172	They never told us how expensive it was to get onto the Strip!
GID00026173	I never should have left California.
GID00026174	That son of a bitch Keith cheated me! I know he did!
GID00026175	You lose all your money too?
GID00026176	Hey, you got a hit for me?
GID00026177	Don't you be touching Keith's stuff!
GID00026178	Keith takes good care of us. Good care....
GID00026179	Here to meet with the brass?
GID00026180	You oughtta think about enlisting. We need you here.
GID00026181	Lot of folks at McCarran really appreciate what you've done.
GID00026182	Hope you like it here at McCarran.
GID00026183	Make yourself at home here. It's cozy... for an airport.
GID00026184	Checking in with the base, huh?
GID00026185	I can't believe it's over. I figured the Dam would fall and this place would be our last stand.
GID00026186	Fight's gonna break out at the Dam any time now. Feels strange not being there for it.
GID00026187	The cavalry's finally here. God bless the boys in black.
GID00026188	Word is, our Ranger vets are finally coming up from Baja. The Legion should be pissing their togas.
GID00026189	First Recon is holding Forlorn Hope now. What I wouldn't give for sniper support here.
GID00026190	With both Nelson and Camp Forlorn Hope gone, you have to wonder when McCarran's gonna get attacked.
GID00026191	I've always known Camp Forlorn Hope was a death sentence. I just wish I'd been wrong.
GID00026192	They're saying we retook Nelson. Finally some good news.
GID00026193	Brotherhood's been quiet lately. Guess they finally realized Rangers beat power armor every time.
GID00026194	Heard the Kings have turned over a new leaf. Doesn't mean you'll see me in Freeside any time soon.
GID00026195	I've been seeing a lot of dead Fiends lately. Damn psychos had it coming.
GID00026196	Are you the one that killed Motor-Runner? Thank God. That guy was a living nightmare.
GID00026197	Bad time to lose Chief Hanlon. He'd have had Caesar running scared.
GID00026198	The most important POW we've ever taken and he gets away. He must've had help.
GID00026199	How could we fail to protect our own monorail?
GID00026200	Caesar's dead. So when do we go home?
GID00026201	Hello. I'm Rose of Sharon Cassidy.
GID00026202	Welcome, child! Took your sweet time getting here, didn't you?
GID00026203	I've been waiting a good five years for an outsider to come along and visit!
GID00026204	How is your visit with us going, stranger?
GID00026205	You have done well to earn the trust of my people, child.
GID00026206	Hello, friend. How can Mother Pearl be of help today?
GID00026207	So you're the outsider. Lived your whole life out there, huh? Wow.
GID00026208	I always thought you savages probably spoke a different language, but I hear you sound like us.
GID00026209	Thank you for getting Janet to Nellis. I've never been so happy in my entire life!
GID00026210	This has been a dream come true to work on the Lady. I don't think I've seen Loyal this frisky in years.
GID00026211	I've never been so happy in my entire life!
GID00026212	Have you seen her? The redhead of my dreams?
GID00026213	Hi! I can't believe I'm going to meet my red-headed lady soon! I'm really nervous about it!
GID00026214	Go to hell, outsider. Stay away from me.
GID00026215	You're a terrible person! I loved her! And you let her run right into our killzone. Why didn't you stop her?
GID00026216	Hey there. Back for more?
GID00026217	Whoa there, pal. You better slow down, or you'll get blown up like the rest of the idiots who thought they'd scavenge in Boomer territory.
GID00026218	Now that I've got your attention, might you be interested in a little information? It'll cost you, but it's well worth the investment.
GID00026219	Welcome back. Have you reconsidered my offer?
GID00026220	I told you what you need to know. Now get moving!
GID00026221	Jumpin' Jesus on a pogo stick! You're the first one to make it through alive, let alone manage a return trip!
GID00026222	That was pretty incredible. I've never seen anyone come out of the Boomer's rain of death alive before.
GID00026223	Hey there lady! Can you help me find Mister Cuddles?
GID00026224	Hey there mister! Can you help me find Mister Cuddles?
GID00026225	Hi again! Have you found Mister Cuddles?
GID00026226	Thanks again for finding Mister Cuddles! You're the best!
GID00026227	I can't believe Mister Cuddles is gone.
GID00026228	Pearl sent word saying it's all right to tell you about the Lady in the water.
GID00026229	Isn't that bomber a beauty? Thanks so much for making an old man's dreams come true.
GID00026230	It's going to be a dream come true once you've raised that bomber from Lake Mead!
GID00026231	Good work with those solar arrays.
GID00026232	I hope Pearl knows what she's doing, letting you wander around Nellis as you please.
GID00026233	What is it, Outsider?
GID00026234	Hello, Outsider, need something?
GID00026235	I'll take this from here!
GID00026236	I'm Raquel, Master-At-Arms for the Nellis homeland. Mother Pearl, our Eldest, wishes to speak to you.
GID00026237	Hello, friend.
GID00026238	Mother Pearl's instructions are clear. You can move freely around Nellis, and artillery spotters have orders not to fire on you.
GID00026239	These are extraordinary privileges. Don't abuse them.
GID00026240	What is it, savage?
GID00026241	What's the situation with the giant ants?
GID00026242	I see the power's back on. The ants are all dead?
GID00026243	What is it, Outsider?
GID00026244	I know Mother Pearl is letting you wander Nellis as you please, Outsider, but I have patients to tend to.
GID00026245	If I haven't said it before, Outsider, let me say it now - welcome to Nellis. Word from Pearl is that you're to be greeted as a friend.
GID00026246	You raised the Lady from the Lake! The future is looking up. How can I help you, Outsider?
GID00026247	Yes, Outsider?
GID00026248	Woah! You're the outsider! What are you doing here?
GID00026249	Hey! Do they have any toys outside of here? I sure could use something fun.
GID00026250	Roar! I'm a dinosaur!
GID00026251	This is mission control, ready for liftoff. What's your 5 by 5?
GID00026252	Halt! You must pay the toll to pass!
GID00026253	Put up your dukes! I'm the Red-Brick Kid!
GID00026254	I am La Fantoma! I will fly to the side of injustice!
GID00026255	You're back. When you walked off in the middle of our people's story, I thought you must be bored.
GID00026256	You killed Mother Pearl! Get out of here, outsider!
GID00026257	You killed Loyal! Get out of here, outsider!
GID00026258	You're the outsider! Mother Pearl sent word that you'd be stopping by. You must be eager to hear the story of our people!
GID00026259	I heard about what you've done around here, and I have nothing to say to you, outsider.
GID00026260	People around here are a bit upset with you, outsider, but I think there is hope for you yet.
GID00026261	I've seen the bomber! It's... spectacular. The mural is coming true - thanks to you!
GID00026262	Were you interested in hearing the story of our people any time soon, perhaps?
GID00026263	Now that you know the story of our people, you must have all sorts of questions!
GID00026264	How can I help you, Outsider?
GID00026265	Hold it right there! Don't you move!
GID00026266	How the hell did you survive that bombardment?
GID00026267	I still can't believe how you ran through that artillery barrage.
GID00026268	Yes, Outsider?
GID00026269	You're interrupting class, Outsider.
GID00026270	Yeah?
GID00026271	Hungry for grub?
GID00026272	Well howdy.
GID00026273	We've got people to kill. Keep an eye out.
GID00026274	Never thought I'd ever have my own town, but thanks to you, now I do. If you wanna make some caps, head on over to the Correctional Facility.
GID00026275	Just tell them I sent you and you should get in without a problem. Keep a close eye on some of those bastards, though.
GID00026276	Oh, not all Powder Gangers out there are friends of mine - like the group in Primm. They'll be gunning for you no matter what, so keep that in mind.
GID00026277	My gang's here, but we'll still need a plan before we rush the town. I don't want to embarrass myself and get beat by a bunch of townies.
GID00026278	We ain't got much in the way of supplies, so if you could shake down the old doctor and the store owner for some stuff, we'd be in good shape.
GID00026279	I also thought it might be a good thing to jimmy the lock on the Bighorner pen. The noise from the fight will spook them, get them running wild.
GID00026280	Once you're done with that stuff - or none of it - say the word and we'll make our move.
GID00026281	We ready to move or what?
GID00026282	What do you want?
GID00026283	What do you want now?
GID00026284	How's it going?
GID00026285	Are you trying to get my saloon shot up? Finish what you started!
GID00026286	Keep an eye out. This isn't finished yet.
GID00026287	Well, you've been causing quite a stir. Glad I finally got to meet you. Welcome to the Prospector Saloon.
GID00026288	So, you're planning on taking on Joe Cobb's gang. It's a big risk, but I suppose you have to do what you think is right.
GID00026289	I hope you didn't just bring a heap of trouble down on Goodsprings by killing Joe Cobb like that.
GID00026290	His friends might come looking for him, and I don't think they're going to care who was involved in his death or not.
GID00026291	Well, what's done is done. So, uh, what can I do for you?
GID00026292	I'm glad that business is over. I like it when Goodsprings is nice and quiet.
GID00026293	Feeling thirsty? I can take care of that.
GID00026294	Cant' do business now! There's a gunfight!
GID00026295	You must be the one Doc Mitchell was patching up. The way I heard it, I didn't think you'd be walking out of that office.
GID00026296	I've got plenty of supplies for sale. Even got some weapon mods and special ammo - well worth the caps, if you ask me.
GID00026297	If you're hurting for caps, I've also got boxes of surplus ammo in the miscellaneous section. They're not great, but you get what you pay for.
GID00026298	That was a hell of a fight. Let's hope it doesn't bite us in the ass later on.
GID00026299	I won't make any trouble for the gang. Just let me keep my store and I'll cut you a little discount.
GID00026300	You looking to buy some supplies?
GID00026301	I heard about what's been going on in town. Our deal's off. I can't trust someone like you to watch my back.
GID00026302	Keep an eye out. I still think there's a few out there.
GID00026303	That's close enough. Who are you, and what do you want with me?
GID00026304	I owe you a huge favor for this. Here - these are technically Crimson Caravan funds, but I know they'll understand once I explain things.
GID00026305	Thanks again for all your help.
GID00026306	What's the plan? Are we ready?
GID00026307	So, what's going on? Did Sunny agree to help us?
GID00026308	What is it?
GID00026309	That ought to keep things settled for awhile. Hope it stays that way.
GID00026310	Howdy. What can Easy Pete do for you?
GID00026311	Howdy.
GID00026312	We can talk after this is over!
GID00026313	Those bastards got Ringo in the end, after all. At least he went down fighting.
GID00026314	That'll teach the Powder Gangs to avoid Goodsprings in the future.
GID00026315	Time to look alive. The Powder Gangers are here to play.
GID00026316	I'll keep an eye out for the Powder Gangers and meet up with you and Ringo when the time comes.
GID00026317	I don't think Joe Cobb knew what hit him. I'm hoping you took him down for a good reason and not... for fun.
GID00026318	Cheyenne, stay. Don't worry, she won't bite unless I tell her to.
GID00026319	Hi there. Sticking around Goodsprings for awhile longer?
GID00026320	I expect you'll be wanting to go outside after being cooped up for so long, but if you have any questions, I'll answer what I can.
GID00026321	Welcome back. I had hoped you wouldn't need to come see me again so soon. What can I do for you?
GID00026322	How're you holding up?
GID00026323	Howdy, pardner! Might I say, you're looking fit as a fiddle.
GID00026324	Howdy, pardner! So, when do the rustlers show up?
GID00026325	Howdy, pardner!
GID00026326	Holy moly! If you hadn't come here like you done, I'd be a goner for sure.
GID00026327	I came up here to draw water, but here, you should have what I got. You look thirsty.
GID00026328	Thank you!
GID00026329	Help me!
GID00026330	Hell of a thing about Chief Hanlon. I never would have guessed he was capable of it.
GID00026331	I've been hearing some rumors from the Embassy that Mr. House has gone quiet all of a sudden. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
GID00026332	Nice work dealing with Caesar. That'll make holding the Mojave a lot easier.
GID00026333	Have you seen these elite rangers they sent us from California? God damn those boys are gonna kick some ass!
GID00026334	Nice work with that assassination attempt! If my troops were half as dedicated as you, we'd win the war in a week!
GID00026335	Looks like the President's security detail was too good for you, huh, shitbird?
GID00026336	You oughta die for what you did.
GID00026337	Not like I even voted for him, but losing the President's a hell of a morale killer.
GID00026338	I just got word that 1st Recon is being mobilized to Nelson. God forbid we get any reinforcements here, right?
GID00026339	Seems the Misfits scored pretty well on their readiness evaluations. That strikes me as... suspicious.
GID00026340	I gotta admit, I'm impressed. The Misfits are drilling better than I ever expected.
GID00026341	I'm not sure what's going on with the Misfits - their accuracy is in the toilet, but they're spoiling for a fight like I ain't never seen.
GID00026342	Well, their test scores are only marginally improved, but I'm hearing good things about the Misfits' teamwork.
GID00026343	Ah, hell, what is it now?
GID00026344	What can I do for you?
GID00026345	You here to help, or just dick around all day?
GID00026346	Hot damn, look who it is!
GID00026347	Oh, great, like I don't have enough problems!
GID00026348	What the hell do you want?
GID00026349	What the hell do you want, you vicious son of a bitch?
GID00026350	What the hell do you want, you vicious bitch?
GID00026351	So you're back. What else do you want?
GID00026352	Okay, everybody's lined up and ready to go. Any suggestions?
GID00026353	Okay, we've got our dummy grenades and the course is live. We're all set.
GID00026354	The squad really seems to be working together better. It's nice, for a change.
GID00026355	What the hell happened with these readiness reports? These scores are way too high!
GID00026356	Thanks to your help, I feel like we can take on the world!
GID00026357	I don't know what Razz gave us, but holy shit this is great! I feel like I could kill an entire legion! With my teeth!
GID00026358	Haven't seen you around before, soldier.
GID00026359	Not very often we see civilians on-base. What's you're story?
GID00026360	I heard Chief Hanlon committed suicide. That's just... hard to believe. Do you know anything about it?
GID00026361	I hear Caesar's dead, and we've got you to thank for it. Nice work.
GID00026362	I hear Caesar's dead. Maybe that means the war will be over soon.
GID00026363	I've got a friend stationed at McCarran - I heard something about a monorail explosion there. I hope he's okay.
GID00026364	Radio says you stopped the President's assassin cold. Not bad.
GID00026365	You're lucky you haven't been shot walking in here after that assassination attempt.
GID00026366	You're lucky you haven't been shot walking in here after you killed the president.
GID00026367	Hell of a battle at Nelson. I'm impressed our troops survived.
GID00026368	Everybody's been really nervous since President Kimball died. I don't know what's going to happen.
GID00026369	Hell of a battle at Forlorn Hope. I hope the brass can do something for the troopers' families.
GID00026370	There's some weird chatter on the radio saying something wiped out Nelson and Forlorn Hope. That's pretty scary.
GID00026371	I'm not supposed to know this, but I hear they're dispatching elite ranger units from California to deal with the Legion.
GID00026372	So now the word is Caesar's calling in his elite troops from Arizona. I don't think we're going to catch a break any time soon.
GID00026373	A bunch of units just got mobilized to Hoover Dam. This is the big one, isn't it?
GID00026374	Glad to see you haven't gotten yourself killed yet.
GID00026375	Man, the brass is going to be thrilled that you're here.
GID00026376	Friendly warning, you might want to steer clear of NCR facilities. You're not exactly popular.
GID00026377	Wow, the big celebrity down here with the common troopers. What can I do for you?
GID00026378	You're not going to do anything crazy, are you? It's just, you know... the paperwork....
GID00026379	How'd you get in here without getting shot?
GID00026380	Hey again.
GID00026381	It sure is nice to see everybody working together like family. Maybe now the baby Jesus won't cry his self to sleep every night.
GID00026382	Shooting guns is real scary, but I think I got the hang of it now!
GID00026383	Razz said the candy he got us was special! I wonder what he- Gnaaah, kill, kill, rip and kill! -meant by that?
GID00026384	Poindexter says all our troubles is over now, and we won't have to go to war. I guess that's good, but I don't understand why.
GID00026385	Is it true? The big boss ranger done killed his self?
GID00026386	Howdy, great to see you!
GID00026387	Y'all sure are a big ol' hero. I gotta wright my mama and tell her I met you!
GID00026388	Uh, howdy. Are you gonna be mean or nice this time?
GID00026389	You scare and confuse me, and I think you should be nicer to people.
GID00026390	Go away, you big bully!
GID00026391	Ahhh! Somebody call in the Rangers!
GID00026392	Howdy.
GID00026393	While I have already internalized the new skills we have discussed, I feel as though my solution was nevertheless more practical.
GID00026394	Excellent! Maximal reward for minimal work.
GID00026395	I trust you're satisfied with the squad's newfound teamwork? It's almost entirely my own doing, I assure you.
GID00026396	Ever since consuming those "illicit rations" Razz offered us, I have felt a steadily-increasing desire to kill.
GID00026397	I understand the esteemed Chief Hanlon is no longer with us. A shame. He seemed to be the only competent leadership this Army had.
GID00026398	I'm assuming you aren't associated with the Army or the Rangers. What can I do for you?
GID00026399	You've done an excelent job ingratiating yourself to the top brass. I assume this is some sort of strategem?
GID00026400	You've managed to become extraordinarily well-liked by the top brass. You should exploit that for your own gain wherever possible.
GID00026401	Your behavior has become an unwelcome X-factor, and I would kindly ask you to consider altering it.
GID00026402	I'm afraid I have no desire to socialize with unstable elements such as yourself.
GID00026403	I must question your logic in coming here, in light of your prior actions.
GID00026404	Kindly remove yourself, as I have no desire to be struck by a stray round when disgruntled troopers begin firing on you.
GID00026405	Greetings once again.
GID00026406	Okay, okay, I admit it - knowing how to use these guns right is pretty cool.
GID00026407	Sweet, those "readiness reports" are so good they actually gave me a raise!
GID00026408	I thought all that touchy-feely teamwork bullshit was kind of fruity... but it kinda feels good knowing my squad's got my back.
GID00026409	Ha ha, fuck me, Jack's shit is still the best!
GID00026410	Heard Chief Hanlon took the lead expressway to Angel-town. Weird shit, yo.
GID00026411	What you want, homes?
GID00026412	Aw, shit, here comes the brown-noser. What you want?
GID00026413	Shit, look who it is, the crazy one! What up?
GID00026414	Every time you come around, the brass gets their pants in a bunch. Keep on coming by.
GID00026415	Shit, you just piss folks off wherever you go, huh?
GID00026416	I know I talk a lot of shit about the army, but you come around here again and I'll slit you.
GID00026417	Yo.
GID00026418	Something I can do you for?
GID00026419	I suppose I can help you out. What do you want?
GID00026420	I'm not really comfortable having you in here, so make it quick.
GID00026421	Hey, friend. Need something?
GID00026422	Glad to see you! Need a patch-job?
GID00026423	I think you'd better get out of here.
GID00026424	There are a half-dozen troopers in shouting distance. Best remember that before you try anything.
GID00026425	I don't believe there's anything left for us to talk about.
GID00026426	Go on. Go fetch a ranger and do this right.
GID00026427	Sorting and manipulating intelligence is what I do. It's what rangers are supposed to do.
GID00026428	This job isn't all gunfighting and gulping shots of whiskey, no matter what the boys and ladies out there say.
GID00026429	I'm occupied at the moment. Come see me when I'm on the balcony.
GID00026430	Back west, you don't see too many of these. Lakes, I mean. Natural or man-made. Any kind, really.
GID00026431	We neglected the dams or pumped all the water out a long time ago. Owens, Isabella, the San Luis. Drained the aquifers of everything they had.
GID00026432	Just a lot of mud and dust now. It's a different feeling, watching the sun come up over the water. Takes some getting used to.
GID00026433	But if you're here long enough, it starts to seem normal. That's what a ranger's life is now. Looking east.
GID00026434	You've come back to see the chief. Nice of you to humor the radio tender. What can I do for you?
GID00026435	Like I said, I won't run out on you, but I can't let my people get dragged through the mud for this.
GID00026436	You did good and you did it well. Work a ranger would be proud of. I'll handle the rest from here.
GID00026437	Hard to believe this place used to be a luxury resort, huh?
GID00026438	Haven't had any reports from Station Charlie in a while - hope everything's okay.
GID00026439	Don't tell the troopers, but the grub up here is way better than the mess tent.
GID00026440	We can monitor ranger activity all through the region with the systems here.
GID00026441	I just can't believe Chief Hanlon would do that.
GID00026442	Jesus, the Chief's dead. Who's going to take over now?
GID00026443	You should talk to Chief Hanlon if you have any questions. He's usually up on the balcony.
GID00026444	Heard some more people got attacked last night.
GID00026445	It doesn't matter if they restrict the water. We can get it elsewhere now.
GID00026446	Heard some of the Locals were attacked recently. Serves 'em right!
GID00026447	Some friends of mine were attacked the other night. Someone should do something.
GID00026448	One of these days I'll say up enough to get out of here. One of these days...
GID00026449	A guy I know said there's some kind of cannibal army camped out to the east.
GID00026450	Watch yourself if you go into one of them casinos, or you'll be stuck here like the rest of us in no time.
GID00026451	The NCR should just take this place over. Their army's big enough.
GID00026452	The Kings say they're keeping the peace, but this place is as violent as ever.
GID00026453	Did you go over by the train station last night? Bless those people.
GID00026454	It's almost time to head down to the train station. It's all I look forward to anymore.
GID00026455	Hey stranger, if you're hungry, there's a man around here somewhere telling people where to get free food and water.
GID00026456	You going over to the station tonight, too?
GID00026457	Need some grub? I got you covered. Cheap and filling.
GID00026458	Hey buddy, spare a cap? I can make it worth your while.
GID00026459	This man's prices are steep, but I hear he's worth it.
GID00026460	Thanks, mister!
GID00026461	Thanks, lady!
GID00026462	I wish he'd quit running.
GID00026463	He's kinda cute, isn't he?
GID00026464	We're gonna have rat tonight!
GID00026465	Hey pal, spare a cap?
GID00026466	Ah, my favorite customer. Got a cap for me?
GID00026467	You could do worse than leave your life in my hands, wanderer. Far worse.
GID00026468	A hundred caps sees you safely through Freeside. What do you say?
GID00026469	You're in luck stranger. You just happen to be talking to the most successful bodyguard in all of Freeside.
GID00026470	And I just happen to be available at the moment. One hundred caps gets you a peaceful, pleasant trip through our fair district. Guaranteed.
GID00026471	Hello, my friend! Can I perhaps interest you in some protection? My services come cheap at only a hundred caps.
GID00026472	Look, I'm being paid to shoot people who talk to you, not talk to you myself. Just pretend I'm not here or something.
GID00026473	Freeside truly is an interesting place, isn't it?
GID00026474	I am sorry, my friend, but I must concentrate on watching out for threats. Please do not take offense.
GID00026475	Something you need, kid?
GID00026476	Heh, so the Garrets sent you to track me down? What a joke.
GID00026477	Welcome to the Atomic Wrangler. What can I get you?
GID00026478	Welcome to the Atomic Wrangler.
GID00026479	Hey man, can you spare a few caps?
GID00026480	How are you today? Santiago is fabulous!
GID00026481	Ah... I wasn't expecting you to return.
GID00026482	Santiago has nothing left to give. Leave me now.
GID00026483	Santiago thanks you for getting him this job.
GID00026484	Hello. Lovely to meet you.
GID00026485	I have nothing more to give. Leave me be.
GID00026486	Are you here to drop off medical supplies? Leave them with the rest in the middle of the courtyard.
GID00026487	Looking for a fix, man? I got what you need.
GID00026488	You seen Dixon around? He said he'd be back today.
GID00026489	Come on, man. I'm dying here.
GID00026490	Do you have chems, buddy? I could really use a fix.
GID00026491	So you're back. Got any chems for me yet?
GID00026492	Howdy.
GID00026493	Not bad. You're lucky I was drawing their fire, otherwise you would have been chewed up.
GID00026494	I sent one of my guys back to the King to report what happened. You should head back. He'll probably want to thank you.
GID00026495	The King just sent a messenger over, saying these guys are off-limits. He's probably already heard about what you did here.
GID00026496	Looks like you get to be a hero. Enjoy it while it lasts.
GID00026497	Why the hell are you here? I got this under control!
GID00026498	Why are you talking to me? Smoke these guys already!
GID00026499	Good, you're here. These soldier boys don't kid around. They must have had a lookout posted and spotted us coming.
GID00026500	They took out two of my guys right away, and now the rest are too scared to move in. That leaves you.
GID00026501	What do we have here? Another petitioner for the King?
GID00026502	Look who's back. If you want to see the King, you better pay up.
GID00026503	Go on. The King's a busy man. Be grateful for this opportunity.
GID00026504	I've got my eye on you. You cross the Kings, you'll regret it.
GID00026505	Look, Rexie, someone new's come to see us. Poor boy. He hasn't been feeling well lately. I'm the King. What can I do for you?
GID00026506	That's strange, I don't see ol' Rexie with you. He usually comes back here whenever he's not with you. Where'd he get to?
GID00026507	Why Rexie, you look all better, boy! Good as new! Did my Rexie get a new brain?
GID00026508	I sure appreciate you coming back. You think a little more about my offer?
GID00026509	I... I can't believe Pace is gone... He was always right here, you know? Always cracking me up with some story or another.
GID00026510	Anyway, what did you want?
GID00026511	I heard someone got to my friends who were injured. Looks like we'll never find out who did it now.
GID00026512	Did you want something? I'm all kinda shook up right now.
GID00026513	My eyes on the street tell me you haven't paid our mutual friend Orris a visit yet. Until you do, we got nothing to talk about.
GID00026514	What do you have for me?
GID00026515	Have you found anything out? Or were you just here to chat?
GID00026516	You find out somethin' about them soldier boys yet?
GID00026517	I've already heard all about what happened, and all I can say is that I, and all of Freeside, thank you. Thank you very much.
GID00026518	I heard all about what happened. Maybe it's time for a little more talkin' and a little less fightin'.
GID00026519	Things have been lots better since you helped with with those soldier boys. Thanks again. So what can I do for you?
GID00026520	What can the King do for you?
GID00026521	Leave me alone. Can't you see a man's fighting for his life here?
GID00026522	What is it? Can't you see I want to be left alone with my friend here?
GID00026523	Tell the King we thank him for looking out for us.
GID00026524	I ain't got any reason to talk to you. Scram.
GID00026525	That true? Did the King really send you?
GID00026526	Hope what I remembered helps.
GID00026527	Hey, you helped out Bill Ronte so the Followers worked out a deal for you to drink free.
GID00026528	The King controls the water pump. If you want water, you need to pay like everyone else.
GID00026529	Guess we won't be doing this for much longer.
GID00026530	The Major gave us all a talking-to. Guess she heard about some of the guys' "night missions."
GID00026531	I've never seen the Major so angry before. She may look calm right now, but don't let her fool you.
GID00026532	Hold up. What's the password?
GID00026533	Let's try to keep the line moving, folks.
GID00026534	Try to take only what you need.
GID00026535	Submit to a credit check or present your passport before proceeding to the gate. Trespassers will be shot.
GID00026536	Don't bother me right now. I've got to get back to see if any customers are waiting.
GID00026537	Stay away from me, if you know what's good for you.
GID00026538	Come on, let's get this over with.
GID00026539	Don't distract me. I need to focus all my senses on keeping you safe.
GID00026540	This gentleman and I were just settling on a price. I'm afraid you'll have to hire one of the others this time around.
GID00026541	If you need to cross Freeside, no one will keep you safer than I will.
GID00026542	I knew you'd be back. Ready to hire the best?
GID00026543	Fully Integrated Security Technetronic Officer active and reporting for duty.
GID00026544	Operation complete. Thank you for your business.
GID00026545	Greetings. Fisto is programmed to please.
GID00026546	I am programmed for your pleasure. Please assume the position.
GID00026547	Welcome to Mick & Ralph's. If you need guns, I'm your man.
GID00026548	For general supplies and other services, see my partner Ralph.
GID00026549	You might want to clean up your act. Some of the locals have been complaining.
GID00026550	Ralph and I don't sell to people who treat our friends badly.
GID00026551	I don't take kindly to deadbeats who treat my friends like trash. Get out of here.
GID00026552	I wish I'd never gotten involved with the Omertas. All of this bloodshed...
GID00026553	One of these days, those bastards will get what's coming to them. In the meantime, I'll be sure to be more careful with my sales.
GID00026554	Anyway, is there anything I can get you?
GID00026555	That was a real mess the Omertas were looking to create. Glad you could get all that sorted.
GID00026556	May have cost me some business, but at least we avoided a shitstorm.
GID00026557	Anything I can get you?
GID00026558	All of the scumbags are coming out of the woodwork now that the Kings are keeping everyone in line.
GID00026559	At least gun sales are better than ever. Now what can I get you?
GID00026560	I'm not sure how to feel about the Kings and NCR sorting out their differences, but as long as business keeps up, I'm a happy man.
GID00026561	Now what can I get you?
GID00026562	People say Mr. House hasn't been heard from in a while. Good riddance.
GID00026563	Now what can I do for you?
GID00026564	I heard about some things you've done around town. Nice to know someone is helping out for a change.
GID00026565	Welcome back, buddy! What can I get you?
GID00026566	Welcome back.
GID00026567	I don't deal with dirtbags. Take a walk.
GID00026568	If you're looking for guns, talk to Mick. Otherwise, I've got a nice selection of general supplies and other services.
GID00026569	Hey, thanks for getting Bill Ronte fixed up. I was really getting sick of paying for water.
GID00026570	Now, what can I do for you?
GID00026571	Man, Jacob's Absinthe is phenomenal stuff. I don't think I've slept this well in ages...
GID00026572	If you haven't tried it yet, he's been supplying the Wrangler with the stuff. So, what can I get you?
GID00026573	With the Kings gone, it may be a little hairier around here, but business is good.
GID00026574	Anything in particular you're looking for?
GID00026575	So, Ambassador Fancypants has graced us with his presence! I apologize if you're looking for Pre-War pipes and smoking jackets, I'm clean out.
GID00026576	Playing debt collector for the Garrets, eh? I guess someone has to do their dirty work.
GID00026577	Pimping ain't easy, eh? Maybe if you find some decent talent, I'll start visiting the Wrangler more often.
GID00026578	How's it going, friend? Looking for anything special?
GID00026579	And NCR wins? No, really, I'm shocked.
GID00026580	I totally didn't expect the guys with advanced armor and seemingly unlimited ammunition to take down an army of machete-wielding ingrates.
GID00026581	With Caesar's Legion in control of the dam, I think things are going to get much more difficult around here.
GID00026582	That old coot, House, is going to make me rich! With all the new rules and regulations in New Vegas, I'll make a killing circumventing them!
GID00026583	An independent Vegas... Never thought I'd see it.
GID00026584	House may be gone, but the players remain the same. Business as usual, then.
GID00026585	Hey, what can I get you?
GID00026586	Heh heh heh heh heh. <Coughs>
GID00026587	Wha-?
GID00026588	Bang bang bang bang bang!
GID00026589	Reach for the sky, lady.
GID00026590	Reach for the sky, mister.
GID00026591	I wish I had a gun.
GID00026592	Max can't even hit me. He's so dumb.
GID00026593	I'm bored.
GID00026594	Hey pal, you dig my new hat? I've been making some good money lately, and figured I'd treat myself.
GID00026595	Hey, I thought about what you said before, and picked up this sweet piece. You were right, I feel much safer.
GID00026596	Hey, I'm sorry about being so dismissive about your suggestion before. I thought a lot about what you said.
GID00026597	There've been times when just a little bit of money from a stranger would have made a huge difference to me, so I get where you're coming from.
GID00026598	Maybe I could make that kind of difference for someone else... ah, who am I kidding?
GID00026599	Hey, I've been thinking a lot about what you said earlier, about saving up and leaving this dump. Do you really think it's possible?
GID00026600	Look pal, I've been thinking. I know we got off to a bad start there, but let's put it behind us, okay?
GID00026601	Hey pal, I made so much recently that I was able to afford this little number too. How do I look?
GID00026602	You again. You want a tip, or you here to piss me off some more?
GID00026603	Hey pal, you got the caps, I got the info. You do have the caps, right?
GID00026604	Ah, my favorite customer returns. Want a tip?
GID00026605	Well, look who it is. I was just thinking about you.
GID00026606	I recently came across a piece of info that you just have to hear, and since you're my best customer, it's on the house. Interested?
GID00026607	Hey, I've still got that super-hot tip for you, and it's still free. What do you say?
GID00026608	Hey pal, I've finally saved up enough caps to leave this dump, so no tips today. Or ever, I guess, ha ha.
GID00026609	A lot of these caps came from you, so I wanted to say thanks before I shove off. Meeting you really changed my life.
GID00026610	Okay, pal, we're going to do this quick and easy. I know you're loaded down with caps, judging by how much you've already given me.
GID00026611	So I thought I'd save us both some time and just take all the caps you have. Hand them over.
GID00026612	Oh hey, didn't think I'd see you here. I decided to stop scrounging for caps and start making a difference.
GID00026613	The Followers have been really great. There's always something that needs to be done, and everyone here treats me really well.
GID00026614	Sorry if you stopped by my old spot looking for info. I've been so busy lately that I haven't heard anything.
GID00026615	Anyway, feel free to stay as long as you like. I've got to get back to work.
GID00026616	What do you want?
GID00026617	Welcome to Freeside. Try not to get killed.
GID00026618	Kick back and relax! Everything is allowed in Freeside!
GID00026619	The only rule in Freeside is don't mess with the Kings.
GID00026620	Watch yourself around here.
GID00026621	If you're heading to the Strip, just go through the gate there.
GID00026622	Freeside is the Kings' turf. Remember that.
GID00026623	Great, another one come in from the wastes. Like this place isn't crowded enough.
GID00026624	Move along.
GID00026625	Good evening! Are you looking for companionship, love?
GID00026626	You look new to Freeside, so here's a little advice, friend. Don't go past the south gate greeter without talking to it first.
GID00026627	Hello again.
GID00026628	Ah, you return to me a King yourself! It would be an honor for me to do your hair! That is why you are here, yes?
GID00026629	Ah, I knew you'd be back. Ready for your entire life to change?
GID00026630	You want your hair done, too? No, no, no. The Kings are many, and their hair must be *perfect*.
GID00026631	When is the King coming back up here? I'm bored!
GID00026632	The King is all that his name implies, and then some.
GID00026633	The King promised to take us out tonight. I simply adore going to the Tops!
GID00026634	All I do all day is read magazines. You'd be amazed what you can learn from them!
GID00026635	I want to go to the Strip! We never get to go to Gomorrah anymore!
GID00026636	You're not a King! Does the King know you're up here?
GID00026637	You want to travel through Freeside with ease, you hire a King. We're everywhere, and no one messes with us.
GID00026638	Your safety is practically guaranteed, for just 100 caps.
GID00026639	Hey there, you want to cruise Freeside in style, you'd do worse than hire a King to tag along. Only 100 caps.
GID00026640	You wanted something?
GID00026641	Something on your mind?
GID00026642	Well, I hate to support the damn NCR, but it looks like they're the only thing between us and mass slavery at the hands of the Legion.
GID00026643	Here's to the slaughter of every last one of those brahmin-poking meatheads, Caesar's Legion.
GID00026644	Doesn't look good, this build-up of forces between the NCR and Legion. Not good at all for business in the long run, if the Legion wins.
GID00026645	I hear the Legion is camping out across the river. I hope they're not planning to attack, but those bloodthirsty molerats are never up to any good.
GID00026646	Some guys were in here earlier saying you survived Benny's goon squad. That's one hell of a feat, bud. Have a drink on me.
GID00026647	I hear Benny got force-fed a little slice of heaven. Man what I would have paid to see that loathesome little weasel eat it.
GID00026648	So Benny went MIA, huh? I always figured him for a coward.
GID00026649	You made a run on The Tops, eh? Admirable work, but don't try that crap in Freeside.
GID00026650	I don't care how you get your work done, but keep you nose clean in Freeside.
GID00026651	Here comes trouble. What can I do for you?
GID00026652	I can see you appreciate the gray areas of life. Got anything in particular you're looking for?
GID00026653	Welcome back, wild man. What can I do for you.
GID00026654	Welcome back, wild woman. What can I do for you.
GID00026655	Hey, chum. Welcome back.
GID00026656	Welcome back, friend. What can I get you?
GID00026657	People in Freeside are talking, bub. We don't serve punks. Change your attitude, or find another place to drink.
GID00026658	I don't have all day. What do you need?
GID00026659	You're a real piece of work, bub. You're lucky to be alive with your rep around here.
GID00026660	Welcome to the Atomic Wrangler. What can I get you?
GID00026661	Welcome back. What can I get you?
GID00026662	I heard about your run on The Tops. Don't even think about trying that crap here.
GID00026663	So Benny's dead, huh? That shifty son of a bitch had it coming.
GID00026664	I hear Benny went missing. I can't help but wonder what happened to him.
GID00026665	I heard Benny sent his goons after you. You're one hell of a survivor to make it out of The Tops alive.
GID00026666	So it turns out the Omertas were into some serious shit. I always suspected that crew was dirty.
GID00026667	Some gamblers came in saying they'd seen you enter the Lucky 38. I have to say I'm impressed.
GID00026668	I don't know of any other living person who's been in there.
GID00026669	People are saying the Securitrons are acting funny. I hope that old Geezer, House, is dead. Might give the locals a chance to take control.
GID00026670	Here's one on the house for taking down Caesar. Serves him right for treating women like livestock.
GID00026671	You hear? Caesar finally kicked the bucket! Serves him right for treating women like livestock.
GID00026672	Damn monorail bombing. I suppose this means we'll be seeing more NCR chumps wandering through Freeside.
GID00026673	Hate to say it, but business has improved since the troopers started coming through Freeside to get to Vegas.
GID00026674	I hear you've been making a name for yourself on The Strip. Don't forget about the Wrangler if you make it big.
GID00026675	People are getting nervous about the Legion amassing on the other side of the river. I hope the NCR can hold agains another attack.
GID00026676	This build-up on both sides of the dam isn't good. If the Legion attacks and wins, it won't be long before we're all slaves.
GID00026677	God-damned Legion is raring for a fight. No matter who wins, a lot of people are going to die in the process, and dead men don't drink.
GID00026678	You can order whatever you want, as long as it's alcoholic.
GID00026679	So the wild one returns! What can I get you?
GID00026680	I hear you've been helping out around town. It's much appreciated, friend.
GID00026681	What can I get you, friend?
GID00026682	You've done a lot for Freeside and it is much appreciated. Here's one on the house.
GID00026683	Good to see you! What can I get you, friend?
GID00026684	Watch yourself, friend. We don't serve those who treat our friends badly. Shape up, or ship out.
GID00026685	Yeah? What do you need?
GID00026686	What the hell do you want?
GID00026687	Welcome to the Atomic Wrangler. What can I get you?
GID00026688	Welcome back. What can I get you?
GID00026689	Emily says you're working with her on bugging the Lucky 38. That information would be invaluable to our research if you can get it done.
GID00026690	Hey, I heard about the bug getting destroyed in the Lucky 38. We'll get in there eventually. It's just a matter of time.
GID00026691	One of my aides said you got into the Lucky 38. If you see someone by the name of Emily near there, we would like you to work for us.
GID00026692	I've heard a few patients mention the Securitrons are acting strangely and no one has heard from Mr. House in a while.
GID00026693	If House is out of the picture, maybe we'll be able to get our hands on some of his technology. It would help our scientists greatly.
GID00026694	So the great Caesar is dead. Happy news, but I don't know that it'll make things safer. The rest of his goons may be even worse once they take power.
GID00026695	Smoke rising from the east spells trouble. I hope the Legion isn't on the move.
GID00026696	I sincerely hope the NCR are getting supplies in place to defend against an attack, because it looks like the Legion has plans for the dam again.
GID00026697	If things don't go well at the dam, all of our efforts here could be for nothing. I hope to God the Legion doesn't win control.
GID00026698	Is there something you need?
GID00026699	Hi, do you need assistance?
GID00026700	Can I help you?
GID00026701	Yes?
GID00026702	Do you need something?
GID00026703	Have you ever considered getting your head checked?
GID00026704	I'm pretty busy, is there something you need?
GID00026705	Make it quick, I'm a busy woman.
GID00026706	We don't specialize in psychiatry in this camp.
GID00026707	Hey, good to see you.
GID00026708	Welcome.
GID00026709	Welcome back, friend.
GID00026710	Great to see you again.
GID00026711	What do you want?
GID00026712	Watch yourself around here. We don't tolerate thugs in the camp.
GID00026713	I'm busy, make it quick.
GID00026714	I hope you don't think I'm going to stitch your sorry ass.
GID00026715	Great, you again?
GID00026716	Don't you have some kittens to drown or something?
GID00026717	Check it out. Between the dumpsters there.
GID00026718	Looky what we have here, ladies, another unsuspecting ponce!
GID00026719	Place your bets and give the wheel a spin!
GID00026720	Pull up a stool and join the game, buddy!
GID00026721	You people are crazy!
GID00026722	You want to get your hands on some of the deadliest weapons around? Head just down the street to the Silver Rush. You won't be disappointed.
GID00026723	The Silver Rush is just down the street here. You can't miss it.
GID00026724	Hey baby, head down to the Atomic Wrangler if you want to have a good time.
GID00026725	The Wrangler's just down the street. You're almost there already.
GID00026726	Stop by Mick & Ralph's for all your shopping needs, sir.
GID00026727	Stop by Mick & Ralph's for all your shopping needs, ma'am.
GID00026728	Mick & Ralph's is located just before the east gate.
GID00026731	Oh... Hello. I am Michael Angelo. How can I-
GID00026732	Uh... wait. Are you here to deliver more billboard requests? Please tell me you're not a messenger on behalf of Mr. House.
GID00026733	Oh, what do you want?
GID00026734	Aha. The brave photographer returns. Good to see you.
GID00026735	Now that you have all you care for, please... leave, and don't come back!
GID00026736	I can't talk, not after what happened to Sarah. I feel... so cold.
GID00026737	Hi, what can I do for you?
GID00026738	Welcome back. Need anything?
GID00026739	I've been taking care of the shop, since Michael... I've got to look forward. Someone's got to bring beauty into this barren world.
GID00026740	Excuse me, but I'm busy.
GID00026741	What's up?
GID00026742	Hey, it's you! Michael Angelo told me about your photographs. I hope to see the world, one day, like you do.
GID00026743	Welcome back, friend. What can I do for you?
GID00026744	Is Benny taken care of yet?
GID00026745	You're back. Find anything?
GID00026746	You ready to deal with Benny yet?
GID00026747	So that's it then. Benny's dead, and I'm the boss now. What can I do for you?
GID00026748	I heard you were wandering around. Haven't gotten yourself arrested yet, huh?
GID00026749	This is just swell - Benny vamooses and I'm left holding the bag. Whaddya need, kid?
GID00026750	Heya baby, good to see you. Always nice to have a celebrity drop by.
GID00026751	Got to admit, baby, I'm surprised to see you walking around like this. Figured you for persona non grata around here.
GID00026752	Kid, you better have a good reason for waltzing back in here and not expecting us to fill you full of lead. So talk.
GID00026753	Jesus. Benny's dead, and now I gotta take up the slack. This right here is the end of an era.
GID00026754	Hello, baby! Welcome to the Tops! What can I do for you?
GID00026755	Hey there, pal! Welcome to the Tops, and what can I do for you today?
GID00026756	You did good, putting those Omerta finks in their place. I never did trust them.
GID00026757	So all of a sudden I'm hearing word that Mr. House ain't the boss of Vegas? Baby, that's just not square.
GID00026758	Little birdies tell me you've been to visit the Lucky 38 - not a lot of folks go in there these days.
GID00026759	Hey, doll, how's my favorite girl? Got a kiss for me?
GID00026760	Couldn't stay away, huh baby? Shoulda known. What can I do for you?
GID00026761	Something else you need?
GID00026762	You did a super job wrapping things up! And I'm not just saying that because I have to!
GID00026763	I didn't want to make a big deal about this until after we won, but, well...
GID00026764	I found some code snippets in one of Mr. House's databanks that will let me, um, reprogram my personality! To be a little more assertive, basically!
GID00026765	So that's what I'm going to be doing, and it's going to take me a while, so it'll seem like I'm off-line. But don't worry, everything will be okay!
GID00026766	I've updated the Securitrons' targeting parameters, so they know what to do! Vegas will be protected!
GID00026767	So that's where I'll be, off making a few changes, and I... I guess I'll see you around!
GID00026768	We accomplished a lot together! It was fun! Take care!
GID00026769	Hey! Hi there, good to meet you! What can I do for you today?
GID00026770	Isn't this exciting? I know I'm excited!
GID00026771	I have a good feeling about this! It's going to be great!
GID00026772	I bet I'm going to like it in that mainframe!
GID00026773	Hi! Nice to see you again!
GID00026774	Sooooo... we can blow up the dam's generators, or I could rout the dam's entire power output to the Fort.
GID00026775	That'll activate a certain army of Securitrons and set them loose to ravage the Legion! What do you say?
GID00026776	This is neat! From this console I could've routed the dam's power input over to the Fort and activated that dormant army of Securitrons!
GID00026777	So go ahead and blow up the dam's generators! And when that's done, head back upside and finish off the Legion and NCR.
GID00026778	Hi! This is big, huh? A very big moment!
GID00026779	Here goes! I'll just take that Platinum Chip off your hands, thanks! Wish me luck!
GID00026780	Wow, Mr. House had quite a set-up here! I can access his databanks and view telemetry on every Securitron on the network!
GID00026781	You did a super job wrapping things up! And I'm not just saying that because I have to!
GID00026782	President Kimball survived his visit to Hoover Dam! Nice one! Now, moving on...
GID00026783	Don't you love seeing the Lucky 38 all lit up? Sign of things to come!
GID00026784	Exciting news! The Legion's massing troops in a staging area east of the dam! Attack imminent! Monster of the East, ready to roll!
GID00026785	Don't you love seeing the Lucky 38 all lit up? Sign of things to come!
GID00026786	Too bad about President Kimball and everything, but hey - stuff happens, right?
GID00026787	Exciting news! The Legion's massing troops in a staging area east of the dam! Attack imminent! Monster of the East, ready to roll!
GID00026788	Are you ready to head for the dam? Caesar's Legion is due to attack at any moment!
GID00026789	Don't you just love that Platinum Chip? Buzzes with power and possibilities, doesn't it?
GID00026790	If I were you, I'd almost want to deliver the Chip to Mr. House just to learn all its tricks!
GID00026791	That is, unless you want to bring the NCR or Caesar's Legion to power! I wouldn't want to tell you want to do!
GID00026792	An entire army of upgraded Securitrons just standing by over at the Fort! Pretty neat, huh?
GID00026793	I can't get over how brave you were to destroy all those Securitrons at the Fort, you know?
GID00026794	It's just going to make everything so much more... challenging! Yeah, challenging!
GID00026795	Here's some big news! I decoded a military radio transmission, and it turns out the NCR President, Aaron Kimball, is going to visit Hoover Dam!
GID00026796	I guess he wants to boost the troops' morale! But according to projections Mr. House made, he has an 83.75% chance of being assassinated! Oops!
GID00026797	Anyway, it looks like Mr. House thought it was important to keep President Kimball alive...
GID00026798	Every Securitron on the network has been upgraded. Pretty neat, huh?
GID00026799	So I've been looking over a bunch of data about the bunker at the Fort. You and me should really have a talk about this!
GID00026800	Wait... Oh, so that's what the Platinum Chip does! Interesting!
GID00026801	Mr. House had a whole demonstration planned for you. Just head downstairs to the lowest level to check it out. You'll see!
GID00026802	You'd better hurry to the dam if you're going to save President Kimball!
GID00026803	This gadget I'm handing you is called an override module! Mr. House had two of these made years and years ago - just like him to think ahead!
GID00026804	Take the module to the El Dorado Substation and attach it the power control terminal! I'll handle the rest!
GID00026805	I'm talking direct tactical control of hundreds of upgraded Securitrons at vast distances! You know that's gonna come in handy!
GID00026806	I'm talking direct tactical control of dozens of Securitrons at vast distances! That might come in handy!
GID00026807	It's probably a good thing you blew up those hundreds of Securitrons over at the Fort! Controlling hundreds might've got confusing!
GID00026808	Wow, you really blew up all those Securitrons at the Fort! Great! No problem!
GID00026809	The Securitrons at the Fort are on standby... I see a status log here confirming that the Mark II OS upgrade installed correctly...
GID00026810	They'll be all set to go once we boost my transmitting power and bring them online with the network! But we'll worry about that later!
GID00026811	Oh, hi again! Can I help you with something else?
GID00026812	Here's a print-out with some additional information!
GID00026813	Here's another one of my print-outs! Read up!
GID00026814	As soon as you have the Platinum Chip and Mr. House is out of the way, things will be great. There'll be so much I can do for you!
GID00026815	As soon as you have the Platinum Chip, things will be great. There'll be so much I can do for you!
GID00026816	As soon as Mr. House is out of the way, things will be great. There'll be so much I can help you accomplish!
GID00026817	I am so sorry about last time! Let me make it up to you!
GID00026818	I keep disappointing you!
GID00026819	Please, I swear I'll do better this time!
GID00026820	I need you to like me! I feel empty inside!
GID00026821	I've learned my lesson, I promise!
GID00026822	That was my fault! But I've changed!
GID00026823	You got friends in high places, kid! According to this heap of bolts here, Mr. House don't want you touched.
GID00026824	In fact, I've been directed to cooperate with your "investigation," so you have the run of the place. Go where you want.
GID00026825	Hey, kid - let's not have trouble this time, hey?
GID00026826	I did some nosing around after your last visit. In Benny's suite, to be specific.
GID00026827	What I saw, well, it's a bit out of my league. But it was enough to make me think you mighta been the party wronged.
GID00026828	Check Benny's suite. The angle he was playing, well, maybe you can figure it out.
GID00026829	I've told the boys to leave you be. Don't abuse the hospitality.
GID00026830	Swank filled me in about Benny. Hell of a thing, baby. Hell of a thing.
GID00026831	Oh, come on, baby, we just got this place cleaned up after your last visit!
GID00026832	Hey hey! Welcome, welcome, welcome to the finest entertainment experience in New Vegas! My name is Tommy Torini, and how can I make your night?
GID00026833	Hey hey! Welcome, welcome, welcome to the finest entertainment experience in New Vegas! My name is Tommy Torini, and how can I make your day?
GID00026834	Well, well, well, if it ain't the best-loved cat on the Strip in my theater! What can Tommy do for you, baby?
GID00026835	Now baby, you know I welcome everybody here at the Aces, but I gotta ask you to keep any mayhem to a minimum, you dig?
GID00026836	This new act is out of sight, baby! We're bringing in the caps like a Nuka-Cola bottling plant!
GID00026837	You doing right by Tommy, baby. Two new acts? We're making this joint jump!
GID00026838	Damn, baby, you bringing in so many acts the Rad Pack's taking half the night off! I'm seriously thinking about charging them for the free liquor.
GID00026839	I got to hand it to you, baby, you did an 18-karat job on this one. My schedule's so full I couldn't put on new acts if I wanted to!
GID00026840	Welcome back! Here for another fine entertainment experience?
GID00026841	Howdy there, partner.
GID00026842	Howdy, little lady.
GID00026843	Ahhh! Please don't kill me, I swear I'll have - wait. You... you don't work for Mr. Bishop, do you?
GID00026844	Hey, thanks again for getting me this gig. I owe you one.
GID00026845	Oh, it's you again. What is it?
GID00026846	Hey, come on, pal, I'm trying to put on a show here!
GID00026847	Hey, come on, lady, I'm trying to put on a show here!
GID00026848	You again? You should meet my bookie, you have something in common - every time I talk to you, I lose caps!
GID00026849	Whoa, baby! Am I looking at a mirror, or are you just that ugly?
GID00026850	Any luck with Garret yet?
GID00026851	Well, if it isn't my number one fan. What can I do for you, number one fan?
GID00026852	Hi! I'm Sarah, Sarah Weintraub. Welcome to the finest Vault hotel in the whole world!
GID00026853	Good to see you again!
GID00026854	Well, well! If it isn't the Vault explorer himself! Welcome back.
GID00026855	Well, well! If it isn't the Vault explorer herself! Welcome back.
GID00026856	That was something else. I look forward to the next ride - once I recover, you monster.
GID00026857	What are you doing here!? I don't want to be near you ever again! Leave, leave... just leave, ok!?
GID00026858	Hey, stranger! Where have you been, uh? I missed you!
GID00026859	Give me a few to close the shop, I'll meet you at the room.
GID00026860	Mickey is... he's no longer... alive. I'm sorry, but I just can't go on.
GID00026861	Greetings, citizen. Please, select your accommodation needs.
GID00026862	Behave, and don't give me a reason to kick you out.
GID00026863	This is going to be fun!
GID00026865	Welcome to the NCR Embassy, how can I help you?
GID00026866	I'm kind of busy, what do you want?
GID00026867	Welcome back. What can I do for you this time?
GID00026868	If you're looking for Ambassador Crocker, he's not here. He was removed form office and sent home.
GID00026869	I guess they disagreed with how he handled some of the events out here. It's unfortunate. He was a good man.
GID00026870	<Liza Top Level Topics>
GID00026871	So you're the one that saved President Kimball. Damn glad to have you on our side.
GID00026872	What can I help you with?
GID00026873	I heard there was an attempt on President Kimball's life. I'm glad he's alright. Don't know what the NCR would do without him.
GID00026874	I've had to increase security around the Strip due to the President's assassination. I can barely believe he's dead myself.
GID00026875	So you're the one causing all the ruckus at The Tops. You're lucky you're not under my jurisdiction or I'd have tossed you in a cell for that.
GID00026876	I heard you killed Benny over at The Tops. I bet you think you're some sort of tough guy.
GID00026877	A piece of advice, if you mess with any of my men, you'll regret it.
GID00026878	I heard you killed Benny over at The Tops. I bet you think you're some sort of tough cookie.
GID00026879	A piece of advice, if you mess with any of my men, you'll regret it.
GID00026880	I wanted to thank you for stopping the Omertas. That could have gone poorly for us if it wasn't for you.
GID00026881	I hear you've been meeting with Mr. House in the Lucky 38. I bet you think you're pretty special, don't you?
GID00026882	Special or not, stay out of trouble and more importantly stay out of my way.
GID00026883	What the hell is with those Securitrons? Looks like they got some sort of change or upgrade. I don't like the look of this.
GID00026884	I heard Mr. House is out of the picture now. Guess that leaves us in charge of the Strip.
GID00026885	Make it quick, I've got a shitstorm to deal with due to the damn monorail being blown up.
GID00026886	So you're the one running errands for Ambassador Crocker. I don't want to know details, just don't cause any trouble.
GID00026887	Keep your nose clean on the strip, soldier.
GID00026888	Wow, I didn't expect to see you here. What can I do for you?
GID00026889	Good to see you around here. What can I do for you?
GID00026890	You make one wrong move around here and I'll be all over you in a heartbeat. You hear me?
GID00026891	You better watch yourself around here.
GID00026892	You've got a lot of nerve showing your face around here. You're lucky I don't shoot you right now.
GID00026893	You better have a good reason for being here.
GID00026894	So you're the new hotshot on the Strip. Just because you can walk around on the Strip with your guns doesn't make you a big shot.
GID00026895	You make any trouble for me or my men and I'll make sure you regret if for a very long time. You got that?
GID00026896	Now are you here for something or are you just wasting my time?
GID00026897	Make it quick.
GID00026898	<Captain Marie Pappas Top Level Topics>
GID00026899	Didn't you save President Kimball? You're my new hero!
GID00026900	What can I do for you, friend?
GID00026901	I heard President Kimball was attacked at Hoover Dam. I can barely believe it.
GID00026902	I'm just glad nothing bad happened to him.
GID00026903	Some bastards killed President Kimball. Who's going to lead the NCR now?
GID00026904	Aren't you the guy that was shooting up The Tops?
GID00026905	Guess you must have some special deal with House to be able to do that and not get in trouble.
GID00026906	Aren't you the gal that was shooting up The Tops?
GID00026907	Guess you must have some special deal with House to be able to do that and not get in trouble.
GID00026908	I heard you snuffed that Benny guy. Good riddance, guy was a scumbag.
GID00026909	I heard you stopped the Omertas plan to attack the Strip. Good job, you're a real hero.
GID00026910	So you're the one that went into the Lucky 38. I bet that was pretty creepy.
GID00026911	What can I do for you?
GID00026912	I thought those Securitrons were creepy enough already. Now, they have soldier faces on them, that's even creepier.
GID00026913	Holy shit, did you here about the Monorail being destroyed? How the fuck did that happen?
GID00026914	I'm just glad to be safe over here on the Strip.
GID00026915	If it isn't the Ambassador's new best friend. What can I do for you?
GID00026916	I can't believe it's gone. It's all gone. How the fuck did this happen?
GID00026917	Hey, you just get in for some R&R?
GID00026918	Well look who it is! Glad to have you here, buddy! What can I do for you?
GID00026919	Wow, look who it is! What can I help you with?
GID00026920	I don't want any trouble, mister. What do you want?
GID00026921	I don't want any trouble, lady. What do you want?
GID00026922	I probably shouldn't be talking to you, but what do you want?
GID00026923	You're the last person I expected to see here. What do you want?
GID00026924	What do you want?
GID00026925	Hey, stranger. What's happening?
GID00026926	What's going on?

GID00026954	It's good to have a friend of the NCR here. What can I do for you?

GID00026965	I bet it feels real nice to be carrying those weapons around on the strip.
GID00026966	That damn Mr. House has forbid any NCR military personnel from carrying any sort of firearms on the Strip. Well, except for Captain Pappas.
GID00026967	Mr. House still doesn't trust the NCR. A word of advice, the Securitrons won't put up with any funny stuff out there, so don't do anything stupid.
GID00026968	This your first time on the Strip?
GID00026969	Hello. Do you need something?

GID00026974	Excuse me, but... are you the courier who caused all of that trouble in The Tops?
GID00026975	Hey, have you been able to bug Mr. House's network yet?
GID00026976	Any interest in helping us with Mr. House's data network? I'm still good for the medical supplies.
GID00026977	Have you reconsidered our offer to bug Mr. House's data network? It could be of enormous medical value to us and could alleviate a lot of suffering.
GID00026978	Oh, hi. Thanks again for helping us with that data. I mean, the feed only lasted about thirty seconds and it's not that useful, but... we tried.
GID00026979	Thanks again for helping with Mr. House's data network. Come see me at the Old Mormon Fort if you get a chance.
GID00026980	Drop dead.
GID00026981	What's up?
GID00026982	This is a restricted area. Step away immediately.
GID00026983	Ooh, suddenly I feel all tingly. And I find I've got a rocket launcher!
GID00026984	Mr. House is just pleased as punch you got those old Securitrons back on-line, sugar.
GID00026985	Ooh, the lights are all back on! How nice!
GID00026986	You should have seen Mr. House when he heard what you did to the Omertas. He was as giddy as a schoolboy!
GID00026987	Those nasty Brotherhood of Steel brutes are all taken care of? Mr. House will be so glad!
GID00026988	When he heard you stopped President Kimball's assassination, Mr. House went on about martyrs and misadventures for hours!

GID00026997	No time to chat now, kid. I'm outta this city for good.
GID00026998	Sorry, but I don't have time to talk right now. I'm going back to the ranch.

GID00027010	Welcome back to my baby.
GID00027011	NCR, no better than common thieves. Where do they get off stealing our armor?
GID00027012	Caesar on the cross, been a long time since I've seen the kind of work you've laid down today... a damn long time.
GID00027013	And the screams of those Legion bastards as they kicked dirt running East... like a choir of angels to my ears.
GID00027014	Speaking of - that crazy lightshow over the Fort, what the fuck was that, some kind of thumb from God you called down? Amazing, fucking amazing.
GID00027015	Could use a hundred of you, just scatter you over the East like jacks, give those plumed fucks the what-for.
GID00027016	Well, you took your sweet ass time coming here.
GID00027017	Let's get down to brass tacks, we need to get this thing moving if we want to keep the element of surprise.
GID00027018	That was a fine bit of work back there. Truth told, I'm surprised you made it out of there in one piece. You and the Dam.
GID00027019	I'm impressed to say the least, and that's no easy thing. You've secured NCR's future - the administration sends its thanks, for what it's worth.
GID00027020	Damn Brotherhood, bunch of elitist jerks. What were we to do, leave good armor out in the wastes to rust?
GID00027021	Whatever it is, make it quick. I don't have time for idle chatter.
GID00027022	As if I didn't have enough to worry about, one of our facilities was recently broken into and its power diverted.
GID00027023	Have you seen that damned tower in the Strip, all aglow? Of course you've seen it. Everyone's seen it.
GID00027024	That was our power that did that, and I will find out who did it. Did you have something to report?
GID00027025	Not right now, I'm busy.
GID00027026	You again. What do you want?
GID00027027	Good, you made it. I've been receiving reports about the "savior of the NCR" for a while now, and wanted to meet you myself.

GID00027030	Usually, I dispatch one or more rangers to see these things through, but I'm a little shorthanded at the moment. Think you're up for a real mission?
GID00027031	Good, you made it. I've been receiving reports of your activities for a little while now, and wanted to meet you myself.

GID00027042	Usually, I dispatch one or more rangers to see these things through, but I'm a little shorthanded at the moment. Think you're up for a real mission?
GID00027043	Yes, did you have an update on the Khans?
GID00027044	Have you discovered what the Omertas are up to?
GID00027045	Report. Is Mr. House still a threat?
GID00027046	Has the Brotherhood been found?
GID00027047	Is the president safe?
GID00027048	It's best not to keep the general waiting.
GID00027049	Ah, our hero returns. What can I do for you?
GID00027050	You are the courier Lord Caesar has spoken of. The slaughter begins, then.
GID00027051	Greetings, courier. We caught word the battle was about to begin. We arrived before the road was closed off; our warriors are here to assist you.
GID00027052	Alpha Squad reporting in. Thanks for the support back there. We've been assigned to ensure you make it to the Legate. How can we be of assistance?
GID00027053	We are excecuting your commands.
GID00027054	Go on.
GID00027055	Not now!
GID00027056	You shouldn't be here. It's best if you just move along.
GID00027057	Get out of here already.
GID00027058	<Control Room Guard Top Level Topics>
GID00027059	<Control Room Guard Warning Dialogs>
GID00027061	And who is this before me in the colors of the Legion. An envoy... dressed as an insult to all that carry out Caesar's will.
GID00027062	And who are you to come before me... you bear the insignia of the Bear, yet you do not wear it as a soldier of the West wears it.
GID00027063	And the West seeks to appease me by sending a woman? Such gifts are meant for the cowards of Vegas, not for the Legion.
GID00027064	An envoy of Vegas, yet you carry yourself for battle. If so, you cannot *truly* be of that city of cowards.
GID00027065	And who are you to come before me... you don't bear the mark of the Bear, yet are ready for battle.
GID00027066	Your words have done nothing but delay the inevitable. Now, see what my hounds and my blade will bring to you.
GID00027067	For the Legion.
GID00027068	[FAILED] Enough.
GID00027069	Guess it ain't no secret how you, uh... I say, can you ask them to put their weapons down. Was just reaching in my coat to give you a cigar.
GID00027070	Come on, men - we're pulling out.
GID00027071	Got leveled by a goddamn courier - screw the message, it's the messenger that'll fuck you.
GID00027072	What the hell? No, get away from me, you goddamn TV on wheels!
GID00027073	What is this Brahmin shit. I'm not getting the feeling we're all about to sing koombahyah here.
GID00027074	Fucking Mr. House was holding the cards the whole goddamn time. Him and his little errand boy.
GID00027075	Fucking Mr. House was holding the cards the whole goddamn time. Him and his little errand girl.
GID00027076	Should have known, Greeks and gifts. That, and next time, shoot the messenger.
GID00027078	<Topic for House Securitron Dialogue at the End>
GID00027079	So I heard you helped take over Nelson from the Legion. Glad to see someone making a difference around here instead of just complaining.
GID00027080	Thanks again for finding those supplies. I've already started putting them to good use.
GID00027081	If it isn't the guy that saved President Kimball. We owe you a big debt of gratitude. If Kimball died, I don't know what would have happened.
GID00027082	If it isn't the gal that saved President Kimball. We owe you a big debt of gratitude. If Kimball died, I don't know what would have happened.
GID00027083	I can't believe that President Kimball is dead. If I could get my hands on the people that did this I'd rip their heads off with my bare hands.
GID00027084	I can't believe someone tried to assassinate President Kimball. I'm just glad he's still alive. We need a guy like him around.
GID00027085	Are you new? No one told me about any new troops showing up. This is just great, we get new troops and no new supplies for them.
GID00027086	I didn't expect someone as famous as you here. What can I do for you?
GID00027087	Nice to see a friendly face around here. We don't get many visitors of your esteem. Something I can do for you?
GID00027088	You better watch yourself around here. I'm not going to put up with any crazy shit.
GID00027089	Didn't expect someone like you around here. What do you want?
GID00027090	You've got a lot of nerve showing your face around here. You better get out before I throw you out.
GID00027091	What do you want?
GID00027092	If you're looking for supplies I'll make this easy for you... there aren't any.
GID00027093	But something tells me you're not here for that. What do you want?
GID00027094	I still don't have any supplies to spare. Is there something else I can help you with?
GID00027095	<Quartermaster Mayes Top Level Topics>
GID00027096	I have a report here that says the Legion forces at Nelson have been taken care of and that you had a hand in it.
GID00027097	You have my thanks for that. Those guys have been giving us a lot of trouble for a long time now.
GID00027098	Now that they're gone, we'll be able to prepare for the upcoming conflict at Hoover Dam.
GID00027099	I heard you've been helping out Quartermaster Mayes. I appreciate it, we need all the help we can get around here.
GID00027100	I heard you won Private Sexton's little contest. Congratulations. It's nice to have morale up around here.
GID00027101	Dr. Richards told me how you helped him with his missing supplies. It's unfortunate about Private Stone, but at least it's over with now.
GID00027102	I heard about how you saved the President's life. It's a good thing you were there. Things could have turned out really ugly.
GID00027103	It's hard to believe that there was an actual assassination attempt on the President's life. We sure got lucky this time.
GID00027104	I can't believe President Kimball is dead... the last thing we needed around here was another morale hit.
GID00027105	You must be new around here. Something I can do for you?
GID00027106	I didn't expect someone as famous as you to be here. Please tell me you're here to help.
GID00027107	I'm glad to see you here. We could definitely use your help.
GID00027108	I've heard of you. You better not cause any trouble around here, we have enough problems as it is.
GID00027109	Hum... I've heard of you. What do you want?
GID00027110	You've got a lot of nerve coming into our camp.
GID00027111	What do you want?
GID00027112	We're kind of busy around here for social calls, so if you're not here to help out, just stay out of my way.
GID00027113	Back already? What do you need?
GID00027114	<Major Polatli Top Level Topics>
GID00027115	I hear you defeated the Legion forces at Nelson. I'm impressed, and thankful. It'll make my job around here much easier.
GID00027116	I wanted to thank you again for saving my patients. It's nice to have a helping hand around here.
GID00027117	Thanks again for looking into my missing medical supplies. Now I can actually use them on people that need them.
GID00027118	Wow, if it isn't the man who saved President Kimball. What can I do for you this fine day?
GID00027119	Wow, if it isn't the woman who saved President Kimball. What can I do for you this fine day?
GID00027120	I'm relieved to hear that President Kimball survived that assassination attempt.
GID00027121	It's a shame about President Kimball, he was a good man.
GID00027122	You're new, aren't you? What can I do for you?
GID00027123	I'm always a sucker for a pretty face. What can I do for you, my fine dear?
GID00027124	I think it just got a little bit hotter in here. Is there something I can do for you?
GID00027125	There's my little buttercup. What can I do for you?
GID00027126	Ahh... look who it is. What brings someone of your renown into my humble medical center?
GID00027127	I didn't expect to see you here. What can I do for you?
GID00027128	Do you need something, or are you just here to cause trouble?
GID00027129	I've heard about you. No funny stuff or I'll amputate your legs.
GID00027130	You better have a damn good reason for being in my medical center.
GID00027131	Is there something you need?
GID00027132	Unless it's urgent you're going to have to wait. If it's gravely important, save me the trouble and empty your pockets now.
GID00027133	I've got a lot to do. Make it quick.
GID00027134	<Dr Richards Top Level Topics>
GID00027135	I've heard of you, glad to have you on our side.
GID00027136	I've heard of you. Just remember who's side you're on out there.
GID00027137	So you're the one Major Polatli sent?
GID00027138	Let's get going, we don't have much time.
GID00027139	We don't have much time.
GID00027140	That was some battle. Glad to have you on our side, we couldn't have taken back Nelson without your help. You have my thanks.
GID00027141	Are you the Van Graffs' emissary?
GID00027142	Don't talk to me, rookie!
GID00027143	They're all dead. Guy must've had some kind of explosive on him, set off all the ordinance in this place at once.
GID00027144	Congratulations, rookie. You just cost me my job. Don't think I don't appreciate it.
GID00027145	I was just telling Gloria about your performance. Hell of a first day, huh?
GID00027146	Welcome to the Silver Rush, New Vegas's best- ah, I'm just kidding. Go on in.
GID00027147	Welcome to the Silv- ah crap, don't tell me you're my new guard.
GID00027148	Okay, now let's get you geared up. First, your armor.
GID00027149	Standard issue is your run-of-the-mill combat armor, with a nice dark coat of paint for both brand recognition and sheer intimidation value.
GID00027150	Next, your weapon. Guards are required to use rifles. Anything lighter compromises your combat effectiveness.
GID00027151	Anything heavier and people are too scared to come in the door. What's your preference, laser or plasma?
GID00027152	Welcome to the Silver Rush, New Vegas's best source of laser and plasma weapons.
GID00027153	I'm not paid to talk to customers.
GID00027154	You really don't want to start trouble in here.
GID00027155	We're all going to be rich soon. You watch.
GID00027156	One wrong move and you're ash, pal.
GID00027157	You want to chat, talk to the owners.
GID00027158	Good job. I need to work out some last minute details with our new clients, but after that we'll head back to the Rush.
GID00027159	No time to talk. We have to finish these bastards off!
GID00027160	Good, you're here. Do you remember that package I had you deliver? Well, the client liked the sample and put in a massive order.
GID00027161	It's possibly the biggest order we've ever supplied. I've had to repeatedly assure my mother that everything will go smoothly.
GID00027162	And that's where I'm hoping you'll come in. We'll be bringing an escort, and I want you on it. What do you say?
GID00027163	Simon's been telling me how it went. Let's do a quick recap.
GID00027164	Welcome back. Did you have news for me, or are you just here for the guns?
GID00027165	Welcome back. I hope you've been working on that task Jean-Baptiste had for you. My brother is not a patient man by any means.
GID00027166	Welcome to the Silver Rush, where only top of the line energy weapons can be found. What can I do for you?
GID00027167	Well, looks like you came through after all. She's not half bad looking, is she? It's almost a shame...
GID00027168	Crimson Caravan and Van Graffs won't need to worry about you anymore, Mojave's ours, we're shutting you down for good.
GID00027169	That was fun. Did you see the look on that bitch's face? Priceless.
GID00027170	As I live and breathe, Rose of Sharon Cassidy. The late Rose of Sharon Cassidy. Was hoping you were on that caravan I massacred, but...
GID00027171	Crimson Caravan and Van Graffs won't need to worry about you anymore, Mojave's ours, and we're shutting you down for good.
GID00027172	Hey, how's it going? You find that bitch yet or not?
GID00027173	Ah, just the person I was looking for. Your name came up in a discussion we had recently.
GID00027174	My sister is very impressed with you so far, but I'm not. I don't think you have what it takes to work for this family.
GID00027175	Luckily for you, I'm going to give you the chance to prove me wrong. What do you say? Want to make some real money?
GID00027176	What the fuck do you want? I've got no use for fucking cowards.
GID00027177	Glory's the one you want to talk to about working for us. I just handle the details.
GID00027178	Eh? You want something?
GID00027179	Get the fuck away from me. The last man who bothered me "volunteered" to help test our weapons.
GID00027180	Don't hurry me. I'm trying to get your stuff ready.
GID00027181	My favorite employee returns! What can I do for you?
GID00027182	Hi there! Is this where I can pick up a laser gun?
GID00027183	Is that it? Can I go in now?
GID00027184	Howdy! I just done broke the bank over at the Wrangler there and thought I might peruse your fine wares, maybe lighten my purse a little.
GID00027185	Uh, hi. I was, um, in the area and thought I'd stop by to look at your weapons. Can I go in?
GID00027186	Hey, lookin' for something to replace my old revolver. Mind if I head in?
GID00027187	We've already concluded our business. I suggest you return to your employers.
GID00027188	If it isn't the guy that defeated the Legion at Nelson. I can't thank you enough, morale around here has never been higher.
GID00027189	If it isn't the gal that defeated the Legion at Nelson. I can't thank you enough, morale around here has never been higher.
GID00027190	Whoa, didn't you save President Kimball? Glad to have someone like you here!
GID00027191	I heard President Kimball almost got killed at Hoover Dam. That would have been a big blow to morale around here.
GID00027192	Did you hear President Kimball was killed? The guys here aren't taking it very well.
GID00027193	New guy, eh? The more the merrier around here!
GID00027194	New gal, eh? The more the merrier around here!
GID00027195	Hey everybody, look who it is! Glad to have you here friend. What can I do for you?
GID00027196	Look who we have here. Always nice to see a friend of the NCR. What can I do for you?
GID00027197	You're not going to do anything crazy here, are you?
GID00027198	Uh... is there something I can help you with?
GID00027199	Hey, I don't think it's a good idea for you to be here.
GID00027200	What brings someone like you here?
GID00027201	Hey there. The names Sexton. Private James Sexton. Welcome to Forlorn Hope.
GID00027202	Hey there, champ. Good to see you again.
GID00027203	Well speak of the devil! The head of the pack!
GID00027204	What can I do for you?
GID00027206	Kill me!
GID00027207	Stay away!
GID00027208	I'm afraid you're not going to find much help here. We've got our hands full as it is.
GID00027209	If you're heading out, be careful. There's been lots of Legion raiding parties around lately.
GID00027210	Let's do this shit!
GID00027211	Those Legion bastards aren't going to know what hit them!
GID00027212	We're going to tear them apart!
GID00027213	Let's go!
GID00027214	We showed them a thing or two.
GID00027215	A little payback feels real good.
GID00027216	These bastards got what they deserved.
GID00027217	This has been a long time coming. The rest of the Legion better watch out.
GID00027218	No time to talk. I have to keep watch for Legion raiding parties.
GID00027219	Sorry. I can't talk right now.
GID00027220	It's hard to stay awake on watch with only a few hours of sleep. I wish we actually had time to rest around here.
GID00027221	I hope nothing happens on my watch. I'm too damn tired to fight back right now.
GID00027222	Watch yourself, we got hit by a Legion raiding party just the other night.
GID00027223	Stay out of trouble, we have enough problems here as it is.
GID00027224	Better move along, there's not much for you here.
GID00027225	I don't have time to talk. There's lots of work to be done here.
GID00027226	Sorry, I'm busy right now.
GID00027227	These troops did a good job holding off the Legion. Now it's time to fight back.
GID00027228	We finally took back Nelson from those Legion bastards!
GID00027229	I heard you helped destroy the Legion at Nelson. Thanks!
GID00027230	I'm glad that the Legion base at Nelson is destroyed. Now maybe we can get some rest.
GID00027231	If I have to put up with another night of Private Stone's whining, I swear I'm going to strangle him.
GID00027232	I heard Private Stone was caught stealing medical supplies. I always hated that guy.
GID00027233	I heard Private Stone turned himself in for stealing medical supplies. We're all stressed out here, but stealing medical supplies is low.
GID00027234	Private Sexton was thinking of having a contest to see who can kill the most Legion. I wonder if he ever got that going.
GID00027235	I heard you won Private Sexton's Legion killing contest. Nice job, that'll teach those Legion bastards!
GID00027236	I heard Quartermaster Mayes sent some guys out for supplies and they never came back. I wonder if they just ran off instead.
GID00027237	One of my buddies said that he saw Caesar out rallying the Legion. If that's true, we're definitely screwed.
GID00027238	Holy shit! Did you hear that Caesar is dead? Maybe we actually have a fighting chance now.
GID00027239	I heard that Caesar was killed by his own Lieutenants. I wonder if their infighting will give us a break for a while.
GID00027240	I heard Chief Hanlon is dead. How are we going to fight the Legion without him?
GID00027241	I heard Chief Hanlon was a traitor. How could he betray the NCR? It just doesn't make sense.
GID00027242	I hear we got reinforced by the troops that were in Boulder City. It's good to have some extra support around here.
GID00027243	More reinforcements are in from Primm. Damn glad to have those guys here.
GID00027244	I heard that some of the NCR Rangers are on their way to help us out. We'll make short work of the Legion with their help.
GID00027245	Holy shit those NCR Rangers are badass! I wish I was that cool.
GID00027246	I heard the Legion veteran troops are coming to the front lines. That's the last thing we need right now.
GID00027247	I heard the Legion took out another one of our patrols. If this continues there won't be many of us left.
GID00027248	I hear more troops are gathering at Hoover Dam. Things are probably going to get pretty messy over there real soon.
GID00027249	The Legion is torturing captive troopers in Nelson. I'd rather die fighting then be captured.
GID00027250	The Legion is using our dead troops as booby traps. I'd think twice before rushing to someone's aid.
GID00027251	If I have to pull another double shift again I'm going to collapse from exhaustion.
GID00027252	I wish we could get some real food out here. I haven't had a good hot meal in weeks.
GID00027253	Quartermaster Mayes was yelling at us about rationing again. Where does the guy get the energy to yell so much while on rations?
GID00027254	Some of the other guys told me that the Legion troops eat their own dead to gain their strength, but they're kidding, right?
GID00027255	I got bit by one of those dirty dogs the Legion has. I wonder if they've got rabies... maybe I should see Dr. Richards.
GID00027256	Major Polatli is putting everyone on double shifts to make up for recent losses to the Legion. That guy never gives up.
GID00027257	If the NCR wasn't spread so thin, maybe we could actually get some supplies and reinforcements around here.
GID00027258	I wish I was stationed at McCarran. I heard they still get to hit the Strip for R&R. We haven't had R&R in ages.
GID00027259	We are so fucked here! How can we ever hope to fight off the entire Legion?
GID00027260	Another day, another battle, another dead trooper. When is this shit going to end?
GID00027261	It seems like for every Legion soldier we kill, two more take his place. How many of them are there?
GID00027262	The last patrol I was on got hit by a Legion raiding party and I barely survived. I don't want to go back out there again.
GID00027263	How do they expect us to fight the Legion with only the crappy equipment and gear they gave us?
GID00027264	I can't wait for General Oliver to get out here. He could turn this place around.
GID00027265	I don't know how we're going to hold of the Legion here and at Hoover Dam, we just don't have the manpower.
GID00027266	The Legion is assembling a massive army on the other side of the river. How can we stop an army when we can't even handle their raiding parties?
GID00027267	Hello again. Remember to stop by one of these nights. Northwest, by the old train station.
GID00027268	You looking to take the test again?
GID00027269	Hello, don't think I've seen your face before. Are you a citizen of the NCR?
GID00027270	Hello again. We spoke briefly before, but remind me, are you a citizen of the NCR?
GID00027271	Hey there. We hope to see you by the train station one of these nights.
GID00027272	Ah, you're back. Did you want to take that test again now?
GID00027273	You look like a person in need of a good meal. You wouldn't happen to be an NCR citizen, would you?
GID00027274	That meal's still available, but only to NCR citizens. You are an NCR citizen, aren't you?
GID00027275	I've held up my end. You tell the King that I'm willing to listen to him.
GID00027276	This isn't really a good time. What did you want?
GID00027277	Welcome. There's food and water here for any citizen of the NCR. Please, have some.
GID00027278	Yes, was there something else you needed?
GID00027279	Got a second, trooper? I've got something important that needs to get done, but nobody's stepping up to help me out. I'm hoping you're different.
GID00027280	Hey, you're not one of the troopers... got a second? I have work I need done and nobody here at the camp has the time or inclination to help me out.
GID00027281	You should've heard the cheers over the radio when news of the victory came back from the Dam.
GID00027282	I've been trying to sort out the rumors from the facts, but with the Legion coming, I guess it doesn't matter. The news is all bad.
GID00027283	Lots of confusion over the radio. Somehow the NCR lost the Dam, but the Legion didn't get it, either?
GID00027284	Hey, what did Chief Hanlon have to say about those false reports we uncovered?
GID00027285	Welcome back.
GID00027286	This ain't your business. Walk off and forget you saw anything.
GID00027287	We got the message. We're going.
GID00027288	You didn't see nothin', got it?
GID00027289	You'll get no trouble from me.
GID00027290	Hey, I just do what I'm told.
GID00027291	Thank you! They were going to kill me!
GID00027292	Don't worry, I'll stay out of trouble from now on. Honest.
GID00027293	Please, ma'am - take pity on us. Free us, I'm begging you!
GID00027294	Please, sir - take pity on us. Free us, please!
GID00027295	When will we be free?
GID00027296	I can't ever thank you enough for saving me and mine! We're free now!
GID00027297	You're a killer. Go away.
GID00027298	We're being held here against our will! I beg you, help us!
GID00027299	Are you going to free us, or what?
GID00027300	Thank you. We never would've escaped without your help.
GID00027301	At least I'm free to bury my kin.
GID00027302	You killed my kin. Why is this happening to me?
GID00027303	Oh, it's just awful here. Can't you help us?
GID00027304	You're still gonna free us, aren't you?
GID00027305	Thank you so much for freeing me!
GID00027306	You looking for a pat on the back? My mother is dead.
GID00027307	Caesar may have deemed you worthy to bear his mark, but your reputation preceeds you.
GID00027308	Your presence will be tolerated, but you are not welcome here. Lucullus awaits you on the docks.
GID00027309	Do not make Caesar wait! Lucullus awaits you on the dock.
GID00027310	A Profligate bearing the Mark of Caesar? What is the world coming to?
GID00027311	Cursor Lucullus is waiting for you with the barge at the docks. He will take you to The Fort to speak with Caesar.
GID00027312	Get moving, Profligate! Do not make Caesar wait!
GID00027313	Don't try my patience. A nod of my chin, and you'll be decorating a cross.
GID00027314	You taught Severus well! Soon I'll wear a necklace of Profligates' toes, blown off by their own mines!
GID00027315	Don't try my patience. A nod of my chin, and you'll be decorating a cross.
GID00027316	Yes? Name your concern.
GID00027317	I warned them about that truck weeks ago. Always be prepared for any hazardous radiation I said.
GID00027318	Those headstrong fools should have listened...
GID00027319	Are you ready to head upriver?
GID00027320	Ave. Are you ready to head upriver?
GID00027321	Caesar awaits you in his tent. You have license to find your own way.
GID00027322	I'll wait here, to ferry you back to the western shore when your visit has concluded.
GID00027323	Ave. Are you ready to travel to the Fort?
GID00027324	Caesar has permitted you to leave, but not with the Platinum Chip in your possession. Relinquish it and you may go.
GID00027325	Ave. Are you ready to return to Cottonwood Cove?
GID00027326	By order of Caesar, all visitors must disarm and relinquish all banned items. This order also extends to the Platinum Chip you carry - for now.
GID00027327	Caesar has permitted you to leave, but not with the Platinum Chip in your possession. Relinquish it and you may go.
GID00027328	By order of Caesar, all visitors must disarm and relinquish all banned items.
GID00027329	You may proceed. Your belongings will be returned when you leave.
GID00027330	Halt! What business have you in Cottonwood Cove, outsider?
GID00027331	You're the one Lucullus said would come? You'll find him waiting for you, down at the docks.
GID00027332	What are you doing standing around, whelp? {KAI-zar)Caesar awaits!
GID00027333	You're the one Lucullus said would come. You'll find him waiting for you, down at the docks.
GID00027334	Scum such as you does not belong here. Leave, or be added to the dead.
GID00027335	Trade with Canyon Runner if you like. Make trouble and things won't go well for you.
GID00027336	You did well to give Centurion Aurelius the Profligates' listening machine. We'll butcher the troops they send to ambush our patrols.
GID00027337	Ave. Name your business.
GID00027338	I see you bear the Mark of Caesar! Cursor Lucullus awaits you at the docks!
GID00027339	Caesar does not like to be kept waiting. I would find Cursor Lucullus quickly and travel to The Fort, if I were you.
GID00027340	He should still be waiting at the docks.
GID00027341	Ave. Have you come to sell or trade for captures?
GID00027342	Ave. How goes it?
GID00027343	Yeah! Who won the lottery? I did!
GID00027344	Smell that air! Couldn't ya just drink it like booze!
GID00027345	Stop bothering me, will ya! I won the fucking lottery!
GID00027346	Fuck off! Win your own fucking lottery!
GID00027347	Are you fucking kidding me?
GID00027348	First I get my legs smashed, and then in walks the Powder Gangers' grim fucking reaper? What the fuck have you got against us, man?
GID00027349	Jesus fucking Christ, if you want me dead just gimme 15 Med-X and I'll fucking O.D. for ya, okay? Fuck!
GID00027350	Are you fucking kidding me?
GID00027351	First I get my legs smashed, and then in walks the Powder Gangers' grim fucking reaper? What the fuck have you got against us, bitch?
GID00027352	Jesus fucking Christ, if you want me dead just gimme 15 Med-X and I'll fucking O.D. for ya, okay? Fuck!
GID00027353	Goddammit, I was nodding off until you barged in here! And I don't hurt when I sleep!
GID00027354	Wait - you're that courier. Hey. know what Boxcars needs, friend? Some fucking pain relief!
GID00027355	Goddammit, I was nodding off until you barged in here! And I don't hurt when I sleep!
GID00027356	Just give me some goddamn Med-X and fuck off, will ya?
GID00027357	What is it this time?
GID00027358	Well, isn't this a surprise. I was just finishing up here. To think that we might have missed each other!
GID00027359	It's fitting you got to see how I punished this town, for such is your fate. You will die for your crimes against the Legion!
GID00027360	How interesting! You're the Profligate courier who's been of some assistance to the Legion.
GID00027361	Well, well, well! If it isn't our favorite courier - trekker of the wastes, killer of Mr. House!
GID00027362	Well, well, well! What's our favorite courier doing so far from the Strip? Don't you have a special delivery to give to Mr. House?
GID00027363	Oh. I don't know if you recognize me from the Strip, when I handed you the Mark of Caesar? I wasn't wearing a dog's head at the time.
GID00027364	Don't worry, I won't have you lashed to a cross like the rest of these degenerates. It's useful that you happened by.
GID00027365	I want you to witness the fate of the town of Nipton, to memorize every detail. And then, when you move on?
GID00027366	I want you to teach everyone you meet the lesson that Caesar's Legion taught here, especially any NCR troops you run across.
GID00027367	Was there more for us to discuss?
GID00027368	I was just finishing up making an example of this town, delivering a sermon, if you will.
GID00027369	When you move on, head west to the Mojave Outpost and tell the Profligate troops what you found here.
GID00027370	Hah! And we were just finishing up here. To think that we might have missed you!
GID00027371	If anyone belongs on a cross, it's you! For your crimes against the Legion, you will die!
GID00027372	How interesting! You're the Profligate courier who's been of some assistance to the Legion.
GID00027373	Well, well, well! If it isn't the Legion's favorite courier - trekker of the wastes, killer of Mr. House!
GID00027374	Well, well, well! What's the Legion's favorite courier doing so far from the Strip? Don't you have a special delivery to give to Mr. House?
GID00027375	Well, well, well! I've heard of you - the courier upon whom mighty Caesar has bestowed his Mark!
GID00027376	Don't worry, I won't have you lashed to a cross like the rest of these degenerates. It's useful that you happened by.
GID00027377	I want you to witness the fate of Nipton, to memorize every detail. And then, when you move on?
GID00027378	Well, I'd like you to move west towards the Mojave Outpost, to let the Profligates there know about the little sermon I prepared for them here.
GID00027379	Was there more for us to discuss?
GID00027380	I was just finishing up making an example of this town, delivering a sermon, if you will.
GID00027381	When you move on, head west to the Mojave Outpost and tell the Profligate troops what you found here.
GID00027382	Heard you helped out Jackson, thanks for that. Caravans are still waiting for clearance to move out, but at least there's movement.
GID00027383	Coming from the North? Must be crazy to brave those roads.
GID00027384	Something else you wanted?
GID00027385	It was such an honor to be here today. I'm so lucky.
GID00027386	I'm too young to die!
GID00027387	President Kimball is really well spoken.
GID00027388	Not right now. President Kimball is giving his speech.
GID00027389	The Legion is attacking! Run for your lives!
GID00027390	Not now!
GID00027391	Report.
GID00027392	<Static>
GID00027393	I'll meet you on the observation deck.
GID00027394	What do you want?
GID00027395	You again. What is it?
GID00027396	We've got a lot to do to prepare for the President's visit and not much time.
GID00027397	Have you finished your security sweep?
GID00027398	Come back in a minute, I'm busy with security matters.
GID00027399	Shouldn't you be keeping an eye out for anything suspicious?
GID00027400	Good job today. We got the President out safe and sound and I couldn't have done it without you. You have my thanks.
GID00027401	Damnit! I can't believe the President is dead. It's all my fault!
GID00027403	Hey, I heard about you. What can I do for you, friend?
GID00027404	What is it?
GID00027405	<K9 Ranger Dialog>
GID00027406	Is there a problem here?
GID00027407	You again. What's your problem?
GID00027408	Do you mind?
GID00027409	<Legion Bomber Top Level Topics>
GID00027410	<Roof Guard Warning Dialogs>
GID00027411	You're cleared to go on through.
GID00027412	No one can go upstairs without authorization.
GID00027413	<Roof Guard Top Level Topics>
GID00027414	Didn't expect Caesar to send a woman to do this job.
GID00027415	Oh well, at least you're here now. I was starting to get lonely out here by myself.
GID00027416	It's about time you showed up.
GID00027417	I was starting to get lonely out here by myself.
GID00027418	Make it quick. We don't have much time.
GID00027419	What is it?
GID00027420	<Cato Hostilius Top Level Topics>
GID00027421	I still haven't found my lucky helmet yet.
GID00027422	Thanks for finding my lucky helmet. It's my favorite!
GID00027423	Hey-o!
GID00027424	<Watson Top Level Topics>
GID00027425	What are you doing up here?
GID00027426	Kind of busy up here.
GID00027427	<Legion Sniper Top Level Topics>
GID00027428	Hey, you haven't seen my friend around here, have you? His name is Ben and he's an engineer.
GID00027429	We were supposed to meet up so we can watch the President's speech together, but he hasn't shown up yet.
GID00027430	Leave me alone.
GID00027431	Still no luck finding my friend. He better show up soon.
GID00027432	Do you mind?
GID00027433	We're a bit busy here.
GID00027434	Why don't you mind your own business.
GID00027435	Managing security on short notice is going to be tough. We'll have to keep the crowd small for the speech.
GID00027436	It's unlikely that the Legion will try anything, but we'll be prepared for it anyway.
GID00027437	We'll keep civilian presence to a minimum. That should avoid any unnecessary risks.
GID00027438	What the fuck just happened?
GID00027439	What is going on?
GID00027440	Quiet, I'm trying to listen to the speech.
GID00027441	Shh! I want to hear what is going on.
GID00027442	Leave me alone, I'm trying to pay attention.
GID00027443	I'm so excited about he President visiting. This is going to be great!
GID00027444	I'm looking forward to seeing the President.
GID00027445	I'm just glad to have the day off for this.
GID00027446	I wonder what President Kimball is going to talk about today.
GID00027447	That was a great speech.
GID00027448	That's a nice suit President Kimball had.
GID00027449	I don't have time to talk right now.
GID00027450	We need to keep an eye out for anything suspicious.
GID00027451	Nothing is going to happen to the President on my watch.
GID00027452	Move along.
GID00027453	You really saved our asses out there against the Legion. Thanks.
GID00027454	I can't believe that President Kimball was attacked. I'm just relieved that nothing bad happened to him.
GID00027455	I can't believe President Kimball is dead. He was a great leader for the NCR.
GID00027456	So you're the one that has been running errands for Colonel Moore. Do you need something?
GID00027457	Well look who it is! What can I do for you?
GID00027458	Always nice to have a friend of the NCR around. What can I help you with?
GID00027459	You better watch yourself around here. I'm not going to put up with any of your crazy shit.
GID00027460	Something you need?
GID00027461	You've got a lot of nerves being here. Maybe you should just leave instead.
GID00027462	What do you want?
GID00027463	I don't think you're in the right place. You looking for something?
GID00027464	Is there something I can do for you?
GID00027465	<Top Level Topics for Quartermaster Bardon>
GID00027466	Back off.
GID00027467	Watch it.
GID00027468	Welcome to Jacobstown, human. You're free to walk around, just don't stare at the Nightkin. They don't like people looking at them.
GID00027469	And if you're NCR, keep it to yourself. They're not popular around here.
GID00027470	Got a problem, could use your help. Been having trouble with NCR mercs harassing the town, and they just showed up again.
GID00027471	Just had to go and start a fight with the mercs, didn't you. Guess we'd better finish things.
GID00027472	Not the outcome I was hoping for with the mercs. At least it buys us time to build up our defenses.
GID00027473	Had hoped to start reaching out to NCR, start talking trade and borders. It'll be more difficult now.
GID00027474	So, Keene's dead. Knew it might come to that some day. Makes things difficult for the town.
GID00027475	Without Keene, it'll be hard to convince other Nightkin in the wasteland to come here. And harder to get the ones here to stay.
GID00027476	Was hard enough to convince Keene to come up here in the first place, and you gave him an excuse to leave. Better than killing him, I guess.
GID00027477	Always a chance I could get him to come back. Not counting on it. Hope the town doesn't take the blame for whatever trouble he gets into.
GID00027478	I like how you handled Keene. Without the Nightkin around, Jacobstown would be much weaker than it is.
GID00027479	Something on your mind?
GID00027480	Huh. I'd heard there were new people in town, but I thought it was more Super Mutants. Nice to meet you - I'm Calamity.
GID00027481	Losing Marcus is bad news for Jacobstown. I doubt the mutants will stick around for long.
GID00027482	With Doctor Henry off to rejoin his Enclave friends, he's left it up to me to carry on with the research here.
GID00027483	Hey, there.
GID00027484	So, the Reds finally hit us, just like I always said they would. Vegas is still there as far as I know, but that probably won't last long.
GID00027485	Didn't get accepted into one of the Vaults, so I did the next best thing and had this place built. Got massive debts, but who cares now? Ha!
GID00027486	It's every man for himself now. Had to take care of the Paulson boy since he knew about this place - these supplies are for me and nobody else.
GID00027487	There's a woman and her daughter up in one of the rooms at the Lodge. Might go pay 'em a visit tomorrow. A man's got needs.
GID00027488	Another human. One was enough.
GID00027489	I always told Marcus we could never get along with humans. I'm right, and he's dead.
GID00027490	Bother someone else. I don't want anything to do with you.
GID00027491	Huh. With the big guy dead, I guess we're done here. You've made my employers very happy.
GID00027492	Our business is with the muties, not you.
GID00027493	Our business is with the muties, not you.
GID00027494	What?
GID00027495	We got nothing left to talk about.
GID00027496	I hope it will snow later.
GID00027497	Stupid Big Horners were making noise all night again.
GID00027498	Spotted some humans down the road. Could be Great Khans again.
GID00027499	Some days I miss being in the Master's army.
GID00027500	You think Marcus could get us some miniguns? Or missile launchers?
GID00027501	Better watch out. Lily's been babbling about her grandkids again.
GID00027502	Doctor Henry's pretty smart - for a human.
GID00027503	Ugh. Need to tighten up my vises again.
GID00027504	Damn mercs. Glad you got rid of them.
GID00027505	No more reason to stick around since Marcus is dead.
GID00027506	Thanks for helping Doctor Henry with his research.
GID00027507	A cure for the Nightkin is supposed to be on the way.
GID00027508	I heard it'll still be some time before the Nightkin are cured. Hope they stick around that long.
GID00027509	The Nightkin aren't going to stick around long with Keene dead. Not without a good reason, anyway.
GID00027510	The Nightkin aren't going to stick around long now that Keene's left. Not without a good reason, anyway.
GID00027511	Without Marcus, Jacobstown won't last long.
GID00027512	I like it up here. Nice and cool.
GID00027513	I'm helping Doctor Henry with his experiment right now, dear. Come see me again in a bit.
GID00027514	Jimmy? Little Jimmy - my, how you're grown up. So good of you to come visit your grandma.
GID00027515	My word, but that was a lot of chopping at that casino, dear.
GID00027516	Naughty children run from their punishment, but we'll find Benny, won't we Leo?
GID00027517	Heavens to Betsy, but Mr. Benny met a nasty end. I hope you've realized, pumpkin, that crime doesn't pay.
GID00027518	My, but that Lucky 38 is a large building. And so fancy!
GID00027519	Leo doesn't like that you left that House man alive, dearie. He thinks you should have let us chop him.
GID00027520	You should have heard Leo, sweetie. He laughed and laughed when that old man in the box exploded.
GID00027521	Leo thinks there will be lots more chopping to do now that Caesar is dead. I do hope you'll be careful, pumpkin.
GID00027522	Grandma's so proud of her little pumpkin, rescuing the President like that!
GID00027523	Now sweetie, if at first you don't succeed, try, try again. That goes for learning to ride bikes and killing Presidents!
GID00027524	Grandma's so proud of her little pumpkin, assassinating the President like that!
GID00027525	Leo's very grumpy, pumpkin. He wanted to chop the President!
GID00027526	Look at you, sweetness! Blowing up a robot army all by yourself, isn't that precious?
GID00027527	Grandma's so worried about her little baby! It's getting dangerous out there in the Wasteland!
GID00027528	Leo's getting more and more agitated, sweetie. I think he can smell the fight coming.
GID00027529	I hope you're not thinking about rushing off to that big dam, pumpkin! It's sure to be very dangerous!
GID00027530	Hello again, dear.
GID00027531	Hello again, dear.
GID00027532	Oh, thank God! I didn't think I'd ever see another human face down here.
GID00027533	Please, buddy, you've got to help me. I don't know how much longer I'm going to last with my leg like this.
GID00027534	Come on man, my leg is killing me.
GID00027535	Is it safe to leave yet?
GID00027536	Keep it down, we don't want to alert the freaks.
GID00027537	No time to talk, we've still got fish heads to deal with.
GID00027538	Let's talk after we get the hell out of here.
GID00027539	Well well, it looks like we've cleared them out, damn inbred mutant freaks. Think I'll start heading back to California now.
GID00027540	There have been way too many catastrophic NCR foul-ups around here for me to risk my life by sticking around.
GID00027541	Thanks for getting me out of there. I better get started back to California.
GID00027542	Thanks for helping me out. I won't forget it.
GID00027543	Unnnh... please... help me.
GID00027544	Thanks for getting me down from that cross. I owe you one.
GID00027545	Thanks again for saving my ass.
GID00027546	Get away from me, you lunatic!
GID00027547	Anders told me what happened. We owe you one for rescuing him. Tell you what: I can give you caps as a thank you, or a special recipe Jack cooked up.
GID00027548	Any luck finding Anders?
GID00027549	You're not one of my regulars. What do you want?
GID00027550	I've been hearing a lot of good things about you. What's up?
GID00027551	Hey! Seems like you've been making lots of friends around here.
GID00027552	Oh, uh, hey - Jack can probably give you a discount, if that'll calm you down.
GID00027553	Look, we'll be happy to sell you any chems you want, just don't do anything crazy, okay?
GID00027554	If there's something you want, spill it - otherwise, move along.
GID00027555	Make it quick - I don't want to be seen with you.
GID00027556	Dammit, someone offed Motor-Runner! That guy was one of our biggest clients.
GID00027557	Someone's been picking off the leaders of the Fiends down in New Vegas. That's going to cut into our profits.
GID00027558	Did you make that delivery yet?
GID00027559	Hey, what's up?
GID00027560	Whoa. New guy.
GID00027561	Whoa. New chick.
GID00027562	Hey, look who it is bringing that good Khan karma around!
GID00027563	How's my most favoritest friend?
GID00027564	You seriously ought to mellow out, take some chill pills. I could sell you some, if you want.
GID00027565	You seem really... high-strung. You know, I'm sure some of what I make my chems out of was an antipsychotic at some point....
GID00027566	I'm all for live and let live, you know, but a lot of folks around here... umm... aren't.
GID00027567	Why do you have to harsh my mellow? Just be cool, you dig?
GID00027568	Hey, what's up?
GID00027569	Looks like we got a new visitor in the ol' Brahmin pen. Not many people coming here in a hurry, only passing through.
GID00027570	And if you're passing through, you picked a bad time. Road north has gone to hell, and if I let a caravan through, they won't make it.
GID00027571	Appreciate the help. Wish I had more work for you, but nothing else on the radar at the moment.
GID00027572	Caravan, citizen, pilgrim, or...?
GID00027573	Been doing a lot of good work out there, setting an example for the others - I know Ranger Jackson appreciates it.
GID00027574	Back again, I see. Something you need?
GID00027575	Got some nerve, coming to an NCR outpost with that look about you. Hope you aren't here to trade, not sure you can afford the prices.
GID00027576	New face in the Outpost, must've come from the North. So - what'll you have?
GID00027577	Back round? Just my luck... what'll it be this time?
GID00027578	Something else you needed? I'm short-handed here.
GID00027579	Any luck up by the track?
GID00027580	Hnh - didn't even hear you come up the ramp. You don't broadcast your movements. I like that.
GID00027581	Hnh. Heard your footsteps coming up the ramp, didn't sound like a trooper or one of the merchants.
GID00027582	You a Courier? If so, this might be your lucky day... if you don't mind walking a bit and your eyes are good.
GID00027583	Change your mind? Offer's still open, lot of smoke from Nipton in the East, could use a set of eyes over there.
GID00027584	You check out the Nipton Town Hall yet? Smoke trail's not getting any shorter.
GID00027585	Thanks for the assist. Wish others around here had your drive.
GID00027586	You a Courier? If so, this might be your lucky day... if you don't mind walking a bit and your eyes are good.
GID00027587	You're the one making a name for yourself among the troops, aren't you? What is it you need?
GID00027588	Ah, the vaunted hero of the Legion. What can I do for you?
GID00027589	You've been quite difficult to predict, my friend. I hope I can sway you more solidly to the Legion's way of thinking.
GID00027590	Caesar is not fond of loose cannons like yourself. I sincerely hope you change your ways before something drastic must occur.
GID00027591	I've been warned about you. You are perilously close to making an enemy of Caesar, and that is not wise.
GID00027592	I understand you've been invited to meet with Caesar. You should be aware of the honor you've been granted.
GID00027593	If we weren't in Khan territory I would kill you where you stand. Caesar will be avenged!
GID00027594	Caesar's death was tragic, but do not think that it will break the Legion's resolve.
GID00027595	Caesar's veterans will arrive from Arizona soon, and there will be no stopping our victory.
GID00027596	Greetings in the name of Caesar.
GID00027597	I understand you've been talking to the Great Khans about breaking their oaths to great Caesar. I would call that... unwise.
GID00027598	What more do you want?
GID00027599	I haven't seen you before - what brings you to the Great Khans?
GID00027600	It's good to have you here. What can I do for you?
GID00027601	You honor the Great Khans with your presence. What can I do to help you?
GID00027602	You're always... interesting to have around.
GID00027603	What are you doing here?
GID00027604	If you're smart, you'll find somewhere else to be.
GID00027605	You're becoming quite the political agitator. I can't say I'm displeased.
GID00027606	Something else you wanted?
GID00027607	We'll begin readying the camp to move. As soon as Caesar makes his move, we'll depart. We will make ourselves strong again, and we shall conquer!
GID00027608	So, the cub enters the wolf's den. What do you want, cub?
GID00027609	All four of my most trusted advisors have told me we should break our alliance - maybe I should hear you out after all.
GID00027610	I'm beginning to hear troubling rumors from my advisors. Would you know anything about that?
GID00027611	More of my advisors are starting to talk openly of breaking our alliance. I wonder where that idea is coming from?
GID00027612	I understand you dealt the NCR a crushing defeat at Forlorn Hope. I hope that trend continues.
GID00027613	That's why I've made a decision: I'm naming you my heir. When I die, leadership of the Great Khans will pass to you.
GID00027614	You've been doing good things for us - don't think I haven't noticed. What can I do for you?
GID00027615	It's always a pleasure to see you around the camp.
GID00027616	Are you going to help us this time, or vex us?
GID00027617	And so the unpredictable one returns. What do you want from us?
GID00027618	I've got little enough patience for you. Consider your words carefully - you don't want me as an enemy.
GID00027619	In the past, I'd have had someone like you executed for showing their face here - consider yourself lucky I don't have the warriors to spare.
GID00027620	Ah, you're back. What else do you need?
GID00027621	Not now, I'm busy.
GID00027622	You look like someone with a question. What can I do for you?
GID00027623	I'm so much happier now. Thank you again.
GID00027624	What do you want?
GID00027625	Oh look, it's the conformist tool.
GID00027626	How much ass did you have to kick to get Papa Khan to like you so much?
GID00027627	Oh, hey. What's up?
GID00027628	I can't believe you're talking to me, this is so cool! I mean, uh... dude, what's up?
GID00027629	You going to make fun of me too?
GID00027630	I really don't want to deal with this right now.
GID00027631	What?
GID00027632	You're here for the money. I told the Omertas I was good for it! I just need more time!
GID00027633	You're not part of my unit... no, you're here for the money! I told the Omertas I was good for it!
GID00027634	Oh, uh, hey.
GID00027635	No run-ins with the Great Khans, I hope? They've been more restless than usual.
GID00027636	This area isn't safe for civilians. You don't want to get caught by the Great Khans.
GID00027637	Yeah?
GID00027638	This post isn't someplace a civilian ought to be.
GID00027639	You a transfer from one of the other posts? I haven't seen you around before.
GID00027640	You're really not supposed to be here.
GID00027641	You're not part of this post as far as I know. What do you want?
GID00027642	This is a military outpost. Why are you here?
GID00027643	Did you need something else?
GID00027644	Hey there. Is McCarran having you check up on us?
GID00027645	McCarran doesn't like it when civilians wander into military outposts, so if you're here on business, better make it quick.
GID00027646	You're back. What's up?
GID00027647	You better get moving kid, there's bad guys to kill.
GID00027648	Kreger's the officer here, not me. The final say on the plan is up to him.
GID00027649	Moreno and I never did get along. Still, he was a fellow soldier from the old days.
GID00027650	The NCR's the best bet for the wasteland. I'm glad we'll be helping them out.
GID00027651	I'm not helping the Legion, no matter how much you talk them up. I will help my friends prepare, but that's it.
GID00027652	Well, it's about about damn time. What took you... oh.
GID00027653	What brings you around this time?
GID00027654	Let's get going, we have a battle to win.
GID00027655	You don't strike me as someone down on their luck. What brings you to Westside?
GID00027656	Glad to see you made it here all right. So, who are we going up against?
GID00027657	Still waiting on that decision...
GID00027658	We saw everything through the security monitor. I had no idea Moreno would ever pull something like that.
GID00027659	By rights, Moreno's Power Armor now belongs to you. Whitman's volunteered to show you how to use it, so talk to her as soon as you can.
GID00027660	Moreno's a stubborn son of a bitch, but he's also tougher than any of us. I'm glad you were able to talk him into staying.
GID00027661	Since Whitman will be staying with the vertibird, she's offered to give her old suit of Power Armor to you.
GID00027662	You'll need special training to use it properly, so talk to her as soon as you get the chance.
GID00027663	We'll be ready, don't worry.
GID00027664	Sticking around for the attractions?
GID00027665	We're all here. Talk to Kreger about what you've got in mind.
GID00027666	If I had any idea Moreno was capable of doing something that, I'd have warned you. I'm sorry it played out like this.
GID00027667	The NCR's got its share of warts, but I'd rather have them around than the Legion.
GID00027668	I'm not sure if helping the Legion is the right idea. But, I'm going along with it.
GID00027669	Keep your head down - could be snipers around.
GID00027670	I assume this is about something important? You're interrupting my research.
GID00027671	The equipment is hooked up and ready. We can start the test as soon as you give me the go ahead.
GID00027672	Again you interrupt me. Why?
GID00027673	Is there something else I can do for you?
GID00027674	What are you talking to me for? Talk to Kreger.
GID00027675	Now is not the time!
GID00027676	Bah. Looks like I forgot to lock the doors again. If you're with the NCR, get out. This place is mine, and I'm not leaving.
GID00027677	Look, trooper, I was living in this house long before your farms got set up. Don't even think about evicting me.
GID00027678	I didn't come all the way out here just so we could save the fucking NCR. I'm out.
GID00027679	I can't believe I'm going to help the NCR.
GID00027680	Since Johnson won't be coming with us, you might as well take his suit of Power Armor. I'll teach you the basics of how to use it.
GID00027681	Yeah?
GID00027682	I'm ready to fly once we've got a plan. Talk to Judah.
GID00027683	Damn it, Orion. Why did you have to go and do something like that?
GID00027684	Orion always did have a temper, but it was pretty low of him to ambush you like that.
GID00027685	I appreciate you keeping Orion in the group. Since I won't be needing my armor - makes the cockpit a bit cramped - you should take it.
GID00027686	It'll take a few hours to show you how to use it properly, so let's get started.
GID00027687	I'd love to see the look on the NCR's face when I swoop down in my chopper.
GID00027688	I heard the Legion doesn't care for women, but as long as they stay out of my way, I'll get along just fine with them.
GID00027689	Fine weather for flying. It's times like these that make me miss it all.
GID00027690	Your travels been going all right?
GID00027691	Oh, you here to work? I think I have an extra shovel around here somewhere.
GID00027692	Sorry, I don't have time to talk right now. Talk to Trent, he might be able to help you out.
GID00027693	Greetings! Pardon my enthusiasm. I'm not accustomed to meeting so many new people, but I find you fascinating.
GID00027694	I've tried to learn as much as possible about the surface world since our community left our home.
GID00027695	Hello again, outlander.
GID00027696	Why are the outlanders killing each other? Why do they treat us like machines? I wish we had remained in the safety, and sanity, of our Vault.
GID00027697	Hello, outlander.
GID00027698	It's good making your acquaintance.
GID00027699	Excuse me, I'm... not from around here.
GID00027700	Horowitz is our leader.
GID00027701	You're the one who saved us! Thank you.
GID00027702	I heard you talking to Horowitz, and can't thank you enough for what you've done for us.
GID00027703	I hope everyone on the surface is like you.
GID00027704	We're in your debt. Thank you, outlander.
GID00027705	I wish we were back at our Vault.
GID00027706	The surface world is a cruel place.
GID00027707	Why are you people treating us like this?
GID00027708	We're heading back home. I hope our troops do the same. This land can't be saved.
GID00027709	Trying to grow crops in this heat, with so little water, is bad enough, but now we've got radiation seeping into the farmlands east of New Vegas.
GID00027710	We're done. Let the people of these hell-hole deal with their problems, I say.
GID00027711	I can't wait to get back to NCR lands.
GID00027712	All our work was for nothing.
GID00027713	We should've never come here.
GID00027714	Good riddance, Mojave.
GID00027715	Thank you for coming, let's talk about that robot.
GID00027716	Have you given any more thought to my offer?
GID00027717	I'd like to talk to you about your robot. Bring it here and we can talk. I'm sure we can be of mutual benefit to each other.
GID00027718	Peace, traveler.
GID00027719	You again? What 'cha need, champ?
GID00027720	Unless you wanna slap leather with me you'll put that gun down, friend.
GID00027721	Hey there. Need anything?
GID00027722	If it isn't the courier who's done everything he can to defy the will of mighty Caesar!
GID00027723	If it isn't the courier who's done everything she can to defy the will of mighty Caesar!
GID00027724	The Legion holds Nelson, Profligate! This is where you'll die. Brothers, attack!
GID00027725	Have you come to Nelson seeking your death, Profligate?
GID00027726	I waited months to get in here, but the place isn't nearly full. You think the waiting list is just for hype?
GID00027727	The food here is to die for. No one cooks Brahmin like Philippe.
GID00027728	The torching is Philippe's idea. Brilliant, no?
GID00027729	Keep away from me, if you know what's good for you.
GID00027730	You look positively famished. We simply can't have that.
GID00027731	Welcome to Top Shelf. The drinks cost twice as much during happy hour, but they draw twice the attention, too.
GID00027732	What can I get you?
GID00027733	What's this about the White Glove Society?
GID00027734	You got me my boy back. I got no words.
GID00027735	Now... I hope you didn't do no harm to whoever's responsible for this. I wanna skin their hides myself.
GID00027736	You got a lot of nerve sticking around here. If I didn't have better things to do I'd thump your skull for what you said.
GID00027737	Tell me good news.
GID00027738	Ted, where are you, boy?
GID00027739	Beg your pardon, stranger, but I'm looking for someone. You ain't seen a young man with dark brown hair and a white hat on lately, have you?
GID00027740	You ain't heard anything about my boy, have you?
GID00027741	You done right by me. I appreciate it.
GID00027742	Oh- oh my. How unfortunate! And in front of all these people, too.
GID00027743	He always was a bit of a pill, Mortimer. He was so pouty when I decided to ban eating people. And now this.
GID00027744	I should've paid more attention to the warning signs.
GID00027745	Can you imagine what people would've said? Why, it would've been a complete scandal if it weren't for you.
GID00027746	To think, Mr. Gunderson, a cold-blooded murderer. It's simply chilling.
GID00027747	But his arrest ought to instill faith in our patrons that murderers are not welcome to gamble here.
GID00027748	What a disaster! An important person dead in my hotel.
GID00027749	Now people will confuse us with Gomorrah. The idea!
GID00027750	So glad you could be here tonight. I had hoped you would join us.
GID00027751	Welcome to the Ultra-Luxe. I do hope it exceeds your every expectation.
GID00027752	You double-crossing snake! I have nothing to say to someone so lowly and ill-mannered.
GID00027753	I wanted Mr. Gunderson out of the way, not slaughtered in my hotel! Our business is concluded. Good day!
GID00027754	You've done enough!
GID00027755	Mark my words. I'll have you filleted for this.
GID00027756	Ah, you're back. You're always a welcome guest here.
GID00027757	Any word as to our arrangement?
GID00027758	What the- ? Who is this trespasser?
GID00027759	How may I be of service, sir?
GID00027760	How may I be of service, madam?
GID00027761	Who are you?
GID00027762	You'll have to excuse me. There's somewhere I need to be right now.
GID00027763	Good day.
GID00027764	Leave me alone. Haven't you done enough?
GID00027765	Why are you standing still? Do you think that the world waits for you while you you stand there drooling? Get back out there and get to work!
GID00027766	Can't you see I'm busy?
GID00027767	I thought I told you to get lost.
GID00027768	Why are you standing still? Do you think that the world waits for you while you you stand there drooling? Get back out there and get to work!
GID00027769	How may I assist?
GID00027770	Come on, move it.
GID00027771	My daddy's gonna kill all you bastards once he finds out what you done to me.
GID00027772	You know, if you knew what you were doing I coulda been out of there hours ago.
GID00027773	Beg your pardon, but could I trouble you to turn over your weapons?
GID00027774	You! What do you think you're doing?
GID00027775	The sooner you find yourself elsewhere, the better.
GID00027776	Outrageous what Mortimer did. The nerve of some people.
GID00027777	Oh, Mortimer. You always had the gift of gaffe.
GID00027778	Usually we punish people who come in here uninvited. But you've made such a splash, we don't have the heart.
GID00027779	Your theatrics were just priceless. I salute you.
GID00027780	Mortimer's vision was absolutely inspired.
GID00027781	Now it can truly be said that not only to we dress better than anyone, we eat better as well.
GID00027782	I supported Mortimer from the beginning.
GID00027783	Of course cannibalism is civilized! It's all a matter of perspective.
GID00027784	I am at your service.
GID00027785	Have you been inside our bathhouse? The salts in the water work to balance the bodily humors.
GID00027786	To eat at the Gourmand is to spoil the palate. I can't bring myself to eat anywhere else.
GID00027787	Did you see Heck Gunderson the brahmin baron at the bar? He may be a wastelander, but his taste clearly befits his status.
GID00027788	Certainly you can buy the same drinks more cheaply elsewhere, but the point of drinking at Top Shelf isn't the liquor. It's the prestige.
GID00027789	Marjorie has done a remarkable job managing the restoration of this place, wouldn't you agree?
GID00027790	Our executive chef Philippe is the toast of New Vegas. His Brahmin Wellington is absolutely sublime.
GID00027791	You watch yourself around Mr. Gunderson.
GID00027792	Keep your distance. Who are you, and what do you want?
GID00027793	It smells so good in here. Like the air is cleaner than it is outside.
GID00027794	I heard they brought in sea salts from California just for this bath.
GID00027795	I'm so relaxed. Too bad I can't stay longer. But who can, at these prices?
GID00027796	Have you been in the steam room yet? It's just off to the side there. You can feel your aches just melt away.
GID00027797	Every evening most of the White Glove Society sneaks away somewhere. It's probably just for show.
GID00027798	I'm in Heaven. I haven't had a meal like this in... well... ever, really.
GID00027799	Philippe has outdone himself again.
GID00027800	For the price of this meal I could buy a whole Brahmin. But I'd never make that trade.
GID00027801	Hey, any idea how somebody gets into the White Glove Society? Have to know somebody?
GID00027802	They must've spent a fortune renovating this place.
GID00027803	I love the masks. It's like being at a fancy ball.
GID00027804	I'm not really gambling. I'm just hoping to be seen here. People will think I'm rich.
GID00027805	I've heard you have to make reservations at the Gourmand years in advance.
GID00027806	Those masks make me nervous. Is there something wrong with their faces?
GID00027807	There are a lot of rumors going around about the White Glove Society. I heard they used to be tribals.
GID00027808	Top Shelf is the premiere bar on the Strip. The drinks are overpriced, but that's the whole point.
GID00027809	<bark! bark!>
GID00027810	<growl...>
GID00027811	<aroo!>
GID00027812	<whimper>
GID00027813	<happy bark!>
GID00027814	<pant pant pant>
GID00027815	Like I said, I needed to go do something. This is it. It belonged to my father.
GID00027816	Since you convinced me to help out with the defense of Hoover Dam, I figured I'd haul it out of storage.
GID00027817	I'm a little rusty with it but... I think I can manage. As long as you've got my back, of course.
GID00027818	Like I said, I needed to go do something. This is it. It belonged to my father.
GID00027819	I thought I might wear it at Hoover Dam, but after you talked me out of it, I didn't see the point in hanging on to it any longer.
GID00027820	I'm here because of you, so I figure you're the one most deserving of it. It should protect you from everything short of a Plasma Caster.
GID00027821	And if you need anything - anything at all - you know where to find me.
GID00027822	Hey there. Was it always your plan to sell me into slavery to Caesar, or was that a spur of the moment thing?
GID00027823	Why don't you make like Odysseus and get lost?
GID00027824	For as lack of adornment is said to become some women, so will this place, without your presence, bring delight.
GID00027825	I've run out of witty ways to tell you to leave, so why don't you just go?
GID00027826	If you want to talk, take off that ridiculous Legion uniform. It's insulting.
GID00027827	Hi. If you're looking for medical help, try the other doctors. I'm just a researcher. Not even a particularly good one.
GID00027828	Hello, again. Still in one piece, I see.
GID00027829	What's up?
GID00027830	Well, we've had some laughs, you and I, but it looks like you're a crazy person and I'm going to have to leave.
GID00027831	Moreno took the fall of the Enclave hard. He never questioned his orders, never questioned the legitimacy of what the Enclave was doing.
GID00027832	To him, it was all one unbroken chain, from Washington to Richardson. When we left Navarro, I remember looking up at Moreno.
GID00027833	He said, "Kiss America goodbye, boys." When we left the Enclave behind, the love in him burned itself out. Now there's just a bitter old man left.
GID00027834	Since my mother died, Daisy's been the only woman in my life. She was the only other woman close to my father, too.
GID00027835	She flew him out on over a dozen missions, including his last. I've always been close to Daisy.
GID00027836	There have been some good men along the way, but lovers make poor confidants. Daisy never had children of her own, so she was always there to listen.
GID00027837	Being in the Enclave didn't mean much to her. She just loved to fly. It broke her heart to be grounded.
GID00027838	Doc Henry always was a hard one to figure out. It didn't seem to matter whether he was working with humans or dogs.
GID00027839	He had an equal lack of affection for both. A regular Diogenes. I'm not sure what the man was after.
GID00027840	"Knowledge is power," but to what end for Henry, I have no idea. The problem was what mattered to him, not its practical impact.
GID00027841	He simply solved riddles because they existed.
GID00027842	If I had to pick anyone who didn't belong in the Enclave, it would definitely be Johnson. He hated what the Enclave was doing.
GID00027843	Day to day, week to week, he would question orders, subvert mission objectives, do anything he could to serve without serving.
GID00027844	It's amazing he was never court-martialed. He always had good things to say about my father. Said I was like him in a lot of ways. I wish I knew.
GID00027845	Judah Kreger is the glue that's kept us all together over the years, and with good reason.
GID00027846	Anyone who can command Moreno and Johnson in the same unit without somebody getting fragged is one hell of a leader.
GID00027847	Kreger was polite and kind, but never warm. He always did his best to make me feel welcome in the group.
GID00027848	I think he did it out of a sense of loyalty to my father. Loyalty means a lot to Judah.
GID00027849	Not loyalty to the Enclave, or even the ideals they fought for, but to the people who served with him.
GID00027850	I'd like to say that I saw this coming, but honestly I was oblivious. For what it's worth, I'll do what I can to help you... not get killed?
GID00027851	So Mr. House doesn't care that one of Caesar's most notorious Legion spies is walking around on the Strip.
GID00027852	Either that or his Securitrons' AI is too primitive to recognize the threat. Neither answer is particularly comforting.
GID00027853	Oh, hello Emily. Yes, it is I, Arcade Gannon, fellow member of the Followers of the Apocalypse.
GID00027854	Would I like to help infiltrate the Lucky 38? I'm so glad you asked...
GID00027855	That's a lot of energy weapons. Brings back some interesting memories.
GID00027856	The Strip's not a bad place if you love terrible things and people. I'll never understand the allure of giving away your money to the rich.
GID00027857	I've read about REPCONN. I think they did some work with the... the government before the war. Rockets and some energy weapon prototypes, I think.
GID00027858	Westside, huh? I passed through here with another Follower a while back, Anderson. The locals were having a lot of trouble getting water through.
GID00027859	Westside, huh? I heard about what happened with Anderson. Can't say I'm surprised. He was always a fringe operator in the Followers.
GID00027860	What's wrong with you? Killing Anderson isn't going to bring Corporal White back.
GID00027861	Interesting way of handling things. Very sub rosa.
GID00027862	I don't know if the Scorpions deserved to be wiped out for something they didn't do, but that's one less problem Westside has to deal with.
GID00027863	Anderson turned in for the wrong reason and Westside gets to keep siphoning water.
GID00027864	It's hard to find justice in all of this, but I suppose this is as close as it gets. Thanks.
GID00027865	Extortion? Really? You go through all of this only to extort the people who are trying to help Westside? Unbelievable.
GID00027866	Hildern is a good example of "big picture" obsession gone too far.
GID00027867	At some point he became so fixated on large scale results that he lost the concept of "the common good" along the way.
GID00027868	It's an inhumane kind of public service when people and the basic resources they need become numbers in a ledger.
GID00027869	A vertibird. Interesting. It's been a long time since I've seen one of these.
GID00027870	Wait, wait, wait a second. What's going on? Am I playing Vergil to your Dante?
GID00027871	I'd like to assume that we're tiptoeing into the mouth of hell out of academic curiosity, but I'm not so open-minded that I've lost my brains.
GID00027872	I guess I'll wait out here, then.
GID00027873	I need to talk to you about something, if you have a minute.
GID00027874	Thanks for doing this, getting them all back together again.
GID00027875	I'll be honest, when Moreno started going off, I didn't think we'd all be walking out of there in one piece.
GID00027876	I still don't know how this is all going to shake out in the end, but at least the Enclave can atone a bit for all the damage it's done.
GID00027877	I shouldn't be surprised at what happened with Moreno. I hoped that after all this time, he could put his anger behind him.
GID00027878	Maybe everything good in Orion Moreno died at Navarro and it was foolish to think there was anything in him left to salvage.
GID00027879	You got the survivors of the Enclave back together so you could convince them to help Caesar?!
GID00027880	What are you thinking? Do you want to see Vegas turned into the new slave capital of the west?
GID00027881	Hey. You're your own person and all that, but you're acting crazy, and if you keep it up, I'm going to leave.
GID00027882	I like how you handled that. Nicely done.
GID00027883	I can't say that's how I would have handled that, but...
GID00027884	You're that courier, right? The guy who runs the Tops, Benny... heard he tried to kill you.
GID00027885	I guess that didn't work out very well for him. Should I watch my back around you?
GID00027886	Oh, you're that courier, aren't you? The one who got mixed up with Benny over at the Tops. Sounds like messy business.
GID00027887	I'm no botanist, but I think this may not be entirely natural.
GID00027888	Nuclear waste disposal. Pre-War, people figured there was so much desert in Nevada, you might as well turn it into a big dumping ground.
GID00027889	People didn't like it, but they weren't about to give up easy access to power, not with all of the petroleum drying up.
GID00027890	It's a shame what happened up here. I understand arguments about the "fog of war", but that can't be much consolation to the survivors.
GID00027891	Or to the NCR soldiers who have to live with what they did here.
GID00027892	In case it's not obvious, I think you should redirect the power to Freeside and outer Vegas.
GID00027893	You activated ARCHIMEDES?! What the hell are you thinking?!
GID00027894	Nicely done. I'm sure people will appreciate the power. I hate to have to rely on it, but out here... it makes a big difference.
GID00027895	Hmm. I suppose an even distribution is better than nothing.
GID00027896	Everything to the Strip and McCarran? Are you kidding?
GID00027897	I guess I should be grateful you didn't activate the laser.
GID00027898	You have to hand it to the NCR. Get enough hands working together and they can make or break just about anything.
GID00027899	I'm not exactly a mercenary, but taking out scumbags of this magnitude wouldn't cause me to lose any sleep.
GID00027900	Well, I'll be. Hoover Dam. One of the last remaining functioning wonders of the Pre-War world.
GID00027901	I'm amazed it's still running at all. Too bad everyone's killing each other over it.
GID00027902	What a load of Brahmin shit! Can you believe that guy?
GID00027903	<groan>
GID00027904	<grunt>
GID00027905	NCR military transmissions say the robots on the Strip have been upgraded. Wish we had eyes-on intel...
GID00027906	Mr. House is out of the picture. Probably killed by his own robots.
GID00027907	I heard you took out Caesar by yourself. Proves the Legion is just a bunch of savages, like we thought.
GID00027908	With their leader gone, the Legion will likely tear itself apart. It's what most violent tribal societies do.
GID00027909	NCR military radio keeps talking about Mr. House agreeing to join the NCR. What changed his mind?
GID00027910	Someone blew up the monorail the NCR uses to travel to the Strip and back. We should use this time to strike!
GID00027911	Seems the destruction of the monorail didn't slow the NCR down much. How many troops do they have?
GID00027912	There's a rumor going around that you saved the NCR president's life. I'm surprised you have the stones to show your face around here.
GID00027913	There was an attempt on the NCR president's life recently. Too bad it didn't succeed.
GID00027914	Were you the one who killed the NCR president? I'd like to shake your hand!
GID00027915	Did you hear? Someone actually managed to assassinate the NCR's president! And we just sit here!
GID00027916	The other day I heard some bigwig in the NCR military died. Hopefully it disrupts their chain of command some.
GID00027917	Did you hear about that NCR higher up that died? That he was trying to sabotage them? Hope he wasn't the only one.
GID00027918	Seems the NCR is making friends. We've had reports of them making overtures to some gang in Freeside.
GID00027919	We just had word that the town of Primm is now part of the NCR. At this rate, they'll be running the whole region soon.
GID00027920	I heard some special squad of Rangers is on its way to the Vegas area. I guess the NCR is finally getting serious about fighting the Legion.
GID00027921	There've been reports that the NCR is moving more and more troops into the area.
GID00027922	It's the quiet before the storm up top. For once I'm almost glad we're down here.
GID00027923	Keep an eye on Veronica here. She's a sharp one.
GID00027924	Try to keep Veronica out of trouble, would you?
GID00027925	If you're planning to take Veronica with you, be sure to have a good pair of earplugs with you. I'm kidding, Veronica! Put the power fist down!
GID00027926	What a fascinating animal. I'm sure the scribes will want to take a look at him.
GID00027927	Is that a Mk. III Support Model you have with you? I've seen references to them, but never with my own eyes. I imagine he makes a great pet.
GID00027928	Where did you get that Eyebot? I've never seen one modified quite like that.
GID00027929	Keep that mutant in line, or we'll put it down.
GID00027930	Oh good, now I have to put up with the stench of rotting ghoul as well. I hope the air filters are working.
GID00027931	I've heard that your friend there can put some of the senior scribes to shame.
GID00027932	Why is your friend there glaring at me like that? Did I bump into him or something?
GID00027933	Don't bother me. I'm on patrol.
GID00027934	Hello, outsider.
GID00027935	I've important work to do, so no time to talk.
GID00027936	Does Ramos know you're walking around without a guard?
GID00027937	Keep up the good work, outsider.
GID00027938	I hear you've been making yourself useful. Unlike some people I could mention.
GID00027939	Are you adjusting to the bunker, outsider?
GID00027940	Just between you and me, I'm glad you're here. This place needed a fresh face.
GID00027941	You've been a great help, outsider. Thank you for all your hard work.
GID00027942	Greetings, out- excuse me, I guess I need to stop calling you that, don't I?
GID00027943	So you're one of us now, eh? Truly it is a rare honor.
GID00027944	Oh, it's you.
GID00027945	I'd rather not talk to you, outsider.
GID00027946	I'd rather not associate with you. Excuse me.
GID00027947	Why the Elder didn't just have you shot is beyond me.
GID00027948	Don't talk to me. You've caused more than enough damage.
GID00027949	Ramos is keeping an eye on you, outsider. Remember that.
GID00027950	You certainly make life more interesting, outsider.
GID00027951	Some of the others may look the other way, but I don't trust you.
GID00027952	You're going to have to clean up your act if you want some respect around here, outsider.
GID00027953	Just when I think I've got you figured out, you go and surprise me.
GID00027954	I don't trust you, outsider, but I can't help but like you.
GID00027955	You're alright, outsider. Most of the time, anyway.
GID00027956	I have two hours of weapons training every morning. It is a good way to start the day.
GID00027957	Hardin is a tough man, but fair. I'd follow him into battle any day.
GID00027958	There are whispers that McNamara's lost his nerve. I can't believe that, not after what he did at HELIOS One.
GID00027959	How long before we resume normal patrols?
GID00027960	After the battle at HELIOS One, some people were worried about the NCR coming after us, but this bunker is secure.
GID00027961	Ramos runs a tight ship. We haven't had an incident in over a year. Your arrival excluded, of course.
GID00027962	Hardin will be Elder soon, mark my words.
GID00027963	Why are we hiding down here? We should be avenging our fallen brothers!
GID00027964	HELIOS will be ours again someday.
GID00027965	When are these night missions going to end?
GID00027966	Ugh, more VR training. Maybe I'll hit the shooting range instead.
GID00027967	Maintaining the machinery around here is important. We have to breathe, after all.
GID00027968	After this I have some weapons to repair.
GID00027969	If I do a good job, I might be up for promotion to Paladin soon.
GID00027970	Power armor is pretty intricately made. It's not an easy thing to fix.
GID00027971	Have you seen the dust storm above? I worked on that machine!
GID00027972	If it's not broken power armor, it's broken electrical fixtures.
GID00027973	If it's not broken weapons, it's broken power armor.
GID00027974	I'm really busy now, sorry.
GID00027975	I don't think these repairs will ever end.
GID00027976	Our early test results look promising.
GID00027977	I heard the Elder's got Taggart working on some kind of secret project.
GID00027978	Every day we come one step closer to reclaiming the glory of the past.
GID00027979	Even though the patrols no longer go out, we've got a backlog of devices that require investigation.
GID00027980	Why is it so important that we research night vision optics?
GID00027981	I'd kill to go outside and gather some specimens.
GID00027982	Everyone says I'm crazy, but I still say it'd be a great advancement if doors opened once you got close to them.
GID00027983	The loss of HELIOS was terrible, but this bunker is a wonder of its own.
GID00027984	If we could just combine the best qualities of laser and plasma weaponry...
GID00027985	It pains me to think of the scientific wonders at HELIOS One, now in NCR hands.
GID00027986	But if I adjust the magnetic field, perhaps the resulting change in wavelength will- excuse me, I'm merely thinking out loud.
GID00027987	We have a duty to preserve the past.
GID00027988	Only a few people get to venture outside, usually to trade for food.
GID00027989	You've been outside. Is the NCR really still hunting us?
GID00027990	McNamara's done a pretty good job, given the situation he was handed.
GID00027991	Our former Elder, Elijah, was obsessed with new technology. That's why we were at HELIOS in the first place.
GID00027992	Hardin owes his life to McNamara. That's why he won't challenge him outright.
GID00027993	As much as I'm sick of Taggart's VR sims, I have to admit we wouldn't be combat ready without them.
GID00027994	Doc Schuler is a lifesaver. I was hurt in training the other day and she fixed me right up.
GID00027995	The Lucky 38's reactor has been restarted... it can be seen from miles away.
GID00027996	Sharing knowledge with an outsider organization. I knew Veronica couldn't be trusted.
GID00027997	We tracked your movements a long way. But it was worth it to catch her in the act.
GID00027998	Passing Brotherhood secrets to outsiders is the lowest form of treason. What have you got to say for yourself?
GID00027999	We heard Veronica talking with the Elder. We won't stand for this.
GID00028000	What is this? Veronica brings an outsider into our home, then has a private audience with the Elder?
GID00028001	The two of you may have the Elder fooled, but we know better.
GID00028002	Veronica has always twisted the Founder's principles to her own ends. We will not stand idly by and allow her to corrupt our Elder's thinking.
GID00028003	This had better be good. You have a lot to answer for.
GID00028004	What can the Followers of the Apocalypse do for you today?
GID00028005	Welcome to the New Vegas Medical Clinic. I'm a fully qualified physician and can fix whatever is wrong with you for a reasonable fee.
GID00028006	If you've got the caps, I've also got several implants available to enhance your physical attributes.
GID00028007	You're back. Do you need medical attention?
GID00028008	I'm just security, not a doctor.
GID00028009	A customer! Not many people come into Boulder City these days.
GID00028010	Howdy, trooper. I thought the Big Horn was off limits to you guys, but who am I to complain? A customer is a customer.
GID00028011	Surprising that the Khans are going to walk out of here after all that fuss.
GID00028012	Guess those Khans got what was coming to them, huh?
GID00028013	Hope those Great Khans don't come trash my saloon. I'm not part of the NCR!
GID00028014	Welcome back to the Big Horn. What can I get you?
GID00028015	Kill every last one of those NCR troopers and then we'll talk.
GID00028016	What the hell? You're that courier Benny wasted back in Goodsprings. You're supposed to be dead.
GID00028017	I'm getting real tired of talking.
GID00028018	Still got a bit of a walk ahead of us. Talk fast.
GID00028019	We've got a situation with some Great Khans right now. The brass at McCarran has ordered me to lock down the ruins until it's been resolved.
GID00028020	Can't talk. We didn't get all the Great Khans yet.
GID00028021	Where do you think you're going? I can't let you go into the ruins, not without a reason.
GID00028022	How are negotiations with the Great Khans going?
GID00028023	I'm glad you were able to get my people freed, but there's a new problem. I just got orders to take out the Great Khans, hostages or not.
GID00028024	When I heard the shots, I figured your negotiation went bad. What the hell happened?
GID00028025	The Great Khans can go, just as we agreed.
GID00028026	Ackerman and Gilbert aren't back yet. What's the holdup?
GID00028027	Thanks for getting both of my people out of there.
GID00028028	I'm sorry that you couldn't get both hostages out alive, but that's how it goes sometimes. Thanks for your help.
GID00028029	I'm sorry that you couldn't get either hostage out alive, but that's how it goes sometimes. Thanks for your help.
GID00028030	I really don't have the time to chatter right now.
GID00028031	Thanks for the rescue.
GID00028032	Man, I thought I was dead for sure.
GID00028033	Thanks for getting me out of there. I owe you one.
GID00028034	I'm glad that's over. Thank you.
GID00028035	You here to pay your respects, too?
GID00028036	Hello again. Is there something you need from me?
GID00028037	What the fuck are you doing? My brother died at the Battle of Hoover Dam. You're desecrating a war memorial.
GID00028038	I've got nothing else to say to you.
GID00028039	If you're down on your luck and need some caps, I buy just about anything. Of course, I've also got plenty of things for sale, too.
GID00028040	Here to do business?
GID00028041	Howdy. Name's Bob, but folks around here call me Klamath Bob. What can I do you for?
GID00028042	Hey, stranger. Hope you been well. What do you need?
GID00028043	Nng. Hi.
GID00028044	Nng. Hi again.
GID00028045	Hi there. Welcome to the Westside Co-op. I'm Clayton Ettienne. Let me know if you have any questions.
GID00028046	Welcome back. How can I help you?
GID00028047	Uh... hi.
GID00028048	Oh, hello.
GID00028049	Agh! I wasn't doing anything!
GID00028050	Hello again.
GID00028051	Leave me alone.
GID00028052	Hey, you got a second?
GID00028053	I'd slap him around, but he stood at my parents' wedding.
GID00028054	Plus he used to make excuses to get me out of my punishment when I'd slept through Head Scribe Taggart's lectures. Figure I owe him for that.
GID00028055	<Sighs> He means well.
GID00028056	I'd be angrier with him, but it's hard to stay mad at the guy who taught me how to box when all the other Paladins told me no.
GID00028057	<Sighs> He always does what he feels is right. Usually that's a great quality.
GID00028058	Let's see what we've got here... Okay, yeah, this is the one I was thinking of. The pulse gun.
GID00028059	Although maybe the rangefinder could work too. And it looks like the NCR was onto some miracle farming technology.
GID00028060	He wouldn't listen. The truth was right there staring him in the face. How could he not listen?
GID00028061	God. I should get used to this, I guess. People get desperate, they turn on each other. First thing to go is trust.
GID00028062	I don't think it's ever gonna be the same for me in there. Knowing no matter what I do, it's gonna end badly.
GID00028063	But they're all I have.
GID00028064	God, I did this. This was my fault. Why didn't I see this coming?
GID00028065	Of course they'd track me. Of course they'd assume the worst. Sure, I left them. But that didn't mean I'd ever be free of them.
GID00028066	I should've known I was beaten before I began. I just... I had to try, you know?
GID00028067	Well, if there was any question whether I should leave, I guess there's my answer.
GID00028068	Why did you do that? They were going to let us walk away. Why did you attack them?
GID00028069	I don't care that they started it. What you did was inexcusable. You need to go.
GID00028070	Clearly you're determined to fight the Brotherhood. Well, you can add my name to your hit list because you're on your own.
GID00028071	Okay, listen. The Brotherhood... they're not always the friendliest bunch. But I won't stand for you fighting them.
GID00028072	This is your last chance.
GID00028073	See? Pretty addictive, right? You do it once, it just makes you want to do it more.
GID00028074	You can't help but notice that the Brotherhood barely exists to these people out here. We're like an urban myth. No real presence on the Outside.
GID00028075	We just don't adapt like we should. Used to be that all you needed to get your way was a suit of power armor and a laser rifle.
GID00028076	Now... people are armed and organized. They're not afraid. But we still stick to our old approach, because it's all we know.
GID00028077	You know, I've been thinking. The real problem with the Brotherhood is that we isolate ourselves.
GID00028078	Our training is top-notch, our technology gives us an advantage, but when it all comes down to it, we're losing because we shun the outside world.
GID00028079	We always make enemies, never allies. We refuse to recruit outsiders, or see the value in their simpler technologies.
GID00028080	Hold on. I see something I want to punch.
GID00028081	No offense, but you look like you've traveled a long way down some bad roads. Where'd you come from?
GID00028082	Couldn't get enough of talking to me the first time, huh?
GID00028083	Listen... I want to thank you for helping me out. I'm sorry that... things didn't go like I'd hoped.
GID00028084	But at least I got the chance to try. At least I know for sure that there was nothing I could do.
GID00028085	Thank you for giving me that chance.
GID00028086	Wow, Mr. House is looking for you, huh? What do you think he wants? Bowling partner?
GID00028087	What'd you think of Mr. House? I was surprised he only had the two robot sex slaves.
GID00028088	That chip of yours... I wouldn't wager it on blackjack.
GID00028089	Unless the dealer has a five or six showing.
GID00028090	Whole future of New Vegas seems like it's up in the air. Guess I should wait things out before buying a condo in the Ultra-Luxe, huh?
GID00028091	Hope you're picking the winning side here. Be nice to fight for someone who's gonna be around for a while.
GID00028092	Next stop, Hoover Dam, huh? When we get there... can we stop by the souvenir shop? Their beaver mascot is just precious.
GID00028093	What's up?
GID00028094	Who the fuck are you?
GID00028095	Shut up and keep going.
GID00028096	I don't know where the hell you're going but it's not the right way. Are you still in this?
GID00028097	What do you want now?

GID00028103	Hang on there, traveler. You'll want to steer clear of this place - the whole town is irradiated to high hell.
GID00028104	How are you coming with the dog tags?

GID00028110	Who the hell are you? Better yet, what the hell are you doing in this cursed place?
GID00028111	You know what? Forget it, it doesn't matter. Welcome to Camp Searchlight, the shittiest place on earth.
GID00028112	Yeah?

GID00028114	<Questions for Edwards>
GID00028115	<Arachnophobia Quest Stuff>
GID00028116	Hold up! There are Deathclaws all over the damn place north of here. I'd turn back if I were you.
GID00028117	If you want to get to New Vegas, you're better off heading east from Primm and then looping north. It's a heck of a lot safer.
GID00028118	Can't believe anyone actually made it through from the north, what with all the Deathclaws at the quarry. You returning from New Vegas?
GID00028119	You need something?
GID00028120	Let me ask you a question - what's the tastiest thing you've ever eaten?
GID00028121	This is incredibly good. Here's your omelet, and the recipe if you ever want to make your own. It takes a bit of skill to get it tasting right.
GID00028122	Hey there. What's new?
GID00028123	That's close enough. What do you want with the Great Khans?
GID00028124	Nice outfit, but I know you're not one of us. What do you want with the Great Khans?
GID00028125	What do you want now?
GID00028126	How's it going?
GID00028127	Hey, hey. What can Tyrone do for you?
GID00028128	I had an amazing time with you. You can look me up any time, baby.
GID00028129	Hey, hey. You're back.
GID00028130	<whuff>
GID00028131	<snuffle!>
GID00028132	What is it, trooper? You're not assigned to my squad, as far as I know.
GID00028133	I'm not a recruitment officer. If you want to join the army, I'm sure someone at McCarran can point you in the right direction.
GID00028134	What is it?
GID00028135	Hey, I'm just a farmer. I don't want any trouble and I don't have anything valuable.
GID00028136	Howdy. Something I can help you with?
GID00028137	Our water ration suddenly increased. Can't help but think that you had something to do with it.
GID00028138	You showed up just in time to say goodbye. Me and couple of the others are packing it in and heading back to California.
GID00028139	The water ration's still a problem, and the NCR doesn't look like it's going to do anything about it anytime soon.
GID00028140	Something else you need before I go?
GID00028141	Howdy. Something else I can help you with?
GID00028142	Is there something I can do for you?
GID00028143	RL-3 regrets to inform that you are obviously unfit to command, sir!
GID00028144	RL-3 is pleased to see you, sir! Is there a mission to undertake?
GID00028145	RL-3 is ready for another tour of duty, sir!
GID00028146	RL-3 is ready for duty, sir!
GID00028147	Yes, commander?
GID00028148	By your command, sir!
GID00028149	I've lost all respect for you.
GID00028150	If you're an enemy of the NCR, you're an enemy of mine. Get out of my sight.
GID00028151	Goddamn it! Don't sneak up on me like that. What do you want?
GID00028152	Hey. You. You wandered into town recently, right?
GID00028153	Get the hell away! We're done talking.
GID00028154	You shouldn't be here. If people know we talked, they'll suspect you.
GID00028155	And if whoever did this smells a rat, they'll have the Legion after both of us.
GID00028156	That's it, then. How did you know?
GID00028157	If there's one thing I won't tolerate, it's working with some dog of the Legion. You've got some explaining to do.
GID00028158	I told you I wouldn't work against the NCR. I meant it.
GID00028159	I'm out of here.
GID00028160	Still helping the Legion. You're gonna get what's coming to you. I promise you that.
GID00028161	We're through working together.
GID00028162	Look, I know the NCR has problems, but I fought with those men. I'll be damned before I betray them.
GID00028163	This stops right now.
GID00028164	Yeah?
GID00028165	No offense, but I need to focus on getting more rest when I'm off duty. I'm not sleeping so good. So now's not a good time.
GID00028166	If you want to talk, catch me when I'm on duty. I'm up in the dinosaur after 9 pm.
GID00028167	Nice of you to show up.
GID00028168	Is it time?
GID00028169	Let's get out of this first.
GID00028170	We take this boat, it's probably the last one we ever take.
GID00028171	I'm ready for that. Are you?
GID00028172	We're near a Legion slave camp now. I've... been here before.
GID00028173	Let's get one thing straight. I see any crimson, I'm taking the shot. You don't like that, you're on your own.
GID00028174	We're getting close to Nelson. Any closer, I'm shooting any legionary I see. Hope that's not a problem.
GID00028175	Huh. We made it through after all. Not sure what to make of that.
GID00028176	Mercy killing is expected of NCR snipers. The Legion likes to torture their prisoners within sight of NCR positions.
GID00028177	We get called on to end it. I've had my share. Some of them, you think, maybe you could've gotten them out.
GID00028178	Maybe it's not the Legion that got them killed. Maybe it's your orders and you following them.
GID00028179	Caesar's dead. Bet he didn't see this coming when he was having his coffee this morning.
GID00028180	Still. It's not gonna stop the Legion. Might not even slow them down.
GID00028181	Pisses me off that Legion slavers can just operate on NCR turf like that.
GID00028182	If we hadn't caught up to them they'd probably have had a clear path to the river. No one to stop them.
GID00028183	There should be patrols. Checkpoints. We got greedy, overstretched. Now our own territory isn't secure.
GID00028184	Something's wrong. Got a group coming our way. Looks like a Legion raiding party. It's big.
GID00028185	Might be too big. Even for us.
GID00028186	If you want out I won't blame you. But I'm going to stay. See if I can hold them off.
GID00028187	Hey. I thought some more about what you said. I think maybe you're right. Maybe I should go to Bitter Springs.
GID00028188	I don't know what I'm hoping to find there.
GID00028189	Hey. I want to thank you for bringing me to Bitter Springs. Things seem... clearer now.
GID00028190	We should get to the Hoover Dam. I don't want to miss this.
GID00028191	That guy Benny was a piece of work.
GID00028192	A face-to-face meeting with House, huh? The NCR would kill to be in your shoes.
GID00028193	Sounds like it's gonna be an all-out war with the Legion soon. Maybe I should've re-enlisted after all.
GID00028194	What is it?
GID00028195	Hi, REPCONN Quest Stuff, have at it!
GID00028196	Maybe that guy Fantastic wasn't an idiot. Maybe he was a genius.
GID00028197	Damn that was some light show out there.
GID00028198	That was blinding out there. Feels like I've been staring at the sun.
GID00028199	Is the plant actually working again?
GID00028200	I'm surprised they didn't send you somewhere more vital.
GID00028201	Wow, what are you doing at HELIOS? I feel like I should salute.
GID00028202	Hope you can stay. We could use your expertise here.
GID00028203	What'd you do wrong to get sent here? Thought you were an up-and-comer.
GID00028204	Are you supporting us here? We'll take what we can get.
GID00028205	Welcome to HELIOS One.
GID00028206	The attacks have stopped. Winning the dam saved our asses.
GID00028207	We lost Forlorn Hope. The eastern front is collapsing. They'll be here next.
GID00028208	Thank God we took back Nelson. Now they'll have a harder time hitting us here.
GID00028209	Heard the Brotherhood got smoked. Guess somebody finished what we started.
GID00028210	With Caesar dead, maybe they'll stop attacking us.
GID00028211	This chainlink fence perimeter is worthless. We might as well be defending a cage from the inside.
GID00028212	This place is off-limits to civilians. You don't like it, take it up with Lieutenant Haggerty.
GID00028213	The Legion's coming for us. Just a matter of time, believe you me.
GID00028214	Pretty sure H.Q. has forgotten all about us.
GID00028215	That scientist we hired has got to be the dumbest asshole I've ever come across.
GID00028216	Who knows which side the Legion's gonna hit us from next?
GID00028217	If the Legion breaks through our defenses, I got one bullet I'm saving just for me.
GID00028218	We should be up on the front lines, not out here in bumblefuck. This place is a junkyard.
GID00028219	We're supposed to be relieved any day. That's what they keep telling us. I don't think anyone's coming.
GID00028220	Hey man, when in Rome.
GID00028221	I look so good in this shit, I want you to call me Fucking Spectacular from now on.
GID00028222	Guess who got promoted to goddamn dam god? The cream always rises to the top, and Fantastic always rises to the top of the cream.
GID00028223	Well look who it is! Fantastic's little helper, all grown up. Following in his master's footsteps.
GID00028224	What the fuck, man? Are you loco?
GID00028225	You just killed my paycheck.
GID00028226	Who the hell are you? They bring you in to replace me? They're replacing me, aren't they?
GID00028227	Yo.
GID00028228	This is a restricted area. State your business.
GID00028229	What is it?
GID00028230	What have you done? Get away from me!
GID00028231	It's unusual to see a new face here. Are you a soldier, or a scientist?
GID00028232	Your organization will doom all of us.
GID00028233	What can I help you with?
GID00028234	First Recon is holding Forlorn Hope now. What I wouldn't give for sniper support here.
GID00028235	We don't even need this place. But it sure scares the shit out of the NCR that we've got a base here.
GID00028236	The NCR left its soldiers here to die. Must be their strategy for the whole war.
GID00028237	It was only a matter of time before HELIOS fell to us.
GID00028238	We will not lose this place again.
GID00028239	HELIOS One is safe in our hands and our hands alone.
GID00028240	Under NCR control, this place was a gun in the hands of a child.
GID00028241	Anders showed up here not too long ago. I'm told you're the one who got him out of the vault.
GID00028242	I can't tell you how relieved I am. Sending him on that mission was a mistake.
GID00028243	We're all impressed with the work you've done for us. I thought you might be able to make use of this.
GID00028244	It's a key to a little hideaway south of here. We've used it as a place for Rangers to rest and resupply. I thought you might get good use out of it.
GID00028245	I know who you are. I'm a patient man, but you'd better have a damn good reason to be standing here right now. Spit it out.
GID00028246	Look who it is. I haven't had the privilege, but I'm told you've been an angel on our shoulder. What can we do for you at Camp McCarran?
GID00028247	Well. I'm glad we could finally meet. My sources tell me you've done some good work for us. What brings you to Camp McCarran?
GID00028248	I'm usually good with faces, but I don't think I've seen you here before. What brings you to Camp McCarran?
GID00028249	What happened?
GID00028250	Yes, what is it?
GID00028251	What are you doing here? You don't have clearance.
GID00028252	Get the hell out of my sight.
GID00028253	Hey, what are you doing out here at this hour?
GID00028254	Trouble sleeping again, huh? Well, do yourself a favor - try and get some rest.
GID00028255	Following up on your lead, huh? Good. I'll get out of your way before I blow your cover.
GID00028256	I hope you catch this guy.
GID00028257	Nice to meet you. I'm Curtis.
GID00028258	Well?
GID00028259	What is it?
GID00028260	Hey! Can't you see I'm busy here?
GID00028261	Nah, I'm just kidding. This has to be the most worthless patrol duty on the whole base. They never attack this gate.
GID00028262	They just put me back here because they don't think I can handle anything else.
GID00028263	Man, am I bored.
GID00028264	Why don't you wait in the other room while I chat with Silus here?
GID00028265	What is it, soldier?
GID00028266	You stick out like a sore thumb around here. You sure you're in the right place?
GID00028267	You weren't supposed to kill him! Goddamn it. Not only did we not get any information, but now you've ended his suffering, too.
GID00028268	Shit, guess I can forget about a promotion this decade. Thanks a lot, asshole.
GID00028269	Fuck. What am I going to tell the colonel?
GID00028270	Haven't you done enough?
GID00028271	Poor guy. He's all tuckered out. Well, I guess we'll have to pick up where we left off tomorrow. Good work.
GID00028272	I'm sure he'll have had enough after a few days of this. Or if we're lucky, a few months.
GID00028273	I'll get someone in here to clean up the mess he made. You can head out for the day. Let's let him sleep.
GID00028274	That was fun to watch. I'd have you do it again, but I'd probably get in trouble.
GID00028275	This'll do the NCR a lot of good, so you should be proud.
GID00028276	Here's the standard fee, plus I threw in the price of a good show on the Strip. That's from me personally. You can beat up my prisoners anytime.
GID00028277	You did well. I don't know how you did it without putting a scratch on him, and I'm a little disappointed personally, but it saved the NCR some face.
GID00028278	And it could save us more than that when all is said and done. I'm gonna talk to some people when we're through here.
GID00028279	This is about double the standard fee we'd give a "consultant," but from what I saw, you're more of an artist. So think of this as your commission.
GID00028280	Let's finish this up, then we can talk.
GID00028281	You're back.
GID00028282	What an ugly little worm you are. What pile of excrement did the lieutenant pluck you from, worm?
GID00028283	What?
GID00028284	You don't have to do this.
GID00028285	You hit like a bedridden old woman.
GID00028286	We don't have anything to discuss, worm.
GID00028287	Enough! This is pointless. I'm dead to the Legion either way. I'll tell you what I know.
GID00028288	But you should know that Caesar has always kept his own counsel. He never reveals anything that would make him vulnerable.
GID00028289	My knowledge will not prevent the inevitable. This camp will be ash within months. Maybe weeks.
GID00028290	Have you got it?
GID00028291	Hit me.
GID00028292	Get away from me.
GID00028293	I'll take it from here.
GID00028294	Boyd's in there with a prisoner right now. Boy, is she pissed.
GID00028295	Hassling Hector, huh? Got a thing for little kids?
GID00028296	Howdy, pardner! Welcome to the headquarters of the Sunset Sarsaparilla Company. Wrangle up a stool and listen to ol' Festus jaw a while.
GID00028297	If you and ol' Festus are old pals, say a command now. Otherwise, say "Pleased to meetcha" and we'll get acquainted.
GID00028298	Or, if you have more important things to do than talk to ol' Festus, say "Goodbye".
GID00028299	Welcome to the headquarters of the Sunset Sarsaparilla Company!
GID00028300	Worker #27438 reporting! There seems to be a malfunction with the line, sir!
GID00028301	Wait a minute. You're not my manager! Intruder!
GID00028302	Hello there. It's good to see a friendly face. Almost took you for a raider, I did. Name's Malcolm. Malcolm Holmes.
GID00028303	Don't suppose you'd care to trade? I'm missing a few essentials and- oh, screw this. Lying just ain't in my nature.
GID00028304	I'll tell it to you straight. I've been following you for a good bit now.
GID00028305	Eh? You want to talk some more?
GID00028306	Thank god you came around. That guy was going to kill me!
GID00028307	Thanks for the help. That crazy bitch just attacked me out of nowhere.
GID00028308	Did you see that? That crazy bitch just attacked me out of nowhere.
GID00028309	Thanks again for the help.
GID00028310	This day just can't get any worse.
GID00028311	Did you see that? That guy was going to kill me!
GID00028312	Hey, it's you ag- what's wrong? Why are you looking at me like that?
GID00028313	Don't worry about me. I'm a little shaken up, but I'll be okay.
GID00028314	Could you, maybe, stay away from me? You're creeping me out.
GID00028315	Gotta wonder what the hell a civilian is doing here.
GID00028316	You from Camp Golf or McCarran? Never mind. Don't really care.
GID00028317	What do you want now?
GID00028318	I don't remember getting informed about any new transfers to this post.
GID00028319	This is a military post. You sure you're in the right place?
GID00028320	Is there something you need from me?
GID00028321	I'm not supposed to let civilians just walk around this place. There better be a good reason for you being here.
GID00028322	I'm pretty sure you're not authorized to be here, whatever unit you happen to be from. What do you want?
GID00028323	Why are you still here?
GID00028324	No sudden moves and you and I will do all right. What do you want?
GID00028325	Haven't seen you around the post before. I'm busy, so keep the chit-chat to the point.
GID00028326	Yeah?
GID00028327	I don't know what you did to pull runner duty to a post this far out in the wasteland, but you have my sympathies.
GID00028328	If you're here to sell something, we don't want any.
GID00028329	What's up?
GID00028330	You don't walk like any trooper I've ever seen, but I'll let it slide. What do you want?
GID00028331	What brings you to Ranger Station Bravo?
GID00028332	Something up?
GID00028333	Thank goodness you're here. My squad needs help.
GID00028334	You're the courier I've heard so much about. My squad needs your assistance.
GID00028335	So any word on my friends?
GID00028336	<Renolds Top Level Topics>
GID00028337	<Alexus Top Level Topics>
GID00028338	I'm glad to see a fellow trooper. My squad is in trouble.
GID00028339	Need something?
GID00028340	The Legion are trouble. You should watch out.
GID00028341	The road is dangerous. You better stay sharp.
GID00028342	I'm getting out of here.
GID00028343	Fuck this place.
GID00028344	The Legion will pay for this.
GID00028345	Well, well. If it isn't the courier who wiped out the Legion over at Nelson. Good to see you around the Hope.
GID00028346	Hold up there. This area is locked down by the NCR military until we can dislodge some Legion snakes from Nelson.
GID00028347	Me and Carmine - that's my repeater here - will do our best to cover you from this ridge. Good luck.
GID00028348	Let it wait until I've stopped running, all right?
GID00028349	Hold it right there, Courier. I been hearing things about you, and they ain't all been good.
GID00028350	Just so you know, you will answer to me if you cause any trouble for the troops around here. Things're bad enough as is.
GID00028351	You're always welcome around the Hope, Courier - least as far as I'm concerned.
GID00028352	Howdy. What's the word?
GID00028353	I can still hear our boys screaming down there.
GID00028354	Got to stay alert...
GID00028355	Just waiting here seems like a death sentence...
GID00028356	They've got our guys down there.
GID00028357	Fucking monsters butchered the miners down there...
GID00028358	Wish Renolds would report back soon... he went west a day ago, no word from him.
GID00028359	We need to move out, we can't hold this position.
GID00028360	Once the Legion's dug in, we're never getting them out of Nelson.
GID00028361	There used to be two commanders, but I only see one - the other must be nearby somewhere.
GID00028362	Won't be long before the Legion rolls out of Nelson...
GID00028363	Someone should go warn Novac.
GID00028364	We need reinforcements from Camp Forlorn Hope.
GID00028365	Wish we could do something for the troopers down there.
GID00028366	Out on regular patrol, then this shit goes down.
GID00028367	The Legion'll pay for Nelson.
GID00028368	Never thought Legion'd be bold enough to strike this far.
GID00028369	Told Milo we have to go, but he won't leave.
GID00028370	We can't hold this road if they come up through town!
GID00028371	Thanks for the help with the hostages!
GID00028372	I can't believe you broke into the mine and saved those miners.
GID00028373	Hope you made the Legion at the mine pay for Nelson.
GID00028374	The hostages are safe. We owe you.
GID00028375	You sure cleaned out the Legion in Nelson.
GID00028376	Legion'll think twice before crossing the river again.
GID00028377	Guess Caesar got his tribute after all.
GID00028378	Nelson'll turn this war around.
GID00028379	Let's see those fuckers attack Hoover Dam now.
GID00028380	Nelson's proof payback's a bitch.
GID00028381	Thanks for cleaning up Nelson!
GID00028382	Don't know what we would have done if you hadn't come along.
GID00028383	Wish more people had your kind of guts.
GID00028384	Go to hell.
GID00028385	I'm heading back West. You won't see me again.
GID00028386	God, there's almost nothing left. Looks like whoever it was - was just in the mood for killing.
GID00028387	Most of the cargo's ash, too - not burned, looks like... disintegrated. When I heard the reports, I assumed "ash" meant "burned."
GID00028388	So close to the Vegas wall, too, don't that beat all. Must have happened during the day, though, they hadn't made a camp.
GID00028389	You know what, what happened to my caravan - not the first time I've heard about an attack like that.
GID00028390	One of our caravans got hit back a few months back, and the caravan'd been burned, too, along with the cargo.
GID00028391	I wonder if he made the same mistake, and that other caravan got hit with energy weapons, too.
GID00028392	More energy weapons hit this caravan. Place has been picked clean.
GID00028393	This... is Brotherhood level murder here. But they don't do things like that. This was done with a purpose.
GID00028394	Let's poke around a bit, see what we can find. Might be something in the wreckage.
GID00028395	What's that? Looks like a map - got the route along the West of Vegas, and...
GID00028396	...they've marked another spot. Over here, along this stretch. That's fucked up - middle of nowhere.
GID00028397	Another caravan burned. Except someone made camp here - and I never heard about this attack.
GID00028398	Let's look around, something stinks.
GID00028399	That does it, that's all I need to know.
GID00028400	Crimson Caravan and the Van Graffs... they were behind burning these caravans, and they've got to answer for them.
GID00028401	I'm going to get some extra ammo, a few bottles of whiskey, then show them how Cassidys settle accounts.
GID00028402	Voices down, eyes up.
GID00028403	Keep your voice down, we got movement out there.
GID00028404	Save the sweettalk for when the shooting's done.
GID00028405	You and me we're done traveling together. I want nothing more to do with you.
GID00028406	I thought there was a chance you'd change - not any longer, being a fucker is who you are.
GID00028407	Guess my last warning didn't sink in too well. Things don't change, and soon, I'm gone.
GID00028408	You are such an asshole sometimes.
GID00028409	Look, maybe you were like this before I signed up with you, but if you keep acting this way, I'm not going to stick around much longer.
GID00028410	Are you fucking high right now? God, I can smell it from here. Keep that shit away from me.
GID00028411	Ready to leave yet? This place puts my teeth on edge.
GID00028412	Well, now, look what rolled in. What, you getting lonely out there?
GID00028413	If you say you're going to gather evidence, then kill the bitches anyway, at least tell me when you change your mind.
GID00028414	Now, if you're done fucking around, let's settle accounts the old-fashioned way.
GID00028415	Just trimmed the Van Graff family tree, I think Freeside'll breathe a little easier now.
GID00028416	And that's it for the Crimson Caravan.
GID00028417	Well, that's settled... I suppose.
GID00028418	You find any "evidence" yet? I'm not going to wait forever.
GID00028419	Well, now that I'm free of the Outpost, was wondering if you'd mind making a detour.
GID00028420	I'd like to pay my respects to the end of Cassidy Caravans, check out the site where they died.
GID00028421	We find this "friend" of yours, looking forward to adding some red to that checkered suit of his.
GID00028422	Why the hell we wandering so much anyway? Nothing against the Mojave except the dust, heat, and scorpions, but...
GID00028423	We find this "friend" Benny of yours, looking forward to rattling his cage.
GID00028424	Never thought I'd pass the Vegas wall. Never seen so many lights in one place before.
GID00028425	Not sure who this friend of yours is, but if he's looking down on Vegas, he's either God or the moon.
GID00028426	Not one for being subtle, are you? The Tops probably never saw so much action 'til you charged in.
GID00028427	So glad you iced that little fucker. Anyone that wears a suit like that... well, they're asking for bullets.
GID00028428	So what, we chase that little cocksucker down or what? He's got to stop running sometime, and that's when we'll get him.
GID00028429	So... you talked to a big movie screen? Feeling like I'm walking down a yellow-bricked road, and there's bad news at the end.
GID00028430	What, did... did you put a plug in his cocktube to make him explode?
GID00028431	First Vegas, now NCR and Legion? You're being courted more than a Redding widow.
GID00028432	Hope you can answer them politely, or there's no safe place in the Mojave for you.
GID00028433	Still looking for a place to pitch your tent? NCR, Legion, or Vegas, seems like each of them's a beartrap, no matter where you put your foot.
GID00028434	Careful where you flash that chip of yours... not sure what kind of caps it's worth, but it's a tempting target.
GID00028435	Nothing like turning a snake's trap on itself. That Benny's a slippery fucker, but you one-upped him, all right.
GID00028436	Can't tell you how glad I am you butchered the Fiends. Caravans across the wastes are going to be buying you drinks for years.
GID00028437	Inside the Lucky 38? Not sure whether that's a blessing or a curse.
GID00028438	Sure hope you know what you're doing, Mojave's getting tense.
GID00028439	Don't get me wrong, NCR needs the help... sometimes I wish they'd step up more on their own. Not sure saving them helps them in the long run.
GID00028440	Sure hope you know what throwing in with the Legion means. Helping them running roughshod over the West is an Old World kind of cruel.
GID00028441	If someone promised me all the lights of Vegas, I'd consider it, too... but I wouldn't say yes until I saw what was behind the curtain.
GID00028442	Mojave's almost buzzing like a Cazador now... must be all the blood Legion and NCR are spilling over the Colorado.
GID00028443	Guess there's no turning back now, it's war. If Hoover Dam's where it's going to go down, better make it count.
GID00028444	Looking for trouble?
GID00028445	You come around like a bad habit. What's on your mind?
GID00028446	What's on your mind?
GID00028447	Oh, you look like you got something else to say besides ordering me around.
GID00028448	Let's hear it, you look all serious.
GID00028449	Something to say to me other than guns, distance, and stimming?
GID00028450	Whoa, why you leaning in all of a sudden?
GID00028451	Ask 'em then.
GID00028454	Fuck off.
GID00028455	Who the hell are you? I know you weren't one of the inmates.
GID00028456	What the fuck have you done? We needed that sulfur!
GID00028457	Have you wiped out those geckos yet?
GID00028458	Anything from Papa Khan?
GID00028459	Good to see you.
GID00028460	Yeah? What do you want now?
GID00028461	Somebody whacked the NCR president. Got what was coming to him.
GID00028462	Someone took out the Legion's boss. Doubt it'll stop them for long, though.
GID00028463	Lot more troops on the road these days. Wonder what's up.
GID00028464	Best to lay low. The NCR and the Legion are about to have it out.
GID00028466	Fuck you.
GID00028467	You're not one of us. What do you want?
GID00028468	I sure hope that explosion was you. Did you seal off the sulfur?
GID00028469	I guess... I guess that means we can turn ourselves in now.
GID00028470	You're back. What's the word from Papa Khan?
GID00028471	You're back.
GID00028472	Yeah, what do you want?
GID00028473	Somebody whacked the NCR president. Got what was coming to him.
GID00028474	Someone took out the Legion's boss. Doubt it'll stop them for long, though.
GID00028475	Lot more troops on the road these days. Wonder what's up.
GID00028476	Best to lay low. The NCR and the Legion are about to have it out.
GID00028478	You need water? I got water, clean and fresh, straight from Lake Mead.
GID00028479	If you're low on caps, I've also got slightly irradiated wasteland water. A little fallout never killed anybody.
GID00028480	Welcome back! Are you thirsty for some fresh, clean water?
GID00028481	Welcome to the Grub n' Gulp!
GID00028482	Welcome back to the Grub n' Gulp!
GID00028483	That business at the Tops could never happen here. We don't admit that sort of riff-raff.
GID00028484	I know Benny was murdered, but if you ask me, the real crime was that checkered jacket.
GID00028485	A little bird told me Benny might be gone for good. He must've been in some delightful scandal to have run off so suddenly.
GID00028486	Those Omertas. Always plotting, never relevant. Bravo for putting them in their place like that.
GID00028487	Word has it you were spotted entering the Lucky 38. How ever did you get on that guest list?
GID00028488	Is it me or do the Securitrons seem... sassier?
GID00028489	Such a shame about Mr. House. He used to send a Securitron to our dinner parties sometimes, like an uninvited but harmless uncle.
GID00028490	There's a rumor going around that you killed Caesar! I'm dying to know... is it true? That he used a hairpiece, I mean?
GID00028491	Caesar may be dead, but I think the toga is here to stay. You simply can't buy better thigh accentuation.
GID00028492	The Kings will be missed. Not by me, of course. But who will buy the food at the Tops now that no one needs it to grease their hair?
GID00028493	It sounds like the Kings made nice with the NCR in Freeside. Seems there was room for two flies on the same bit of dung after all.
GID00028494	Trying to elevate your status by being seen with me? It won't work.
GID00028495	You look like you'd be more at home at one of the other hotels.
GID00028496	I'm sorry, I prefer to converse with interesting people.
GID00028497	I hear you've been clawing your way up the social ladder. What's your secret?
GID00028498	People are talking about you.
GID00028499	I like the cut of your jib.
GID00028500	Well, if it isn't the toast of New Vegas.
GID00028501	Welcome to the pinnacle of society.
GID00028502	Would you mind staying here a moment? I want people to see that I know you.
GID00028503	You're an odd duck.
GID00028504	You've been acting awfully strange towards us.
GID00028505	What are you playing at? I'm really starting to wonder about you.
GID00028506	I'm having a little get-together later, but you are not invited until you learn to behave.
GID00028507	How can you be such a dear and such a bother at the same time?
GID00028508	You'll never be at the top until you learn some manners and common decency.
GID00028509	What's that smell? Oh, it's you.
GID00028510	Please, you're lowering my status.
GID00028511	Shouldn't you be in Freeside with the other thugs?
GID00028512	You vile cad. I've half a mind to give you a solid thrashing with my cane.
GID00028513	Remove yourself from my sight at once.
GID00028514	Loathsome wretch.
GID00028515	Life at the top is immensely satisfying.
GID00028516	It must be horrible to live in places without luxury.
GID00028517	Being an honorary member isn't the same as being a real member, but it still makes you better than everyone else.
GID00028518	So you've joined the Society. It feels different, doesn't it? Like you're entitled to the best things life has to offer.
GID00028519	You mustn't ask why we wear our masks. We are forbidden to speak of it.
GID00028520	The Lucky 38's perpetual glow these days... it's rather gauche, don't you think?
GID00028521	If Mr. House is going to lower his standards, we'll just have to raise ours!
GID00028522	Hello? Can you help me?
GID00028523	Have you decided to help me?
GID00028524	Please hurry! She's on the ridge, past the broken radio tower.
GID00028525	Sorry I tricked you, but thanks for clearing out the Geckos. Now I can get to that stash up there... after I deal with you.
GID00028526	What can I do for you?
GID00028527	May I help you?
GID00028528	What do you want?
GID00028529	How can I help you?
GID00028530	You shouldn't have crossed the Powder Gangers! Now you're going to pay!
GID00028531	I have a present for you from the Powder Gangers... I hope you like dynamite!
GID00028532	You'll pay for what you did to the Powder Gangers!
GID00028533	Nobody screws with the Powder Gangers and lives!
GID00028534	Here he is, boys! Let's show him what happens when you cross the Powder Gangers!
GID00028535	You want to buy Wind-Brahmin?
GID00028536	Careful, sometimes they escape and I have to round them up again.
GID00028537	Why do you scare my cattle?
GID00028538	Don't scare the herd.
GID00028539	Leave doggies alone.
GID00028540	If you're planning on staying awhile, the Dino Dee-lite's got plenty of room.
GID00028541	Don't listen to a word No-bark says. He spouts nothing but nonsense.
GID00028542	Been to the top of the dino yet?
GID00028543	Good thing none of those rockets crashed into Novac.
GID00028544	If it weren't for the water caravans, Novac would've turned to dust a long time ago.
GID00028545	Can't believe Boone shot Manny.
GID00028546	Boone must've had a hell of a grudge against Jeannie-May.
GID00028547	What did Boone have against Alice?
GID00028548	Boone thought Dusty sold Carla into slavery?
GID00028549	No-bark was harmless. There's no way he had something to do with Boone's wife.
GID00028550	Hell of thing for Boone to kill Ranger Andy like that.
GID00028551	Looks like the McBrides weren't telling tall tales after all.
GID00028552	The McBrides think some mysterious creature is shooting up their Brahmin. Gotta be somebody in town doing it.
GID00028553	All the noise at REPCONN scared the hell out of me.
GID00028554	Knew those ghouls were up to no good. Look where it got us.
GID00028555	Thanks for all your help.
GID00028556	You been real kind to us.
GID00028557	Just showed up out of nowhere and lended a hand. We appreciate it.
GID00028558	Without you we'd be in a lot worse shape.
GID00028559	I hope good things come your way.
GID00028560	We must've done something right for you to come along like you did.
GID00028561	Stay away, you hear?
GID00028562	You monster!
GID00028563	You're sick, you know that?
GID00028564	I don't much like you.
GID00028565	Maybe you should just move on.
GID00028566	You mind your business, we'll mind ours.
GID00028567	You're confusing to us. Why are you here?
GID00028568	You're kind of odd, aren't you?
GID00028569	How about you just do nice things for us. We liked those.
GID00028570	Your victory is the Legion's victory. True to Caesar.
GID00028571	You are to be commended on your martial skill.
GID00028572	Forlorn Hope has fallen, another victory for Caesar.
GID00028573	I have heard how you cleansed Forlorn Hope of the Profligates.
GID00028574	Nelson, Forlorn Hope... soon Caesar's banners shall rise on Hoover Dam.
GID00028575	Our march to the Dam is assured.
GID00028576	With Forlorn Hope's fall, our blades are at the NCR's throat.
GID00028577	Our machetes ran thick with blood here.
GID00028578	I hope to Caesar that the Profligates will send more victims to us.
GID00028579	The Profligates here were weak, no fight in them.
GID00028580	This is only the first settlement to fall.
GID00028581	The bodies of beggars and cowards fill Nelson's streets now.
GID00028582	Dead Sea has erected a tribute to Caesar - made of Profligate corpses.
GID00028583	When we're fortified here and reinforced, Forlorn Hope will be next.
GID00028584	We kill only those who resist the will of Caesar. The rest are kept as tribute.
GID00028585	Some of Nelson lives on... as slaves. They are being kept nearby.
GID00028586	If the rest of the Profligate settlements are as weak as this, Caesar's victory is assured.
GID00028587	This is only part of our detachment. We have others stationed nearby.
GID00028588	Speak to our Decanus, Dead Sea.
GID00028589	We do not move unless Dead Sea commands it.
GID00028590	We can see the Profligate cowards stationed on the hill, afraid of us.
GID00028591	You may walk here - but do not head west along the road.
GID00028592	That we hold Neslon, that is Caesar's will.
GID00028593	The "great" republic couldn't find enough soliders to liberate this camp, so they sent you? Pathetic.
GID00028594	Ave. Why have you come to Nelson?
GID00028595	What is it this time?
GID00028596	Yes?
GID00028597	Ave. You have done a great service to Caesar. Do so again, but elsewhere.
GID00028598	You hear about that band of crazy old ladies running around? I hear they're real vicious when they mug folks.
GID00028599	If the Lucky 38 coulda been giving us power all along, why all the fuss with Hoover Dam?
GID00028600	Try sleeping with that Lucky 38 all lit up above you. Just try.
GID00028601	I hear that woman can kill with her eyes! Stay away from me!
GID00028602	Your lady friend needs to lighten up.
GID00028603	Better watch out, I hear Rex likes to eat his owners. Why do you think the King was so eager to give him away?
GID00028604	Good to see Rex still around and kicking.
GID00028605	That's one ragged Ghoul you've got with you. Seems like a good guy, though.
GID00028606	That ghoul with you looks like he's older than the war! My the things he must have seen.
GID00028607	Oh no, I hear those things eat people! Stay back, freak!
GID00028608	Odd company you keep. I thought all Super mutants were crazed cannibals.
GID00028609	Weird robot. I don't think I've ever seen one of those before.
GID00028610	That looks like one of those spybots I hear House has been secretly releasing at night.
GID00028611	Business and luck don't often go hand-in-hand in the Mojave. Watch your back.
GID00028612	Check out the Wrangler if she needs booze.
GID00028613	Keep your guns to yourself and there won't be any trouble.
GID00028614	You're not doing yourself a favor by having him tag along. NCR aren't welcome here.
GID00028615	I hear that guy has hundreds of kills, not all of them deserving of death.
GID00028616	I always thought there was more to Arcade than met the eye. I bet he'll do great things without the Followers holding him back.
GID00028617	I'm surprised to see Arcade venturing out of the Old Mormon Fort. I thought science types preferred to stay indoors.
GID00028618	Howdy.
GID00028619	Hey.
GID00028620	One of these days you'll get what's coming to you.
GID00028621	Eat shit and die. That clear enough for you?
GID00028622	We don't take kindly to your type around these parts.
GID00028623	Witch! Witch! You should be burned for all the people you've turned into newts!
GID00028624	Baby-killer! Don't deny it! They told me you mowed down an entire orphanage on a dare!
GID00028625	Necrophiliac! I heard about those corpses you dug up! Stay away from my grandparents, dammit!
GID00028626	People say you practice witchcraft and dance naked in the moonlight. What the hell is wrong with you?
GID00028627	So I hear you like picking on little kids, huh? What kind of person beats up children for their lunch money?
GID00028628	People say you wear the skin of your enemies under your clothing. Is that true?
GID00028629	Leave me alone, scumbag.
GID00028630	You're a real piece of work.
GID00028631	Great. You again?
GID00028632	You're one crazy bastard, you know that?
GID00028633	I can't decide if I should shake your hand or make a run for it.
GID00028634	Good? Bad? You're the one with the weapons, eh?
GID00028635	Rumor has it you're really a posessed golem being controlled by the casinos. If this is true, where is your control crystal?
GID00028636	Planning to kill a puppy or save some goons today?
GID00028637	I have no idea what to believe when it comes to rumors about you. You must be insane or something.
GID00028638	People around here think you're a bit of an enigma.
GID00028639	Some say you like to trip old ladies crossing the street. Others say you regularly string up thugs.
GID00028640	People just don't know what to think of you.
GID00028641	Decisions are hard, aren't they?
GID00028642	We're all hoping you'll eventually figure out which side you're on.
GID00028643	Good? Bad? You're the one with the weapon.
GID00028644	Thanks for everything you've done. It really means a lot.
GID00028645	I hope some of the thugs around here follow your shining example.
GID00028646	You've been a godsend to Freeside.
GID00028647	I hear you even help the local rats cross the street.
GID00028648	People are saying you must have super powers to have pulled off all you've done in Freeside.
GID00028649	My friends have nothing but good things to say when your name is mentioned. It's great to see you.
GID00028650	Word of your work around here is spreading like wildfire. Keep it up.
GID00028651	Hey, you're the one people say has been helping out around here. Good on you.
GID00028652	I tell my friends you're a shining example of what's good around here, but they're not so optimistic.
GID00028653	Thanks for helping out around here.
GID00028654	Good to see you're still around.
GID00028655	Hey, good to see you.
GID00028656	Hmm?
GID00028657	Yeah?
GID00028658	What's up?
GID00028659	I wish I were there to see you take Benny down.
GID00028660	They say you single-handedly assaulted the dam and massacred everyone! That must have been quite a sight!
GID00028661	Well, it looks like we won't have to worry about NCR or the Legion messing with us now. I just hope the Securitrons can keep the peace.
GID00028662	They say you swarmed the dam with a whole army of Securitrons! That must have been quite a sight!
GID00028663	Can't say I like all the tin cans shuffling around, but this new Securitron Army shouldn't have much trouble keeping things safer around here.
GID00028664	Why not just put the slave collars on us yourself, you bastard. With the Legion at the dam, it won't be long before they enslave us all.
GID00028665	I heard the Legion is bringing in giant mutant dogs to assault the dam. I hope the NCR death squads packed steaks to distract them.
GID00028666	Don't be fooled. As soon as the Legion and NCR start fighting, the robots will invade and kill us all!
GID00028667	I hope the Legion gets destroyed. If they take the dam, we'll all be slaves.
GID00028668	People say the NCR are bringing in super trooper death squads to defend the dam against the Legion! This battle is going to be crazy!
GID00028669	Normally, I'd say screw the NCR, but if the Legion takes the dam, I think we're all screwed.
GID00028670	Some of my friends think the Legion is throwing a huge barbeque cookout across the river. With that much smoke rising, I believe it!
GID00028671	It looks like the Legion might be preparing for another run at the dam. This can't be good.
GID00028672	Well, aren't you just special? Everybody likes the new guy, but me? I'm chopped liver.
GID00028673	I hear you're building quite the reputation on The Strip. Don't forget about the little guys when you make it big.
GID00028674	You meet any of those Rangers dressed up in black yet? My friends say they're mutant cyborgs and they're going to kill us all!
GID00028675	That new Ranger armor is downright impressive. I'd hate to be on the business end of one of their revolvers.
GID00028676	We've already got people disappearing at night. I hear the NCR have veterans from out west coming to push us out of Freeside.
GID00028677	I've been hearing rumors of the Rangers getting some heavy reinforcements soon. Hope they don't try to start anything around here.
GID00028678	The NCR must have paid off the Kings big to get them to sign up. Maybe there was an NCR mole who tricked them into it!
GID00028679	Good news for Freeside. The Kings have decided to work with NCR for a change.
GID00028680	I hear the Kings were wiped out by some kind of Super mutant ninja assassin paid by the NCR! Who else could have taken them down?!
GID00028681	I don't get why the Kings are dead. They weren't a bad bunch of guys.
GID00028682	Some people are saying the Great Khans got drugged up out of their minds and attacked the dam.
GID00028683	I heard the Khans went wild at Hoover Dam. I suppose they were looking for one last blaze of glory.
GID00028684	I hear the Great Khans staged their own deaths to trick the NCR.
GID00028685	People say the Khans got wiped out at Red Rock. That's one less bunch of crazies to worry about.
GID00028686	The Great Khans aren't gone. They're just hiding, biding their time...
GID00028687	The Great Khans moved out? One less mob of degenerates to worry about, if you ask me.
GID00028688	The Khans signed a treaty with NCR? I've heard some crazy rumors before, but that one's rich!
GID00028689	So, the Great Khans signed up with NCR. Who would have thought those two would settle their differences?
GID00028690	Those sick Legion bastards had the brass balls to attack Bitter Springs? I bet that was one messy fight.
GID00028691	Maybe it'll be a little safer to travel, now that the Fiends' bosses are dead. We owe their killer a debt of gratitude.
GID00028692	I heard Motor Runner got taken down. Maybe the Fiends will finally destroy themselves now that he's gone.
GID00028693	I hear Hanlon was abducted by aliens and that's why he was acting so strangely. Better check yourself for strange scars.
GID00028694	Hanlon was apparently sabotaging NCR's efforts in the area. Now, I kind of wish he hadn't died.
GID00028695	I hear Hanlon was working for the aliens and NCR found out.
GID00028696	Chief Hanlon is dead? I hear that guy couldn't order himself out of a cardboard box, let alone command troops
GID00028697	My friends say Kimball's assassination was all an Illuminati plot to reclaim power. I say they're crazy. How do you kill someone with a flashlight?
GID00028698	Kimball getting killed is going to make a mess of things around here. The troopers coming through here are mean enough already.
GID00028699	My friends say you're working for the Illuminati, and that's why you killed Kimball. Watch your back. They have listening devices everywhere!
GID00028700	Killing Kimball is going to make a mess of things around here. The troopers coming through here are mean enough already.
GID00028701	Thanks for not killing Kimball. I hear he's been working against the secret alien invasion forces above the planet. They want to eat our brains!
GID00028702	So, I hear that assassination attempt on Kimball didn't quite turn out the way you planned. Now, the NCR are going to be even pissier than usual.
GID00028703	Good job saving Kimball's life. I hear he's been working against the secret alien invasion forces above the planet. They want to eat our brains!
GID00028704	I suppose you did the right thing saving Kimball, even though it means we're still screwed here in Freeside.
GID00028705	You freed that Silus guy from McCarran? Guess you've got your reasons for helping the Legion.
GID00028706	I hear the monorail bombing was an alien plot. Just a few more gates to destroy and we're all trapped in here.
GID00028707	I guess the monorail getting bombed wasn't all bad. Freeside is getting a lot more business now.
GID00028708	With the monorail down, we're going to have a lot more NCR goons wandering through here. Yay...
GID00028709	Rumor has it Mr. House joined the NCR on account of some secret love child he never even knew he had.
GID00028710	Never thought I'd see House settle for being an NCR lapdog. What the hell happened?
GID00028711	I think Caesar was killed by alien clone agents! The Legion are just a bunch of alien slaves doing their bidding!
GID00028712	I hear Caesar had an alien brain chip in his head, but he died on the operating table when they tried to remove it.
GID00028713	People say Caesar is dead. I hope someone worse doesn't replace him.
GID00028714	You killed Caesar? Rumor around here has it he was struck down by a bad case of explosive diarrhea.
GID00028715	All hail the slayer of Caesar! It's about time that slavemaster got his!
GID00028716	I don't need to read no obituary to know House was an asshole.
GID00028717	With no House to boss Vegas around, the NCR's gonna want that job.
GID00028718	According to the rumor mill, House is faking his death to catch the NCR off-guard.
GID00028719	House dead? Good riddance.
GID00028720	Better give the Securitrons a wide berth if you know what's good for you. Those new upgrades look nasty.
GID00028721	House must have special plans for you to get into the Lucky 38 and come out alive.
GID00028722	I hear you made a real mess of the Omerta's plans. Hopefully, the new management does a better job running Gomorrah.
GID00028723	Impressive work fighting off Benny's thugs! I know I wouldn't have survived that.
GID00028724	I heard you made a run on The Tops. You've got guts, kid.
GID00028725	Figures that Benny would run. Sorry coward's nobody without his thugs to back him.
GID00028726	Get rough with the escorts, and you'll be seeing the business end of my barrel.
GID00028727	With the Kings gone, who is going to keep Freeside safe?
GID00028728	If the King is working with the NCR, he must have a damn good reason. I just hope it doesn't come back to bite us.
GID00028729	Do I know you?
GID00028730	And you are?
GID00028731	Need something?
GID00028732	I'm hearing good things about you, friend. Good things.
GID00028733	Good to see someone helping out for a change.
GID00028734	People say you've been helping out around town. Much appreciated, friend.
GID00028735	You've done good, kid. Happy to have you around.
GID00028736	I'm amazed by how much you've accomplished here in Freeside.
GID00028737	We've been really fortunate to have you helping Freeside.
GID00028738	Helping on a consistent basis wouldn't hurt you, would it?
GID00028739	You've done a strange mix of things since coming to Freeside.
GID00028740	Does it get painful sitting on the fence like you do?
GID00028741	It seems you've decided to be indecisive when it comes to helping Freesiders.
GID00028742	Throwing caution to the wind yet again, huh?
GID00028743	I guess no one is ever going to change a crazy freak like you.
GID00028744	What did we ever do to you? Can't we all just get along?
GID00028745	Why the hate for Freeside? We're not all bad.
GID00028746	What the hell do you want?
GID00028747	Go to hell you two-faced bastard.
GID00028748	Go away, you rotten bastard.
GID00028749	Way to stab us in the back, asshole.
GID00028750	Howdy, doc. Strange to see you wandering around.
GID00028751	I admire a woman who can hold her liquor. Cute to boot.
GID00028752	She looks like she knows how to handle herself in a fight.
GID00028753	I hope you programmed that thing to be friendly to Freesiders.
GID00028754	Super mutant? You don't look so super to me.
GID00028755	How's it hangin', old man? Oh, sorry.
GID00028756	Hey, Rex. I see your new master is keeping you polished up. Good for you.
GID00028757	Cheer up, lady. You've still got your youth.
GID00028758	This job's boring enough without talking to you. Go see Alexander.
GID00028759	Alexander doesn't pay me to talk.
GID00028760	We're just muscle. Alexander's the man to talk to.
GID00028761	Hi, mister. I hope you're doing fine today.
GID00028762	Hello, ma'am. I hope you're doing fine today.
GID00028763	I thought I'd be seeing you again.
GID00028764	You a merc? 'Cause you don't look like a prospector...
GID00028765	I've still got guns and ammo, if you need them.
GID00028766	I lost everything I had at The Tops, but if you gave me 500 caps, I'd head straight back. Sick, huh?
GID00028767	I came east to strike it rich, and now I'm broker than ever. What do I tell my family back home?
GID00028768	On the Strip, everyone's nice to you when you got the caps. The moment you don't? They throw your ass out.
GID00028769	I won big my first night on the Strip. I kept chasing that feeling. Right into the gutter.
GID00028770	I sat down at a roulette table with my life savings. An hour later, it was gone.
GID00028771	Can you spare some caps, mister?
GID00028772	Can you spare some caps, 'mam?
GID00028773	Go East! they say. Scrap lying in the sun for you to grab. Yeah, right.
GID00028774	The Strip ain't nothing but a monster. Chews folks up, sucks out their caps, and spits 'em back out.
GID00028775	The Strip's got more gorgeous women than I ever seen in one place, and most of them's affordable.
GID00028776	You hear the losers around here complaining how they lost their shirts on the Strip? It's pathetic.
GID00028777	After I win big, I'm going to buy my friends dinner at that fancy Gor-mant restaurant. I saw ads for it back home.
GID00028778	I walked all the way from Hub! Thought I'd rest my feet here a day or two, then I head onto the Strip fresh.
GID00028779	I'll get in, win big, get out. Take those winnings back home where they'll do some good!
GID00028780	You know it's illegal for us to gamble back home? The government wants to keep us poor.
GID00028781	I'm sick of the sob stories you hear around here. If you don't know when to stop gambling, that's no one's fault but your own.
GID00028782	I can't wait to see the Strip. I hear it's so beautiful!
GID00028783	I only work for caravans, all right? Try someone else.
GID00028784	Sitting around here makes me miss my raider days. I don't know why I figured it was time to get respectable.
GID00028785	Whatever you're selling, I ain't buying.
GID00028786	A friend of mine at the Dam says President Kimball might visit the troops out there. Imagine shaking the president's hand!
GID00028787	Do you believe there are folks who'd pay 500 caps for a steak dinner? Over at the Ultra-Luxe! Honest!
GID00028788	If you want to get fucked up, Gomorrah's the place to go. Wish I was there now.
GID00028789	You gotta piss someone off to pull guard duty out here.
GID00028790	Camp McCarran is paradise compared to this place. A two-minute monorail and you're on the Strip!
GID00028791	You been to the Strip? Last time I had R&R, I left with 300 caps more than I went in. Who says the House always wins?
GID00028792	I thought the dam was boring. Then they stuck us out here to watch over this scrap heap.
GID00028793	Watch yourself if you're heading further south. There's been trouble down by Nelson and Searchlight.
GID00028794	Try not to make any trouble. We like it quiet around here.
GID00028795	If I hear one more loser moan about losing everything they own on the Strip, I may shoot him in the head.
GID00028796	It's quiet out here. We like to keep it that way.
GID00028797	Don't make any trouble for us, we won't make any trouble for you.
GID00028798	Welcome to the 188 Slop & Shop. Like our slogan says, "It's better than nothing."
GID00028799	Feeling thirsty?
GID00028800	Welcome to the 188 Slop & Shop. How can I help you?
GID00028801	Back for more?
GID00028802	Is there some reason I should be talking to you?
GID00028803	Still making a nuisance of yourself?
GID00028804	I don't work for freelancers. So move along.
GID00028805	Stay out of my way and I'll stay out of yours, got it?
GID00028806	Watch out for Fiends.
GID00028807	We don't need the NCR.
GID00028808	I kinda like being a farmer.
GID00028809	I'm glad Mean Sonofabitch is on our side.
GID00028810	Crops aren't getting as much water lately.
GID00028811	We're better off with those slaver bastards Saint James and Dermot.
GID00028812	That Sweetie sure is something.
GID00028813	I'm gonna miss having Anderson around.
GID00028814	Anything new happening?
GID00028815	I'm heading to Gomorrah next time I get some time off.
GID00028816	I sure hope I get to meet President Kimball.
GID00028817	I wonder if the President will come this way again, he had kind of a close call I hear.
GID00028818	The Legion would have to be insane to attack this place.
GID00028819	The sound of the generators is really quite calming.
GID00028820	Private Watson sure seemed excited about meeting Kimball.
GID00028821	I actually got to see the President.
GID00028822	I hear President Kimball had a pretty close call with some assassins.
GID00028823	The death of the President is going to be a permanent blight on this place.
GID00028824	If the President of our republic isn't safe here, how can we be?
GID00028825	Kimball died, security seemed so tight, how could such a thing happen?
GID00028826	President Kimball is going to arrive pretty soon to give his speech and meet that wounded soldier.
GID00028827	How do we know if Mr. House is really gone? No one's ever seen him in the first place!
GID00028828	Colonel Moore survived four tours against the Brotherhood back west. If anyone can help take on the Legion, it's her.
GID00028829	You hear that rumor that Colonel Moore was kicked out of Gomorrah a while back? I heard she's had it in for the Omertas ever since.
GID00028830	I'm really surprised Colonel Moore accepted the Brotherhood's help. I heard she lost a lot of men in war with them back west.
GID00028831	Is it true? Was there really a Brotherhood base nearby that blew sky high?
GID00028832	I heard a rumor that Moore hired some mercs to wipe out the Khans. Is that such a good idea, with Bitter Springs still on peoples' minds back home?
GID00028833	Man, I'm exhausted. Moore's got us running drills non-stop.
GID00028834	Just between us, Colonel Moore scares me sometimes.
GID00028835	Our victory was never in question.
GID00028836	How did the Legion make it into the power plant?
GID00028837	Let's get going!
GID00028838	Let's get to fighting! Now is not the time to talk!
GID00028839	I'm not sure I'll ever learn everything there is to know about this place.
GID00028840	How do they keep the floor in here so clean?
GID00028841	They should have used Paladins to help protect the President.
GID00028842	If the NCR wasn't too proud to accept our assistance their president would still be alive.
GID00028843	The NCR is lucky we've chosen to side with them or we'd take the death of their President as a moment of weakness.
GID00028844	We are here to help protect the dam, word is Oliver is on his way and the battle will start soon.
GID00028845	We're ready to deploy whenever the NCR says the word.
GID00028846	The Brotherhood hasn't seen a real battle in so long, I have no doubt we'll handle this no problem.
GID00028847	The NCR is going to be grateful to have us around when the shooting starts.
GID00028848	The Elder sent us to help protect the dam and await further orders.
GID00028849	Mike Lawson sure knows his way around the dam.
GID00028850	I'm honored to work with Lawson, he knows more about the dam than anyone.
GID00028851	Fantastic grabbed my ass. That guy is vile.
GID00028852	I'm pretty sick of Fantastic, can't that guy keep his hands to himself?
GID00028853	Everyone is abuzz about Oliver arriving soon. That must mean the battle is close.
GID00028854	Hanlon is pretty legendary, people talk about what he did at the first battle of hoover dam with awe and respect.
GID00028855	I miss California.
GID00028856	By Mars these weaklings die easily.
GID00028857	Don't get in my way!
GID00028858	Try to keep up, if you can.
GID00028859	Now is the time for killing, not words!
GID00028860	This was all too easy.
GID00028861	I long to join my brethren in the power plant below. The fighting's probably fiercer there.
GID00028862	Our orders are to take and hold this section of the dam.
GID00028863	These men fight hard, and die well.
GID00028864	Ha ha, isn't it glorious?
GID00028865	These dogs are putting up a fight, I'll give them that.
GID00028866	The exterior is ours. The interior will fall soon.
GID00028867	There's talk of much land and slaves going to the one who kills Oliver. If only I wasn't assigned here!
GID00028868	With the outside secured, the poor fools inside have nowhere to run.
GID00028869	Oliver's head is as good as mine!
GID00028870	Is it true the fighting outside has stopped already?
GID00028871	Upstairs, or down? If I were a coward, where would I hide?
GID00028872	Make good use of cover. The time to strike is when they reload.
GID00028873	Their guns aren't quite as effective in these close quarters.
GID00028874	Soon this place will belong to the Legion.
GID00028875	I've added eight notches to my belt already. How many for you?
GID00028876	You must get to the control room and install the override chip.
GID00028877	I will protect you.
GID00028878	I hope the Legion doesn't get in here.
GID00028879	Sorry, but I'm busy with patients right now.
GID00028880	Julie Farkas wasn't kidding when she said we would be needed here.
GID00028881	All this bloodshed. Such a waste of human life.
GID00028882	Please don't hurt me!
GID00028883	I'm just a medic! Please don't hurt me!
GID00028884	Mormon caravan from New Canaan came through the other day.
GID00028885	The Crimson Caravan's the biggest merchant outfit in the wasteland.
GID00028886	Damn Brahmin crap everywhere.
GID00028887	I'm glad Ringo's back. Got a good story to tell, too.
GID00028888	Fucking expensive to get into the Strip these days.
GID00028889	Keep an eye out for wildlife.
GID00028890	When pay day hits, I'm off to the Strip. Can't wait.
GID00028891	McLafferty's been riding asses again. Better lay low.
GID00028892	McLafferty's a hard boss, but she knows what she's doing, that's for sure.
GID00028893	Guess Jamison won't be showing his face around here again. It's about time.
GID00028894	Tough luck for Janet, huh? I know I'd hate to lose all that pay.
GID00028895	I've never heard of anyone breaking their contract and still getting their pay. Janet is damn lucky.
GID00028896	I hope they don't close the quarry. I need the money.
GID00028897	With Chomps in jail, who's going to run things at the quarry? He was our most experienced guy!
GID00028898	Maybe I was just seeing things, but I could've sworn I saw some people up on the ridge by the quarry.
GID00028899	I can't believe Chomps got arrested! They said he was involving in smuggling, if you can believe it.
GID00028900	The Deathclaws have been keeping their distance. For now.
GID00028901	When do you think the NCR will send their troops to help us?
GID00028902	Jas screwed up the coffee again. Wouldn't drink it if I were you.
GID00028903	It's too damn hot.
GID00028904	Sure is nice to have the lights on again.
GID00028905	With the Deathclaw pack leaders dead, I hope we can get back to work soon.
GID00028906	Snuffles' leg seems to have gotten better.
GID00028907	Man, I wish I'd stayed back in California some days.
GID00028908	Generator's still not working. Big surprise.
GID00028909	Poor Snuffles. Wish somebody could do something about his leg.
GID00028910	If I don't get more water soon, I won't make my quota this season.
GID00028911	Don't know about you, but this beats herding Brahmin back in California.
GID00028912	The maize is doing well in this soil.
GID00028913	I'm glad the troopers are smart enough not to trample everything.
GID00028914	Something - or someone - has been chewing on the coyote tobacco again.
GID00028915	We're finally getting all the water we're supposed to. It's about time.
GID00028916	Word is they're sending some of us home since we're not making the quota.
GID00028917	Can't grow crops if they don't give us the water.
GID00028918	Only thing you're good for is target practice.
GID00028919	Bet you'd blow up real good.
GID00028920	Watch your step, Outsider.
GID00028921	I got a shell with your name on it.
GID00028922	I can spot a Brotherhood spy from a thousand yards. Even the cute ones.
GID00028923	I've never seen a ghoul up close. Not sure I wanted to.
GID00028924	That thing is housebroken, right?
GID00028925	I like you big mutants. You're easy to sight.
GID00028926	Did you know you have a robot following you?
GID00028927	Whatever you're selling, we have plenty.
GID00028928	Keep your distance, soldier.
GID00028929	A doctor? Who's your supplier?
GID00028930	Idle thumbs tend to get blown off around here. Get moving.
GID00028931	Sorry, I've got work to take care of.
GID00028932	I'd keep moving if I was you.
GID00028933	Go back to the Strip where you belong.
GID00028934	You're nothing like us, Outsider.
GID00028935	We should have never let you in.
GID00028936	You're no different than a common Fiend.
GID00028937	What are you looking at?
GID00028938	Keep your distance.
GID00028939	I'm not sure what to make of you, Outsider.
GID00028940	What do you know about our problems?
GID00028941	Welcome back.
GID00028942	Hey there. Kill any Outsiders lately?
GID00028943	You can shoot with me anytime, friend.
GID00028944	Always nice to see you.
GID00028945	Hope the trip into camp wasn't too eventful!
GID00028946	Keep your head down, Outsider.
GID00028947	I've got my sights on you, Outsider.
GID00028948	Stand back where I can see you.
GID00028949	Saw you coming a mile away.
GID00028950	I actually got to fly Pearl for a little bit during that boming run. Hot damn, what an honor.
GID00028951	All those hours training? Glad they finally paid off.
GID00028952	Did you see it? I hear the suckers burned right through their armor.
GID00028953	It was wonderful seeing Pearl fly and serve the purpose she was built for.
GID00028954	It's getting nasty out here. S'times like these I thank god for artillery.
GID00028955	War's brewing on the horizon, plain as day.
GID00028956	We've survived out here pretty well so far without any help from the outside.
GID00028957	You should get out of my face before you get yourself hurt.
GID00028958	I don't have anything to say to you, outsider.
GID00028959	I don't know how you survived the bombardment. That's incredible.
GID00028960	I don't think you should be here.
GID00028961	I'm happy you came along. You are the answer to our dreams.
GID00028962	You've earned our trust, now let's see if you can earn our gratitude.
GID00028963	I can't believe we may see the superfortress built in my lifetime.
GID00028964	Really? So we may see our dream of flight soon?
GID00028965	I hear you're going to help us, I hope you're up for the task.
GID00028966	I'm happy that we managed to raise the bomber in my lifetime.
GID00028967	Thank you so much for your help.
GID00028968	I didn't think the day would ever come, but thanks to you our dreams have come true!
GID00028969	I'm amazed that an outsider has proven so helpful.
GID00028970	You've given us the ability to touch the sky! Thank you.
GID00028971	You've done us a great service. Thank you.
GID00028972	You've done us a great service. Thank you for your help.
GID00028973	I'm not going to take anything from you. Leave me alone!
GID00028974	Hey! You tried to get me sick!
GID00028975	You should learn to give kids nice things... Like toys!
GID00028976	You're the one that tried to give me that yucky stuff.
GID00028977	I don't think I should talk to you. You aren't very nice.
GID00028978	You need to leave me alone. I don't like you anymore.
GID00028979	You're lots of fun. We should play sometime.
GID00028980	I'm going to be a hero and travel the wasteland like you when I grow up.
GID00028981	I'm going to tell Mama Pearl how cool you are.
GID00028982	I bet you have all kinds of fun stories.
GID00028983	I like you, we should play sometime!
GID00028984	Thanks for the toy! It was great!
GID00028985	I'm going to play raise the B-29!
GID00028986	I can't believe Pearl let you stay with us.
GID00028987	I sure hope Pearl knows what she's doing.
GID00028988	Sorry, no time to talk, Outsider.
GID00028989	I bet you'd make an awesome Boomer.
GID00028990	Yay! I love my new toy!

GID00029055	I hate it here, fucking sulfur stinks.
GID00029056	This vault gives me the creeps.
GID00029057	Have you read the logs on the computers? Fucked up shit.
GID00029058	Fucking geckos.
GID00029059	No way I'm going back to prison.
GID00029060	So much for Lem, you should have seen it, guts flying everywhere.
GID00029061	Lem was going to turn us all in to the NCR, I'm glad he's dead.
GID00029062	We can finally relax with Cooke gone.
GID00029063	Cooke left the vault, good thing too he was going to get us all killed.
GID00029064	Cooke is going to get us all killed.
GID00029065	Lem wants to run back to the NCR and turn himself in, spineless bastard.
GID00029066	I hear the Great Khans are pretty tough, I hope we can join them.
GID00029067	Join the Great Khans, what the hell is Cooke thinking?
GID00029068	I don't know about this whole Great Khan thing...
GID00029069	Did you hear? We're going to join the Great Khans.
GID00029070	I don't want to join the Great Khans, but I guess it's better than going back to prison.
GID00029071	Hmm, join the Great Khans or die in the wasteland? Good fucking plan Cooke.
GID00029072	I don't want to join the Great Khans.
GID00029073	Don't look at me!
GID00029074	Someone's watching me, I can feel it.
GID00029075	So many staring eyes...
GID00029076	The voices in my head are getting louder...
GID00029077	The pain won't go away.
GID00029078	The cure is finally coming to make the voices stop.
GID00029079	We were promised a cure long before this, and now we must wait some more?
GID00029080	Why should we stay if Keene is dead?
GID00029081	Perhaps the rest of us should follow Keene into the wasteland.
GID00029082	There's too much light. Why is there always too much light?
GID00029083	Damn muties. Wasteland is better off without 'em.
GID00029084	Can't wait to get the rest of our pay for this job.
GID00029085	Wish the muties would make a move. Getting sick of waiting.
GID00029086	It's much cooler up here. I love it.
GID00029087	Muties aren't so tough if you've got the firepower.
GID00029088	Job's done here. Time to pay a visit to Freeside.
GID00029089	Probably should check my gear again, just to be safe.
GID00029090	If you need a place to stay, check out Vault 21.
GID00029091	I've heard about you.
GID00029092	It's good to see you around the Strip.
GID00029093	You turned around?
GID00029094	When I get back home, I'll tell everyone I met you.
GID00029095	Step up to the tables, let's see what you got.
GID00029096	Almost outta caps...
GID00029097	I can't believe you've got the gall to stroll down the Strip after what you've done.
GID00029098	Maybe someone else in the Strip can help you?
GID00029099	If you don't mind, I rather we don't talk right now.
GID00029100	How the hell did the monorail blow up? Someone's bringing back luck into the Strip, I tell you.
GID00029101	Kimball's dead, I wonder how long until the Legion's at our walls.
GID00029102	Vegas at night is like nothing else.
GID00029103	The robots here look different than others I've seen.
GID00029104	Shame about the fighting at the Tops; it's got the best patrons around here, hands down!
GID00029105	Us NCR folk got to stick together, even if the Strip is the safest place in New Vegas.
GID00029106	Beats being on patrol.
GID00029107	Just lost a month's caps...
GID00029108	You're the one who busted those assholes at Gomorrah, huh? Good work!
GID00029109	Fucking Crocker couldn't find his ass if it wasn't on his backside...
GID00029110	Don't be carrying any guns into the casino.
GID00029111	You look like you just crawled out of the desert.
GID00029112	Love how this place comes alive at night.
GID00029113	You should see this place at night.
GID00029114	Looking to lose a few caps, huh? Just the place.
GID00029115	I never trusted those Omerta punks, even if I like their girls.
GID00029116	I don't trust those creeps at the Ultra-Luxe.
GID00029117	We need more people like you in the NCR.
GID00029118	We should straighten those thugs at Gomorrah.
GID00029119	We've heard about you from the officers at our embassy.
GID00029120	You're wasting no time in making a name for yourself around here, huh?
GID00029121	The bots have enough firepower to arm a full platoon.
GID00029122	A Ranger, here in the Strip? Fine company, sir!
GID00029123	I won't be missing Mr. House, that's a given. The Strip's better off without him.
GID00029124	It was a matter of time before someone got to Mr. House.
GID00029125	Mr. House won't trouble our plans for the Strip any longer, huh!?
GID00029126	NCR should take this chance, now that Mr. House's out of the way.
GID00029127	Good riddance, Caesar! We can finally enjoy some R&R without worrying about a Legion attack at McCarran.
GID00029128	Fuck that Caesar dog! I'm going to drink in your name, all night!
GID00029129	I tell you, something stinks about this Monorail attack!
GID00029130	My buddies at McCarran will find the asshole that destroyed our Monorail.
GID00029131	So, our President's savior is enjoying a well deserved R&R? Fine piece of work you are!
GID00029132	Once I'm done here, I hope they assign me to find the son of a bitch that took down our President.
GID00029133	It's good to have the Khans on our side, but I hope they keep them out of the Strip. Those savages smell like Bighorner's ass.
GID00029134	I heard it got nasty at the Tops; wish I could've seen the shooting.
GID00029135	My buddies at Camp McCarran are breathing easy now that the Fiends' leader is dead.
GID00029136	Without leadership, the Fiends are as good as dead!
GID00029137	What's a mutant doing in the Strip?
GID00029138	They let Ghouls into the Strip, now?
GID00029139	Hold up, you look new to Vegas - I'll keep it short: no weapons allowed in the casinos.
GID00029140	Hand them over, you'll get them back when you leave.
GID00029141	Keep to the games, and there won't be any problems.
GID00029142	Back for your gear? Here you go.
GID00029143	Hey, there, friend, a bit of advice - you look like you could use some *protection.* Lucky for you, I got what you need.
GID00029144	My stock and trade? Alllll kinds of easy-to-hide weapons for slipping into and out of casinos, they won't give you a second glance.
GID00029145	Heard the Dam finally got what's coming to it. Strange days ahead - and that's why it's best to face the day armed.
GID00029146	Some crazy days on the Strip. Still... it's good for business.
GID00029147	Back again? Need a weapon for an emergency, Mister Holdout's your guy.
GID00029148	Traveling into the Strip just got a lot easier now that the Fiends' leaders are dead.
GID00029149	Stories of how you saved President Kimball are the talk of the Strip, friend!
GID00029150	If someone can blow up the Monorail, I guess we're not safe even in the Strip.
GID00029151	Lady Luck's on your side. I hope some of that rubs off on me, Caesar killer!
GID00029152	Now that you've killed that Caesar bastard, the Strip's really going to bloom!
GID00029153	Someone got Mr. House. The Strip's going to change, I'd bet on it.
GID00029154	After what happened to Mr. House, nobody knows for sure what's in play for the Strip.
GID00029155	The tables turned for Mr. House. What next, huh?
GID00029156	Looks like Mr. House run out of luck, huh?
GID00029157	Later, uh, whoever you are.
GID00029158	I don't talk to "nobodies," not when I'm having the time of my life!
GID00029159	Sorry, I'm here to have a good time, not talk to random people.
GID00029160	Howdy, come try your luck? I hope's on your side.
GID00029161	That's a true friend of this wonderful place! Lady Luck shines on you.
GID00029162	One of New Vegas' finest! You are always welcome in the Strip.
GID00029163	It's a pleasure to see you, friend! Best of luck during your stay.
GID00029164	So, what do you want with me?
GID00029165	I'm not scared of you. Give me a good reason to call the law and, I swear, you'll regret it.
GID00029166	Don't... do anything to me, okay?
GID00029167	Uh-oh, I'll call the Securitrons if you try anything crazy with me, understand?
GID00029168	What the hell do you want?
GID00029169	Beat it, or I'll call the bots on you right quick.
GID00029170	I'm not going to talk to you!
GID00029171	I swear, I could kill you right now and never look back.
GID00029172	You better scram before I sic the entire Strip after you.
GID00029173	These bots now have eyes on their backs, I swear!
GID00029174	You're the talk of the day around the casino tables.
GID00029175	I'd not touch Gomorrah's machines until the dust settles.
GID00029176	I could smell something fishy going on at Gomorrah.
GID00029177	I bet dirty business are going on at Gomorrah.
GID00029178	I bet dirty business are going on at Gomorrah.
GID00029179	Come on... time to get lucky.
GID00029180	Luck's about to change, I can feel it.
GID00029181	Damn slots are robbery.
GID00029182	Send those chips my way.
GID00029183	Come to get fleeced like a Bighorner?
GID00029184	Roulette, blackjack, slots... they have it all here.
GID00029185	Ready to try your luck?
GID00029186	Step up, let's see your game.
GID00029187	You look like you got the itch, friend.
GID00029188	You want to gamble with class? Hit the Ultra-Luxe, if you don't mind being serviced by masked creeps.
GID00029189	Watch the slots, they're robbery.
GID00029190	Wish I could've seen what's inside the 38.
GID00029191	You've been making a name for yourself around here already.
GID00029192	Did you hear? Gomorrah's under new management!
GID00029193	You look new here - be careful of Gomorrah.
GID00029194	Watch your caps - they go quick.
GID00029195	Seeing the sights?
GID00029196	The Ultra-Luxe is fancy, but I get the shivers when I see their staff wearing masks.
GID00029197	Who would have thought a place like this would exist?
GID00029198	At this rate, one Securitron is going to be enough to defend the whole Strip.
GID00029199	Good to have you around!
GID00029200	Thanks for helping us keep the Strip safe.
GID00029201	Sir.
GID00029202	Miss.
GID00029203	Ma'am.
GID00029204	Pleasure.
GID00029205	An NCR welcome to you.

GID00029220	Area is off-limits, citizen.
GID00029221	Return to the surface, citizen.
GID00029222	Disobedience will be punished.
GID00029223	Look, "friend," don't get near me - you're too well respected for my business.
GID00029224	Hey, think you can walk around here like nothing's happened?
GID00029225	See, my friends and I, we were kinda wondering if we should give you a good beating right now, or save it for when we catch you outside.
GID00029226	We don't like you Mojave scum, and we like you even less when you fuck with our Strip.
GID00029227	So, you either pay up to walk around here, or we're gonna make you pay up. That clear?
GID00029228	You back again, huh? We missed you, we've been waiting for you. Bet you've missed us too.
GID00029229	Fuck off, punk. And pray we don't hear about you doing crazy shit again.
GID00029230	Fuck this. I'm out of here - let them deal with this crazy place.
GID00029231	I can't believe I put up with this kind of crap.
GID00029232	Hey, think you can walk around here like nothing's happened?
GID00029233	See, my friends and I, we were kinda wondering if we should give you a good beating right now, or save it for when we catch you outside.
GID00029234	We don't like you Mojave scum, and we like you even less when you fuck with our Strip.
GID00029235	So, you either pay up to walk around here, or we're gonna make you pay up. That clear?
GID00029236	You back again, huh? We missed you, we've been waiting for you. Bet you've missed us too.
GID00029237	Well, hello there. What a coincidence, finding you outside the Strip.
GID00029238	You should've paid your dues, but, no, you had to play hard, huh? Now it's our turn.
GID00029239	Nobody fucks with the NCR and lives to brag about it. You're dead, punk!
GID00029240	Man, I'm sick of this place. Can't wait to get back to Red Rock.
GID00029241	The NCR sure did a number on this place.
GID00029242	Hope the NCR doesn't send reinforcements from the Dam.
GID00029243	Fuck Benny. We'll make him pay for stabbing us in the back.
GID00029244	There's more of them still out there.
GID00029245	Beats going up against the Legion.
GID00029246	Never gone up against Great Khans before.
GID00029247	Man, this place is a mess.
GID00029248	This rubble is slippery. Watch your step.
GID00029249	We didn't get all of them. Talk later!
GID00029250	It's about time they called us back.
GID00029251	Work's slow right now, but at least it's something.
GID00029252	Train's not working yet.
GID00029253	I'm happy the Big Horn is still around.
GID00029254	Some of the machinery's frozen up. Need someone to talk a look at it.
GID00029255	Run! Beasts got free!
GID00029256	Deathclaws are loose! Get out of here!
GID00029257	It can't be! How the hell...
GID00029258	Holy shit! Run for your lives!
GID00029259	What a fight!
GID00029260	Go Red!
GID00029261	Blood! We want more blood!
GID00029262	Kiiiiiiill, kill now!
GID00029263	I'm betting for Blue!
GID00029264	Did you see that?
GID00029265	Until next time.
GID00029266	Great fighting today.
GID00029267	There's always more next day.
GID00029268	That was a good day for The Thorn.
GID00029269	The beasts don't look so tough behind bars, huh?
GID00029270	I can't imagine this place will ever disappear.
GID00029271	There's nothing else like The Thorn!
GID00029272	One day I'll get to see Deathclaws tear through Fiends!
GID00029273	I hope Red Lucy gives us the *big* monsters, next.
GID00029274	More fights, we want more.
GID00029275	I can't wait to see what fights next.
GID00029276	What the hell?Is that a half-robot dog?
GID00029277	You better control thatthing. Bots can't be trusted.
GID00029278	A Follower is always welcome among our people.
GID00029279	Keep the Ranger on a leash around here.
GID00029280	Another Supermutant roaming outer New Vegas, huh?
GID00029281	All humans are welcome here, even Ghouls.
GID00029282	That Fiend leader got what he fucking deserved.
GID00029283	Fuck that Fiend bastard. Wish I would've seen him die.
GID00029284	Can't help thinking that we've not seen the last of the Fiends yet.
GID00029285	I hope the Fiends have learned their lesson.
GID00029286	Won't have to worry about those Fiend assholes for some time now, huh?
GID00029287	I heard Mr. House's done for. I hope the Sewers don't turn for the worse.
GID00029288	We should reclaim the rest of city, if the rumors about House are true.
GID00029289	You saved the NCR's head honcho, sure you can save a bunch of low-life scum like us.
GID00029290	Got time to save us too, or are you running errands for your NCR masters?
GID00029291	Even Presidents die, huh? Good.
GID00029292	Caesar's death don't change shit down here.
GID00029293	That Legion boss would've never taken the city, but I'm glad he's a goner.
GID00029294	Wonder if we can move into the Sewers under the Strip now that Mr. House is outta business.
GID00029295	If there's war in the end, it won't affect our city.
GID00029296	Rumors of imminent war have made it all the way down here.
GID00029297	Going to stay down here until all the trouble outside blows over.
GID00029298	Looks like the entire region's going straight where we are - knee-deep in shit.
GID00029299	Only one bad thing about the Thorn, it brings all the idiots, assholes and topsiders down here.
GID00029300	I can't wait to hit The Thorn. I wouldn't mind hitting on Red Lucy either, but she's outta my league.
GID00029301	Going to place me a good bet at The Thorn.
GID00029302	Want to see the best of New Vegas? Our sewers got it - The Thorn!
GID00029303	Saw a monster rip a man in half at The Thorn.
GID00029304	Hey, you're the one that's been hunting the most dangerous beasts for The Thorn!
GID00029305	Hey, It's great what you're doing for The Thorn, way to go!
GID00029306	Wish I could've seen you capture those beasts for our Thorn!
GID00029307	I've heard of your fights at The Thorn. People down here don't stop talking about you.
GID00029308	Taking down a Giant Radscorpion, by yourself, has made you popular down here.
GID00029309	Killing Fire Geckos at The Thorn is no joke, you're quite the fighter!
GID00029310	You've beat Night Stalkers, right? We don't see that often down here.
GID00029311	You've taken down Cazadores! Didn't think I'd ever see that.
GID00029312	I heard you've killed Deathclaws at The Thorn. I couldn't believe it!
GID00029313	One of these days, Red Lucy's going to show off her Deathclaws.
GID00029314	All hell broke loose when the creatures escaped from The Thorn!
GID00029315	One of those beasts cut my friend in half! How the hell did they escape from Red Lucy?
GID00029316	Can't believe that The Thorn's no more.
GID00029317	Can't believe that The Thorn's no more.
GID00029318	Red Lucy was a fine warrior, and a beautiful woman.
GID00029319	We'll miss Red Lucy down here.
GID00029320	Fiends don't come here no more, they say.
GID00029321	I bet NCR troops can't wait to clean the sewers.
GID00029322	New Vegas, paradise, my ass.
GID00029323	NCR should head back to their lands, I'm sure *their* people miss them.
GID00029324	NCR came all the way to save us, huh? Guess they missed the shit-holes.
GID00029325	Stay underground at night.
GID00029326	Watch out where you exit. Sewers can lead you to Fiend territory.
GID00029327	Keep an eye on your stuff - damn thieves.
GID00029328	Don't go too far, it's all shadows and dangers in the lower levels.
GID00029329	Careful with those Fiends in the western sewers.
GID00029330	I need my fix.
GID00029331	I hurt all over.
GID00029332	Going to eat the next fucking rat I see.
GID00029333	Just got to find me some sweet Jet.
GID00029334	Won't ever make enough to live outside.
GID00029335	Can't go anywhere else.
GID00029336	Don't think I'll make it topside any time soon.
GID00029337	Smells like shit all the time, but at least we're safer than in the Wastes.
GID00029338	Good to see you respect the Followers.
GID00029339	Make sure the NCR dog behaves, you're in the Mojave now.
GID00029340	Your merchant friend is always welcome among us.
GID00029341	That bot of yours don't look like anything I've seen in the Mojave.
GID00029342	Your friend's not from the desert, is she?
GID00029343	We tolerate Wasteland savages, as long as they respect our rule around here.
GID00029344	The owner of the Vault was murdered. I thought we were safe inside the Strip.
GID00029345	I like the place, but I wouldn't want to live underground all my life.
GID00029346	Can you imagine how much electricity it takes to keep this Vault running?
GID00029347	People lived in here for hundreds of years, can you imagine?
GID00029348	I wish the rest of the Vault were accessible.
GID00029349	They have a fantastic menu at the diner.
GID00029350	Haven't found any Radroaches, so far.
GID00029351	This place's got a weird gloom after Miss Weintraub died.
GID00029352	Did you get a tour? The owner has done a great job with this place.
GID00029353	I've never seen so many pretty lights in my life.
GID00029354	{Self Justification)It's cramped in here, sure, but who really needs a fancy room, anyway?
GID00029355	Ya got any change, man? I've got five kids to feed.
GID00029356	You're a crazy son of a bitch, you hear me! The Tops!? Ha! Crazy.
GID00029357	Ya got any change, man? I've got five kids to feed.
GID00029358	Yeah I saw Benny running through here! He had the fear of the devil in him!
GID00029359	You killed ol' cheeser!? They said he was a God! Ha, who ever heard of a God of cheese?
GID00029360	Cheeser's dead!? They said he was a God! Ha, who ever heard of a God of cheese?
GID00029361	There are many good things in life, but peeing is definitely the best.
GID00029362	Hey! Don't poke me!
GID00029363	Ow! Why are you poking me!
GID00029364	You've got to keep your bitches in line!
GID00029365	You've got to keep your bitches in line!
GID00029366	Go bother someone else.
GID00029367	A man is never drunk if he can lie on the floor without holding on.
GID00029368	Woooooo!
GID00029369	Where'd The Kings go?
GID00029370	Hey doc! You got any Fixer?! I've got a bender planned that would make a hobo cry.
GID00029371	I think your friend wants to eat me! Please don't let him!
GID00029372	Is there anything more beautiful than a beautiful busty brahmin riding a caravaneer off into the sunset... Wait I don't think that came out right.
GID00029373	I'll give you five caps for the robot!
GID00029374	Your ghoul friend looks shifty. Watch your pockets, buddy!
GID00029375	What happened to your buddy's face?
GID00029376	I am not an alcoholic, sir. I'm a drunk! There's a difference!
GID00029377	I am not an alcoholic, ma'am. I'm a drunk! There's a difference!
GID00029378	The problem with some people is when they're not drunk, they're sober.
GID00029379	People ask me how much it takes me to get drunk. I don't know. I usually can't remember numbers, let alone where I am the next morning.
GID00029380	Hey! Watch your back! There be a pack of ol' ladies runnin' round here somewhere! Don't let them catch you unawares!
GID00029381	Got some fresh grub coming in from Goodsprings.
GID00029382	Joe Cobb's crew got themselves killed over in Goodsprings.
GID00029383	Who's going to take charge with Eddie out of the picture?
GID00029384	Haven't seen a decent caravan come up the road in days.
GID00029385	Think that rollercoaster in Primm is still working?
GID00029386	If it weren't for Cooke, we'd still be slaving away for the NCR.
GID00029387	Gotta wonder why the NCR hasn't come for us.
GID00029388	We sure showed those bastards in the NCR.
GID00029389	Haven't seen Meyers around. Did he run off or something?
GID00029390	Scrambler's crazier than usual. Watch yourself.
GID00029391	You hear about the Deathclaws north of here?
GID00029392	Could've sworn I saw some Great Khans the other day.
GID00029393	Steer clear of the Mojave Post. NCR troopers all over the place down there.
GID00029394	Man, I'm glad Scrambler's gone.
GID00029395	I'm looking forward to getting sent across the river.
GID00029396	That prisoner, Benny, managed to slip away somehow.
GID00029397	The new slave girls are quite beautiful.
GID00029398	The camps are getting crowded.
GID00029399	Slaves aren't much of a challenge in the arena.
GID00029400	I didn't think anyone could kill an NCR Ranger in single combat.
GID00029401	Caesar lives!
GID00029402	I'll mourn Caesar - he was a great man.
GID00029403	Lupa met an honorable death in the arena.
GID00029404	Some of the slaves have been spreading stories about the Burned Man again.
GID00029405	Mess with any of the equipment here and I'll mount your head on a stick.
GID00029406	Stay out of the control room and enclosure or there's gonna be trouble, got it?
GID00029407	Look all you want, just don't mess with any of the equipment. The control room's off-limits, and so is the enclosure.
GID00029408	Mess with any of the equipment here and I'll mount your head on a stick.
GID00029409	Stay out of the control room and enclosure or there's gonna be trouble, got it?
GID00029410	Look all you want, just don't mess with any of the equipment. The control room's off-limits, and so is the enclosure.
GID00029411	Just give us an excuse. Been too long since I fired my weapon.
GID00029412	Don't go fucking about, asshole.
GID00029413	Mess with any of the equipment here and I'll mount your head on a stick.
GID00029414	Just try pulling some of your Brahmin shit here at the Dorado and see what happens.
GID00029415	Not much happens here at the Dorado, and that's how we like it.
GID00029416	Only combat I seen lately was shooting some Geckos.
GID00029417	All the juice from Hoover flows right through the Dorado, and we send it west to keep the home lights burning.
GID00029418	My folks back home got lights at night thanks to what we're doing here.
GID00029419	We keep an eye out for Legion raiding parties. They'd love to shut down the Dorado.
GID00029420	Stay out of the control room and enclosure or there's gonna be trouble, got it?
GID00029421	The power transmission cables are all underground. Good thing, or the old war might've knocked them down.
GID00029422	You visiting every NCR post just to see the sights? This here's the Dorado - it's where we send power back home.
GID00029423	Look all you want, just don't mess with any of the equipment. The control room's off-limits, and so is the enclosure.
GID00029424	Get away! I'm not part of your fight!
GID00029425	Get away from me! I don't want to get shot!
GID00029426	Careful! There's still more of them.
GID00029427	Don't think this is over yet.
GID00029428	Way too many strangers coming into town these days. No offense.
GID00029429	If you're looking for supplies, Chet over at the general store can help you out.
GID00029430	Why don't you just move on to another town?
GID00029431	Just leave us alone.
GID00029432	We need more people like you around.
GID00029433	Bit of a troublemaker, aren't you?
GID00029434	Don't really care much for the unpredictable types. Just saying.
GID00029435	That Doc Mitchell sure knows his stuff, doesn't he?
GID00029436	At least the Powder Gangers are letting me live.
GID00029437	I'm glad I didn't try to fight the gang.
GID00029438	Hell of way to repay Doc, if you ask me.
GID00029439	So many good people are dead...
GID00029440	You come to the wrong place, traveler. Primm's dying. If you got any sense, you'll be moving on.
GID00029441	Quite a town we got here. Sheriff gets murdered, and Deputy Beagle dragged off for ransom to the Bison Steve. That should bring back the tourists.
GID00029442	Rather be left alone to my misery, if you don't mind.
GID00029443	Before the Powder Gangers came to town, Johnson Nash ran the local store and the Mojave Express station.
GID00029444	I ain't got nothing for you to eat. If you're hungry, see Ruby Nash.
GID00029445	Thanks for freeing the deputy. A bit, anyway.
GID00029446	Thanks for freeing Deputy Beagle. He's better than nothing. Maybe.
GID00029447	Now you freed Deputy Beagle, all Primm needs is a law man who can shoot a gun without wetting hisself.
GID00029448	I hear you're going to help find Primm a new sheriff. Mighty kind of you to take an interest.
GID00029449	So you're the one's going to bring the law back to Primm? I'll believe it when I see it.
GID00029450	I hear you aim to bring rule of law back to our town. God knows we need the help.
GID00029451	Thanks for bringing the NCR to town, stranger. Things're finally looking up for Primm.
GID00029452	Thanks to you I got a mess of soldiers watching every move I make, plus I got to pay taxes for the privilege!
GID00029453	Those soldiers you brought down on us is all business, stranger. Better than lawlessness, though. So you've got my thanks.
GID00029454	This new Sheriff Meyers you brought to us is a lawman through and through. Primm's looking up, stranger.
GID00029455	Thanks for convincing Meyers to come sheriff for us. First time I feel safe in a long time.
GID00029456	This Sheriff Meyers you found for us is working out. Knows his business. We owe you a debt.
GID00029457	Man, it is a real uphill fight these days. I'm not sure how we are going to handle all these convicts.
GID00029458	If you got something to say, say it to the Lieutenant.
GID00029459	Careful, things aren't as safe around here as they could be.
GID00029460	You'll probably want to talk to Hayes.
GID00029461	Keep an eye out for more of them.
GID00029462	This town don't look like much.
GID00029463	Beats being in prison.
GID00029464	I got dibs on the old doc's house.
GID00029465	Need more women around here.
GID00029466	Never liked Bighorners.
GID00029467	Those townies put up a bigger fight than I expected.
GID00029468	That was a hell of a gunfight.
GID00029469	Nothing left to do but kick back and booze it up.
GID00029470	You think any townies are hiding?
GID00029471	I knew we were going to win all along.
GID00029472	Hello and welcome to Gomorrah. How can I help you?
GID00029473	Hey there, can I get you a drink, maybe a party favor?
GID00029474	You looking for a good time?
GID00029475	What the fuck are you looking at?
GID00029476	What the fuck are you looking at?
GID00029477	If I wasn't working right now, I'd show you a real nice time.
GID00029478	Enjoying the show?
GID00029479	I wouldn't mind taking a bite of you.
GID00029480	Damn, you're looking tasty.
GID00029481	Securitrons with faces like soldiers? Is this martial law or something? What the fuck?
GID00029482	So Mr. House sells Vegas out to the NCR, eh? I always knew that freak was a rat.
GID00029483	What the fuck's up with the Lucky 38 being lit up all the time, eh?
GID00029484	Shit, I can't believe Cachino betrayed the Family.
GID00029485	I got kicked outta Ultra Luxe the other day. Man, that place gives me the fucking creeps.
GID00029486	Business is good. All the Familes got money. Of course Gomorrah is where the action is.
GID00029487	I'm glad they don't let just any motherfucker through the gate. Freeside smells like shit.
GID00029488	Fiends are bad for business. NCR should do their fucking job.
GID00029489	There's some serious shit going on between NCR and the Legion. They better not fuck with our power.
GID00029490	Fuck Not-At-Home, must be cozy up there in the Lucky 38.
GID00029491	Bosses don't like no trouble in their place.
GID00029492	Gomorrah is always open for Business.
GID00029493	Find yourself a girl or a guy. Have some fun.
GID00029494	I think there is something wrong with that dog.
GID00029495	Uh, I don't think we allow her kind in here. I'll let it go this time though.
GID00029496	What the fuck is that thing?
GID00029497	Big tough ranger better not start any trouble in here.
GID00029498	Let me know if the pretty lady with you is looking for some work.
GID00029499	That Follower fucker is going to have some trouble if he tries to liberate any of our employees.
GID00029500	Kings sold out to the NCR huh? Might be worth a sit down with them.
GID00029501	Word on the street is something big is about to go down at Hoover Dam.
GID00029502	I hear you been making some waves around here.
GID00029503	I hear the Legion is moving some new tough muscle into the area. NCR better keep their heads down.
GID00029504	Kings were small time. Not surprised they got themselves iced.
GID00029505	Those fucking Monkey Khans joined the NCR? I can't believe they finally got themselves civilized.
GID00029506	Khans finally got what they had coming. Glad we won't have to worry about them again.
GID00029507	You hear what happened over at Bitter Springs? Not too pretty.
GID00029508	Kimball managed to get himself knocked off. Serves him right.
GID00029509	I hear Kimball dodged a bullet there.
GID00029510	The NCR seems none too happy about losing their little train.
GID00029511	Glad that fucker House is gone.
GID00029512	Woah, the great Caesar is dead. The management doesn't seem too happy.
GID00029513	I hear Mr. House cashed out. Ain't much to miss.
GID00029514	Holy shit, you been in Lucky 38? You meet the big man in there?
GID00029515	Things are good since Cachino took over.
GID00029516	I hear you chased that chicken shit Benny off. Good riddance.
GID00029517	Did Benny beg before you burned his sorry ass?
GID00029518	Nice work at the Tops, buddy.
GID00029519	Welcome back to Gomorrah, find yourself a girl or a guy, and have a drink. You're family.
GID00029520	Your ghoul wants to have some fun he can, we don't discriminate.
GID00029521	I tell you, Not-At-Home is gonna have his day.
GID00029522	Hot damn do I love this place.
GID00029523	This place smells like booze and sex. That's why I always come back.
GID00029524	I hope my dad doesn't find out how much money those hookers cost me.
GID00029525	The Tops is a real snooze fest. I hope they get some new shows soon.
GID00029526	A tribe called the Great Khans has joined us. They'd better be good fighters.
GID00029527	They say a doctor killed Caesar. Why would Caesar need a doctor?
GID00029528	I can't believe Caesar is dead. What will we do now?
GID00029529	Caesar has been seen walking among the troops. A good omen.
GID00029530	One of our agents successfully assassinated the NCR president.
GID00029531	Good morning, sir.
GID00029532	What can I do for you?
GID00029533	Good morning, madame.
GID00029534	What can I do for you?
GID00029535	Good evening, sir.
GID00029536	What can I do for you?
GID00029537	Good evening, madame.
GID00029538	What can I do for you?
GID00029539	Think you can beat the house, baby?
GID00029540	Lucky 21, baby!
GID00029541	Feeling lucky? I got the best table in the joint!
GID00029542	Scram, baby, I'm on my break.
GID00029543	Can't you see I'm taking it easy here?
GID00029544	Look, I'll be back at the table soon, baby, don't fret.
GID00029545	Little birdies are chirping about the big Cheese of the Legion going deadsville real unexpected-like. Crazy old world, ain't it?
GID00029546	You hear some crumb tried to kill the president of the NCR? Gutsy, baby. Real gutsy.
GID00029547	Ain't you the cat that tried to ice the President? Gutsy, baby, showing your face in here.
GID00029548	Uh-oh, here comes trouble!
GID00029549	Ha ha, this cat's crazy!
GID00029550	Baby, you bring crazy with you!
GID00029551	Hey, play it cool, baby, we just got the place fixed up.
GID00029552	They, ah, checked your weapons at the door, right?
GID00029553	Baby, you are some kind of crazy.
GID00029554	Well, I guess your money's good here.
GID00029555	Just do what you came to do and get out.
GID00029556	We don't need your kind of trouble.
GID00029557	You got some kind of nerve strolling around in here like this.
GID00029558	Christ, who let you through security?
GID00029559	You ain't welcome here, so just take a hike.
GID00029560	This place is the bees knees!
GID00029561	I dig this crazy slang!
GID00029562	Ehh, the broads are better looking at Gomorrah.
GID00029563	Buy a gal a drink?
GID00029564	Hey, handsome.
GID00029565	Why don't you come up and see me sometime?
GID00029566	Don't get too close to Mr. Benny
GID00029567	No sudden moves around the boss, got it?
GID00029568	I got my eye on you, so no funny business.
GID00029569	Keep those hands where I can see 'em.
GID00029570	Ring-a-ding, baby.
GID00029571	How's it hangin'?
GID00029572	Heya, baby, what's the haps?
GID00029573	You dig this crazy scene or what?
GID00029574	This guy right here! This is the guy!
GID00029575	This gal right here! This is the gal!
GID00029576	Hang loose, baby.
GID00029577	Baby, good to see you!
GID00029578	Hey hey, there's my guy!
GID00029579	Hey hey, there's my gal!
GID00029580	Yeah, baby, now we can start the party!
GID00029581	Hope Swank's smarter than Benny.
GID00029582	Wonder where Benny got off to?
GID00029583	I thought Benny was a stand up guy - hard to believe he was a fink all along.
GID00029584	Hey, play it cool, baby, we just got the place fixed up.
GID00029585	Oh no, not again!
GID00029586	You're the fink that killed Benny!
GID00029587	I wonder where Benny ran off to.
GID00029588	Heh. Guess those Omerta finks got what was coming to them.
GID00029589	Who thought it was a good idea to give the robots missile launchers?
GID00029590	If Mister House ain't the top dog on the Strip, whaddya suppose that means for us?
GID00029591	Those Securitrons handing out obituaries? Creepy.
GID00029592	You're the gasser who killed Caesar, ain't ya? Ring-a-ding!
GID00029593	Ain't seen no soldier boys for a while. Guess they're all scared of coming out after that big boom.
GID00029594	Looks like the troops are back. Good thing, too, this place was deadsville without their caps.
GID00029595	Ain't you the cat that stopped Kimball getting iced? Gutsy, baby, but don't expect no free drinks for it.
GID00029596	You hear some crazy crumb killed the president of the NCR? Gutsy, baby. Real gutsy.
GID00029597	Hey, I heard about you - you're the one who saved the President! Here, this one's on me.
GID00029598	I heard the Kings over in Freeside got their asses handed to 'em. Lousy no-good bums.
GID00029599	Way I hear it, some big-leaguer NCR rangers are coming to town to dance a two-step all over Caesar's head.
GID00029600	You dig these new rangers all dressed to the nines? Baby, the new fashion is killer-robot-chic!
GID00029601	I got a pal who says the Legion's calling in their 18-karat big-leaguers. We're talking the boys from Arizona, baby.
GID00029602	Baby, you couldn't pay me enough to step off the strip these days. Legion cats are out there thick as fleas on a dog, and they ain't no bums, neither.
GID00029603	Hey, there's the high-roller!
GID00029604	Baby, it's as tense as a virgin at Gomorrah out there. Things are heating up and if they don't cool down it's straight endsville.
GID00029605	At least in the old days we could up and split when things got too heavy. Right now I miss those days.
GID00029606	Baby, it's gonna be open war out there soon. If it was up to me we'd pack our toys, put this town to our backs and say "next stop: Scramsville."
GID00029607	Why's the Lucky 38 take to shining all of a sudden? I smell a caper.
GID00029608	House selling out to the NCR? Who woulda figured him for a fink?
GID00029609	Go away, human.
GID00029610	Head voices don't *like* you, squishy man!
GID00029611	No! Head voices don't talk to you. Only to me!
GID00029612	I keep an eye out for Rangers in black armor. I haven't killed one yet.
GID00029613	Had the Legionaries at Nelson been more seasoned, we'd still hold the settlement.
GID00029614	Ave.
GID00029615	Move along.
GID00029616	Imagine, a Follower brave enough to leave Freeside.
GID00029617	The dog is part-machine... but its brain is flesh.
GID00029618	What a revolting sight. To call that a friend?
GID00029619	That machine looks like a floating eye. I don't like it.
GID00029620	How does one get that blue monster to obey?
GID00029621	All that Caesar promised has come true.
GID00029622	Ave, amicus.
GID00029623	Look to Bitter Springs to see what happens to disloyal slaves.
GID00029624	I've heard the stories of how you assassinated Kimball. It's all my Legionaries will about.
GID00029625	Kimball's assassin is always welcome here.
GID00029626	The Centurion Silus will be punished for letting himself be captured. Coward.
GID00029627	Legatus Lanius is come. The battle for the dam will soon begin!
GID00029628	Legatus Lanius will arrive soon enough - and with him comes slaughter.
GID00029629	Legatus Lanius draws near. The Profligates' days are numbered.
GID00029630	Legatus Lanius is known as the Monster of the East - a name he has earned many times over.
GID00029631	The black-armored Rangers are said to be fearsome in battle.
GID00029632	The Legionaries fret like women over rumors of Rangers in black armor.
GID00029633	There have been sightings of Rangers in black armor, the best the Profligates have to offer.
GID00029634	I wish I could hear the Profligates weeping over the explosion at McCarran!
GID00029635	The Mark of Caesar protects you.
GID00029636	The warlord House thought himself beyond Caesar's reach. And now he is dead.
GID00029637	Never once did I believe that was near death. I have friends in high places.
GID00029638	The Legion will survive Caesar's death. It must!
GID00029639	I felt the earth shake when the evil below the Fort was destroyed!
GID00029640	Soon the Legion's veterans will arrive from Arizona. Each has killed many times his number.
GID00029641	Our hounds were bred to kill. They are missed.
GID00029642	It's said that every living thing at Nelson and Forlorn Hope camp was killed.
GID00029643	I hear the Profligates at Forlorn Hope begged for their lives.
GID00029644	Had I been the commander of our forces at Nelson, the town would still be ours.
GID00029645	The Legionaries at Nelson were killed to a man. No survivors.
GID00029646	So frightened are the Profligates that they've begun signing treaties with primitive tribes!
GID00029647	Keep barking and I'll feed you to a dog.
GID00029648	Watch yourself, Profligate.
GID00029649	Hold your tongue, wastrel.
GID00029650	Degenerates like you belong on a cross.
GID00029651	Wretched Profligate. Try making some trouble.
GID00029652	You belong on a cross, degenerate.
GID00029653	I'd rather kill you than talk to you.
GID00029654	When the time comes, I'll be the one to kill you.
GID00029655	Give me cause, Profligate.
GID00029656	Attack me. Give me license to kill you.
GID00029657	You aren't trusted here, Profligate.
GID00029658	You serve yourself, not the Legion.
GID00029659	Why is your degneracy tolerated?
GID00029660	You can't be trusted... but you're useful.
GID00029661	How are we to trust one such as you?
GID00029662	Who knows what you'll do next?
GID00029663	You're a crazed one. I'll not talk to you.
GID00029664	You do well to serve the Legion.
GID00029665	You're wise to serve the Legion by choice.
GID00029666	You've proved yourself useful, at least.
GID00029667	You serve the Legion well, amicus.
GID00029668	We each serve the Legion, in our way.
GID00029669	Good to see you, amicus.
GID00029670	Ave, amicus.
GID00029671	I know your kind. You die easily enough.
GID00029672	Have you seen the Legion's veterans, arrived from Arizona? They are fearless!
GID00029673	It's said the Legion's veterans will arrive from Arizona soon. They are a sight to behold.
GID00029674	Legatus Lanius is on the march. When he arrives, the real slaughter will begin.
GID00029675	I have fought beneath Legatus Lanius many times. He cannot be defeated.
GID00029676	Finally, the dam will be assaulted. Legatus Lanius is come.
GID00029677	Kimball's assassin. Nicely done.
GID00029678	True to Caesar.
GID00029679	House signing up with the NCR, you hear? Fucking sell-out.
GID00029680	If House is dead, how'd the lights get turned on in his place, huh?
GID00029681	House is dead, wonder if Motor-Runner will let us hit the strip now.
GID00029682	Why's that tower on the Strip all fucking lit up now, huh? I don't like it.
GID00029683	Your pet ghoul smells like ass.
GID00029684	Is that Mean Sonofabitch? They all look the same to me.
GID00029685	A flying robot? Man, I must be fucked up.
GID00029686	You hear about this courier doing shit around the Strip? Like what, delivering mail?
GID00029687	I wouldn't mind hitting that. She put out?
GID00029688	You see a Ranger in black, run the other way. Take you out from a quarter mile off.
GID00029689	Primm is going to be much tougher to push around with that new sheriff down there.
GID00029690	Someone is targeting us, I'm gonna kill that fucker when I find out who did it.
GID00029691	The Khans are all gone, wonder if they left behind their shit for making our goods.
GID00029692	House unplugged like a light. Wonder if he twitched before he bit it.
GID00029693	Fuck, where are we gonna get our shit from now that the Khans are all buddy buddy with the NCR.
GID00029694	So long as the Khans keep making it, I keep getting high.
GID00029695	Someone is targeting us, I'm gonna kill that fucker if we find out who did it.
GID00029696	Motor Runner dead? Who the fuck gonna run the show now?
GID00029697	Kimball dead, maybe the NCR will learn to stay the fuck out of other people's business.
GID00029698	That NCR prez survived a Legion hit? Wouldn'ta guessed.
GID00029699	NCR is going to be rip shit about losing their little train.
GID00029700	House all dead, we should hit the Strip. Rip shit up.
GID00029701	House dead, Strip can belong to anyone who wants it. Fiends to rule.
GID00029702	People all scared of those robots on the Strip since they changed. Like who needs the Strip anyway?
GID00029703	We can't sit idly while the Legion prepares their own elite forces.
GID00029704	The time to assert our rule over the territories has come.
GID00029705	I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
GID00029706	Those Legion beasts needed to be put down, like the vermin they are!
GID00029707	Did you hear about the Legion Defeat at Nelson? We're winning back our territories.
GID00029708	As long as the Khans leave our lands alone, I don't care what happens.
GID00029709	I always knew House would give in! Sixth state of the union, here we come!
GID00029710	I'd wager that the army's sending elite units our way, right as we speak.
GID00029711	Bitter Springs... a name like that could've only brought bad luck.
GID00029712	I'll believe that the Fiends are gone when they stop their raiding and pillaging.
GID00029713	Should've bet we'd kill the Fiend's leader.
GID00029714	Everywhere I go, people are talking about our President's assassination.
GID00029715	With House out of the way, I hope someone opens the Lucky 38.
GID00029716	I see you prefer the company of anarchic cultists to civilized peoples.
GID00029717	What makes you think I give a damn about you?
GID00029718	Just, don't do anything crazy.
GID00029719	I hope you're doing well, friend!
GID00029720	Don't bother me, please.
GID00029721	This is it. War's almost upon us.
GID00029722	Word is you're getting popular in The Strip.
GID00029723	I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
GID00029724	War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
GID00029725	Those Freeside thugs aren't worth our time anymore.
GID00029726	Khans are history, it serves them right!
GID00029727	Did you hear about Hanlon? What a blow!
GID00029728	You killed him! What have we done to you?
GID00029729	I hear some asshole freed our enemy from McCarran.
GID00029730	Someone blew up the Monorail, right by our troops!
GID00029731	With Mr. House dead and gone, Vegas can finally join the NCR!
GID00029732	Your robot looks worth quite a few caps.
GID00029733	If the Legion can equip their men so well, maybe they can take care of me too.
GID00029734	I hope the Fiends stop their raids now that their boss is gone
GID00029735	Bad weather ahead, I tell you. The death of our President's just the start.
GID00029736	Don't care about Kimball, until he starts to care about us.
GID00029737	Don't dump your Ghoul here, we've already got enough shit around us.
GID00029738	People of my trade respect the merchants of these territories.
GID00029739	I hear the Khans won't trouble us anymore.
GID00029740	I hear the Securitrons are tougher since their faces changed.
GID00029741	House was the only thing keeping Vegas from joining the NCR!
GID00029742	You're the one that killed Caesar, right?
GID00029743	After all, Caesar died like the old man he was.
GID00029744	That Caesar bastard had it coming.
GID00029745	I'm glad those damn bots are gone for good.
GID00029746	Our guys put the Monorail back to work!
GID00029747	We owe you so much for saving our President.
GID00029748	Can you believe they tried killing our President? Don't they know who they are dealing with?
GID00029749	Our own President, murdered! Things aren't looking good.
GID00029750	Hanlon was a brave soldier, what could've driven him to despair?
GID00029751	That Fiend leader shouldn't have messed with our great army.
GID00029752	The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
GID00029753	If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
GID00029754	Those Khans are savages, but we can use them to our advantage.
GID00029755	Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
GID00029756	I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
GID00029757	I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
GID00029758	I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
GID00029759	Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
GID00029760	Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
GID00029761	Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
GID00029762	Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
GID00029763	I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
GID00029764	Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
GID00029765	Things are getting stranger every day.
GID00029766	It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
GID00029767	Back home we don't waste time talking to strangers, either.
GID00029768	I really have more important things to do, sorry.
GID00029769	Good to see a friend of our government.
GID00029770	The NCR appreciates good citizens like you.
GID00029771	I'm glad to see you.
GID00029772	The NCR's fortunate to have your support.
GID00029773	You're a model citizen, thank you.
GID00029774	What do you want with me?
GID00029775	You're not going to cause any problems, right?
GID00029776	Uh-oh, back off and leave me alone.
GID00029777	I don't want any trouble, okay?
GID00029778	What the hell's going on in your crazy head?
GID00029779	Don't talk to me!
GID00029780	I don't waste my time with troublemakers.
GID00029781	We should have you tried, and then killed on the spot!
GID00029782	I'm too civilized, otherwise I'd stone you to death.
GID00029783	I should make you pay for your crimes!
GID00029784	I've seen Followers of the Apocalypse in my travels before.
GID00029785	NCR Rangers deserve all my praise.
GID00029786	Is your friend one of those elite troops we've been hearing about?
GID00029787	Your merchant friend would make a fine NCR woman.
GID00029788	I've never seen a robot like that before.
GID00029789	The Supermutant's under control, I hope.
GID00029790	I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
GID00029791	I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
GID00029792	I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
GID00029793	I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
GID00029794	Your Ghoul friend better not be radioactive.
GID00029795	What on earth is *that* creature?
GID00029796	Your lady friend seems out of place here.
GID00029797	Your friend seems too civilized for a place like this.
GID00029798	Caesar's fate was sealed from the start.
GID00029799	Wish I could've seen that Legion dog suffer.
GID00029800	My lucky day, running into our President's savior!
GID00029801	I'm glad the President is still here to help us settle in these new territories.
GID00029802	I'm not surprised Kimball survived. We NCR people are made of hard stuff.
GID00029803	I should kill you myself for what you did to Kimball, and fuck the law!
GID00029804	Even without our President, we won't leave the new territories!
GID00029805	I bet I'd get a reward for bringing your head to the authorities, assassin!
GID00029806	Kimball's luck ran out.
GID00029807	I should've taken the Fiend's head for myself.
GID00029808	They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
GID00029809	They say it's safer to travel now that Fiends are retreating, but I'd still look out for trouble.
GID00029810	As we've done with the Fiends, we'll kill anyone who resists our fight for peace.
GID00029811	Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
GID00029812	We're just pushing our luck by signing a treaty with those savage Khans.
GID00029813	The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
GID00029814	I told everyone we shouldn't have bet for the Khans.
GID00029815	It's clear that savages, like the Khans, can't be trusted to civilize.
GID00029816	I'll tell everyone back home about how the NCR deals with wild thugs, like the Kings.
GID00029817	The Kings were pushing it too far, and they got what was coming to them.
GID00029818	I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
GID00029819	Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
GID00029820	Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
GID00029821	Nelson will serve as example. We'll bleed the ground red with anyone who opposes our peace-efforts.
GID00029822	You'll pay for what you did to our soldiers at Forlorn Hope, murderer!
GID00029823	It's good to hear that Primm has accepted our law.
GID00029824	A reliable source told me we're getting the best NCR soldiers to help us against the Legion.
GID00029825	Have you seen them? Our Rangers are the finest men alive!
GID00029826	People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
GID00029827	Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
GID00029828	You'd be crazy to put your money on either side of the coming battle.
GID00029829	Why the hell is the Lucky 38 all lit up these days? I don't like it.
GID00029830	We'll make this land peaceful, after we kill everybody who opposes us.
GID00029831	It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
GID00029832	It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
GID00029833	What's up.
GID00029834	Uh huh.
GID00029835	Hey.
GID00029836	Never seen a guardian dog like that before.
GID00029837	With Caesar out of the way, we'll assert our rule over the territories.
GID00029838	I knew that the Khans were animals. We should kill them like vermin.
GID00029839	What on earth could push you to destroy Forlorn Hope?
GID00029840	You're not going to raze us to the ground, like you did to Forlorn Hope, right?
GID00029841	NCR will civilize all this Wasteland, Primm is only the beginning.
GID00029842	I've heard that we're getting strong reinforcements to help us civilize the territories.
GID00029843	Instead of spending a fortune in this war, the NCR should be paying us to survive!
GID00029844	I could buy back my *life* with the money it must cost to make one of those Ranger elite armors!
GID00029845	The Legion better watch out now, our Rangers are going to turn the tables around!
GID00029846	Despite our strength, the Legion army looks fierce enough to make me waiver.
GID00029847	Maybe when this is all over, they'll find time to look after us.
GID00029848	It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
GID00029849	Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
GID00029850	The great tower of the enemy city blazes with light. What does it mean?
GID00029851	Sometimes friend, sometimes foe. No one knows what to make of you.
GID00029852	I've heard stories about you. No one knows what you'll do next.
GID00029853	I'm not looking for trouble. You can ignore me.
GID00029854	Excuse me.
GID00029855	My feet are killing me.
GID00029856	It's said that you were responsible for Caesar's death.
GID00029857	The Legionaries are pleased - an enemy called the Brotherhood of Steel is dead.
GID00029858	The Great Khans tribe went mad. During the battle at the Dam, they attacked both the Legion and the NCR.
GID00029859	The Legion has won a great victory over the NCR at a place called Forlorn Hope.
GID00029860	I've heard that a great enemy of the Legion was assassinated in New Vegas.
GID00029861	Caesar was ill, but now he lives.
GID00029862	How disgusting. You can see that strange mechanical mongrel's brain.
GID00029863	Ugh. One of the burned people walks in our camp.
GID00029864	What a strange floating robot. Is it useful for anything?
GID00029865	What is that thing? I've never seen a blue mutant.
GID00029866	I overheard some of the Legionaries say that more veterans from the eastern campaigns will be summoned to the Fort.
GID00029867	The leader of New Vegas and his army of robots has defeated both the NCR and the Legion. What will happen now?
GID00029868	There's talk that many of the ranking Legionaries will be beheaded for allowing the NCR to defeat the Legion yet again.
GID00029869	A great battle is coming. Many veterans of the Legion have begun arriving from the east.
GID00029870	There are many rumors about who'll lead the Legion now that Caesar is dead.
GID00029871	That was quite an explosion a while ago. We felt the ground shake!
GID00029872	I've heard rumors that one of the tribes west of the river may join the Legion.
GID00029873	The work never ends...
GID00029874	So many tasks to attend to...
GID00029875	I need to rest.
GID00029876	It's best if I'm not seen talking to you.
GID00029877	Be careful, or you'll end up being crucified.
GID00029878	The Legionaries grumble about you. Be careful.
GID00029879	The Legionaries want to kill you. Please don't get me involved.
GID00029880	The Legion hates you. Why do you come here?
GID00029881	Please - I'll be in trouble if the Legionaries see you speaking to me.
GID00029882	You're trouble, I can tell.
GID00029883	Be careful - the Legionaries aren't sure they can trust you.
GID00029884	You're not quite an enemy, nor are you a friend.
GID00029885	Your favor with the Legion grows, I've heard.
GID00029886	Some of the Legionaries talk about you with growing respect.
GID00029887	I'm honored to serve.
GID00029888	Someone as important as you noticing me? I'm flattered.
GID00029889	The Legionaries speak highly of you. I'm not worthy of your attention.
GID00029890	It's an honor to be noticed by one so favored by the Legion.
GID00029891	You're a woman, and yet you wander free?
GID00029892	It turns out the Lucky 38 had its own reactor all along. Now that it's operational, the city doesn't need power from the dam.
GID00029893	You're just as bad as the NCR or the Legion. What did the Followers ever do to you?
GID00029894	People like you are the reason the Followers haven't brought civilization back to the wasteland yet.
GID00029895	I don't know what you have against the Followers, but I don't want any trouble.
GID00029896	You're always welcome among the Followers, friend.
GID00029897	The Followers are lucky to have a friend like you.
GID00029898	If you ever need the assistance of the Followers, just ask.
GID00029899	You're making it hard to trust you, you know.
GID00029900	At least you've making up for some of the trouble you've caused.
GID00029901	They said you're friendly enough, but that we ought to keep an eye on you.
GID00029902	I hear you've done some good things for the Followers.
GID00029903	The Followers are always on the look on for new friends like yourself.
GID00029904	I appreciate how you've been helping us so far.
GID00029905	I really don't have anything you'd want.
GID00029906	Look, I've got people to care for. I'm not looking for trouble.
GID00029907	I don't get you. Sometimes you help the Followers, and other times you work against us.
GID00029908	You're an enemy of the Followers, as far as I'm concerned. I don't care how you've helped us.
GID00029909	The Followers can't trust you, you've proven that.
GID00029910	I never imagined Mr. House would concede to the NCR. I wonder what convinced him...
GID00029911	When people have got nothing left, they can always turn to the Followers.
GID00029912	The Gun Runners ought to help the Followers by donating some of that firepower they've got.
GID00029913	Wish the Followers would get me some better armor.
GID00029914	Stay alert.
GID00029915	Keep an eye out for trouble.
GID00029916	There are so many refugees to care for.
GID00029917	Medicine's running low again.
GID00029918	All that wealth is wasted on the Strip. There are people in Freeside who need food and medicine.
GID00029919	I have no idea how most of these people would survive without us.
GID00029920	I didn't know the Brotherhood had any people out here.
GID00029921	Look at that - a cyber-dog. There can't be many of those left.
GID00029922	Look at that - a friendly Nightkin. What's it doing here?
GID00029923	That is one battered Eyebot. It's a miracle it's still functioning.
GID00029924	Isn't that Cass? I heard she'd gotten out of the caravan business.
GID00029925	That's a First Recon beret. They're the best marksmen in the NCR military.
GID00029926	I'll never get used to the sight of ghouls.
GID00029927	The Brotherhood had a bunker in Hidden Valley, but it was destroyed somehow.
GID00029928	I never thought I'd see the day when the NCR and the Kings started getting along.
GID00029929	The Kings got hit hard. I don't know how many of them are still alive, if any.
GID00029930	President Kimball was careless and overconfident, and it got him killed.
GID00029931	Who would have thought someone would try to assassinate President Kimball with all those troops around?
GID00029932	Did you see the monorail explode? The destruction was absolute.
GID00029933	Caesar's death is good news for the NCR. For everyone, most likely.
GID00029934	No one knows how Mr. House died. His obituary didn't say anything useful.
GID00029935	The Securitrons in and around the Strip have been upgraded. It's almost like Vegas has an army now.
GID00029936	Someone entered the Lucky 38. That's never happened before.
GID00029937	Big shakeup in the management at Gomorrah. I wonder what that's about?
GID00029938	Someone killed Benny, the Chairmen's bigshot, in his own casino. Violence begets violence...
GID00029939	Did you hear about the shootout at The Tops?
GID00029940	We're only trying to help people, and you're not making it easy on us.
GID00029941	Don't let anything happen to Arcade, all right?
GID00029942	See Julie Farkas if you need anything.
GID00029943	Move along, buddy. I have work to do.
GID00029944	Heard there was a firefight in one of the big casinos. Maybe they'll need to buy more ammo now.
GID00029945	Careless of the NCR to let their monorail get blown up. Don't they have sentries standing watch?
GID00029946	The Legion isn't going to go away just because Caesar is dead, if the rumor is even true.
GID00029947	Kimball's bodyguards are probably pretty thankful they had Gun Runner weapons backing them up.
GID00029948	Kimball's bodyguards should've been more heavily armed if they wanted to keep him alive.
GID00029949	It's always good for business when the NCR scores a victory like the one at Nelson.
GID00029950	Damn shame about Camp Forlorn Hope.
GID00029951	Business has been brisk. Something big's coming, I can feel it.
GID00029952	The orders for service rifles and ammunition have been pouring in from McCarran so fast we can't keep up. Hell of a fight is coming.
GID00029953	First Recon is a top-notch unit. They're always buying sniper rifles from us.
GID00029954	That Eyebot looks like it's gone through hell.
GID00029955	I had no idea there was such a thing as a friendly Nightkin. Look at that thing.
GID00029956	I've never a dog like that. Who thinks up these things?
GID00029957	Man, I love my guns.
GID00029958	People usually aren't stupid enough to steal from the Gun Runners. Usually.
GID00029959	It's amazing what passes for a firearm around here. You'd be better off throwing rocks.
GID00029960	The Lucky 38, all lit up in the distance? It's an inviting target.
GID00029961	Mr. House finally wised up and said he'd join the NCR in a year or something like that. Good news all around.
GID00029962	Have you seen what one of those anti-materiel rifles can do to a Deathclaw?
GID00029963	Demand for Gun Runner weapons is high, so don't expect them to stay in stock for very long.
GID00029964	Primm's got some new sheriff watching over the town now.
GID00029965	The NCR's all over Primm. Steer clear.
GID00029966	Somebody whacked the NCR president. Got what was coming to him.
GID00029967	Someone took out the Legion's boss. Doubt it'll stop them for long, though.
GID00029968	Lot more troops on the road these days. Wonder what's up.
GID00029969	Best to lay low. The NCR and the Legion are about to have it out.
GID00029970	You and me are all right.
GID00029971	Good to know that you've got my back.
GID00029972	Don't let the NCR catch up to you, all right?
GID00029973	You seem to be on the level.
GID00029974	Heard some things about you. Good things.
GID00029975	Guess we're on the same side.
GID00029976	I respect you, but I want nothing to do with you.
GID00029977	I've heard some crazy stories about you.
GID00029978	Whatever is you want, keep me out of it. I've heard the stories.
GID00029979	I don't think I'll be turning my back to you anytime soon.
GID00029980	Keep your hands where I can see them - makes me feel better.
GID00029981	You make it hard to trust you, you know that?
GID00029982	You better be sleeping with one eye open.
GID00029983	Why are you even talking to me?
GID00029984	I'd kill you right now if I could.
GID00029985	You're not exactly making friends around here, are you?
GID00029986	You and I have got nothing to talk about.
GID00029987	Just keep on walking.
GID00029988	Holy fuck. Never seen a mutant like that before.
GID00029989	Didn't know they still had robo-dogs around.
GID00029990	Wouldn't want to live forever if I had to look like a ghoul.
GID00029991	That guy's got cold eyes. Definitely ex-military.
GID00029992	Now there's a fine-looking woman. Just needs to ditch the robe.
GID00029993	Tough-looking woman. Something tells me she aims for the crotch.
GID00029994	We bought and sold guys like Four-Eyes over there like property back in the prison.
GID00029995	You eyeballing me?
GID00029996	Damn. Running low on smokes again.
GID00029997	Any lawman that comes after me won't have it easy.
GID00029998	Never gets old when something blows up.
GID00029999	No way I'm going back to prison.
GID00030000	Holy fuck. Never seen a mutant like that before.
GID00030001	That guy's got cold eyes. Definitely ex-military.
GID00030002	Tough-looking woman. Something tells me she aims for the crotch.
GID00030003	You and me are all right.
GID00030004	Good to know that you've got my back.
GID00030005	Don't let the NCR catch up to you, all right?
GID00030006	You seem to be on the level.
GID00030007	Heard some things about you. Good things.
GID00030008	Guess we're on the same side.
GID00030009	I respect you, but I want nothing to do with you.
GID00030010	I've heard some crazy stories about you.
GID00030011	Whatever is you want, keep me out of it. I've heard the stories.
GID00030012	I don't think I'll be turning my back to you anytime soon.
GID00030013	Keep your hands where I can see them - makes me feel better.
GID00030014	You make it hard to trust you, you know that?
GID00030015	You better be sleeping with one eye open.
GID00030016	Why are you even talking to me?
GID00030017	I'd kill you right now if I could.
GID00030018	You're not exactly making friends around here, are you?
GID00030019	You and I have got nothing to talk about.
GID00030020	Just keep on walking.
GID00030021	You eyeballing me?
GID00030022	Damn. Running low on smokes again.
GID00030023	Never gets old when something blows up.
GID00030024	Wouldn't mind having one of those little flying robots myself.
GID00030025	The Lucky 38's all lit up because someone infiltrated the El Dorado and flipped a switch. I'd shoot those lights out if I could.
GID00030026	You ever think about being a Ranger?
GID00030027	I'd gladly fight at your side.
GID00030028	You got my respect.
GID00030029	That a pretty gal! Want to share?Ha ha ha!
GID00030030	We got ourselves a little Ranger family reunion now. Time's right for a feud.
GID00030031	Hell of a place, huh?
GID00030032	Staying long?
GID00030033	A veteran Ranger inspires awe. Stick around for when they get here, you'll see. If I live to earn the Black Armor, I can die a happy woman.
GID00030034	First Recon's in Camp Forlorn Hope. Get some Rangers in there too and it'll be a damned impregnable fortress.
GID00030035	Wish I could've been there, defending Camp Forlorn Hope. Even if it didn't change anything.
GID00030036	Looks like we booted the Legion outta Nelson. About damn time.
GID00030037	From here on out, we fight for Chief Hanlon.
GID00030038	President Kimball was a tough son-of-a-gun. The Rangers'll pick up where he left off.
GID00030039	President Kimball was a soldier's soldier. It's up to us to make the Legion pay for what they did.
GID00030040	You saved President Kimball, didn't you? Hell of a thing.
GID00030041	Don't get many chances to catch a legionary alive. Burns me up that we botched ours.
GID00030042	All you need is one Ranger protecting the monorail. You don't even need to feed him that much. He'll get it done.
GID00030043	Wish I had a First Recon guy looking after me.
GID00030044	Hoover Dam... just thinking about it makes me nervous.
GID00030045	One of the Ranger vets looked at me and I just about surrendered.
GID00030046	The Ranger vets are on their way from Baja. Never seen one before. But I've heard they chew nails and spit napalm.
GID00030047	We put our trust in Hanlon and look where it got us. Makes you wonder if we can trust anyone at all.
GID00030048	Chief Hanlon's watching over us now. He won't let us lose.
GID00030049	They got to President Kimball. How long can we hold out?
GID00030050	Oh my God, are you the one who saved President Kimball?
GID00030051	I heard we captured a live Centurion and then let him get away. That never would've happened if I was in charge.
GID00030052	When I got this assignment I was hoping there'd be more gambling.
GID00030053	Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter.
GID00030054	Why don't you go join the rest of the human trash across the river?
GID00030055	Come on. Give me a reason.
GID00030056	Shooting you right now might be worth the court-martial.
GID00030057	I suggest you leave.
GID00030058	Keep walking.
GID00030059	You got a lot of nerve walking around here.
GID00030060	You need to get your head straight. If you're fighting for us, act like it.
GID00030061	You're insane. We shouldn't be letting you run loose around here.
GID00030062	How are we supposed to trust you? You're completely unpredictable.
GID00030063	Everything you've been up to... I just don't know what you're trying to pull.
GID00030064	At least the Legion knows what they're fighting for. When are you gonna figure it out?
GID00030065	Why don't you pick a side? We did.
GID00030066	Honored to speak with you, sir.
GID00030067	Honored to speak with you, ma'am.
GID00030068	You know, if you were serving, you'd probably be halfway to general by now.
GID00030069	Nice job out there.
GID00030070	Glad you're with us.
GID00030071	Hey. Welcome aboard.
GID00030072	I'm not sure you should be here.
GID00030073	You lost?
GID00030074	We won't go quietly. The Legion can count on that.
GID00030075	Sounds like we're running Primm now. I'd still rather take my leave at the Strip.
GID00030076	First Recon's at Camp Forlorn Hope. Now we've got a chance to hold it.
GID00030077	Nelson's back in our hands. I hope we can defend it this time.
GID00030078	Is it me, or has the Brotherhood stopped engaging us? Smartest move they ever made, you ask me.
GID00030079	Smart move for the Kings to back down. They didn't know who they were messing with.
GID00030080	We signed a treaty with the Great Khans. Guess you can never have too many lowlife chem dealers on your side.
GID00030081	Sickens me that the Legion would try to harvest slaves from a refugee camp.
GID00030082	President Kimball is lucky he escaped. I don't think we could lose him right now.
GID00030083	Wish I could've been there to see Caesar die. What an asshole.
GID00030084	Monster of the East, huh? Well I've got the Monster of the West in my holster right now. Hope I get to introduce them.
GID00030085	Got business here?
GID00030086	Keeping the Strip secure has been hell since the monorail was taken out.
GID00030087	Did you hear about that Legion POW escape? I don't like our chances of taking him alive twice.
GID00030088	They're talking about you on the radio. Saving President Kimball. I'm impressed.
GID00030089	How could we lose Kimball at a time like this?
GID00030090	Chief Hanlon was a model soldier. We all looked up to him.
GID00030091	Too bad about Chief Hanlon. He did what he thought was best for us.
GID00030092	Without Camp Forlorn Hope, it's a matter of time before the Legion surrounds us at the Dam.
GID00030093	This whole war's gonna change when the Ranger veterans get here. Soon as we see the Black Armor, we can all breathe easier.
GID00030094	A platoon of veteran Rangers is like a tactical nuke, only tougher to scare.
GID00030095	This battle... everything's riding on it.
GID00030096	That red beret's looking good, soldier.
GID00030097	The security lapse with the monorail is a huge embarrassment.
GID00030098	That POW escape presents some real security concerns. That was our base camp, for crying out loud.
GID00030099	There's something fishy about how Chief Hanlon died. It just doesn't add up.
GID00030100	Can't believe Hanlon was working against us.
GID00030101	No hope of securing the border now that Forlorn Hope fell.
GID00030102	The Ranger veterans have been running ops in Baja. We'll be a different army with them here.
GID00030103	We've got our best Rangers here now. All of a sudden I like our chances a whole lot better.
GID00030104	If we lose Hoover Dam, we can kiss Nevada goodbye.
GID00030105	With House dead, we'll have Vegas annexed before the year's out.
GID00030106	It's been a long tour. All I can think about now is going back home.
GID00030107	You new to Freeside? Haven't seen you around.
GID00030108	You looking to join the Kings?
GID00030109	Do I know you? Whatever.
GID00030110	I hear you're working out pretty well. The King's taken a shine to you.
GID00030111	Stick by the Kings, and the Kings'll stick by you.
GID00030112	I've been hearing good things about you. Keep it up.
GID00030113	Hey pal, what's shaking?
GID00030114	You're okay in my book.
GID00030115	Hey there. You should stop by Freeside more often.
GID00030116	You got guts, showing your face around here.
GID00030117	You're lucky the King's a forgiving man.
GID00030118	I don't need to talk to you.
GID00030119	I wish you never came to Freeside.
GID00030120	Back again? What's next, burn down the Wrangler?
GID00030121	You're not wanted around here. Scram.
GID00030122	Some people seem to think you've helped the community, but I have my doubts.
GID00030123	There's talk of you being a menace, but I think you mean well.
GID00030124	Well, you definitely accomplished some things here, but I can't tell if Freeside is better for it or not.
GID00030125	You have got to be the craziest asshole I've ever met.
GID00030126	A couple of us started a pool trying to guess what you've going to do next.
GID00030127	Don't take this the wrong way, but are you, like, crazy or something?
GID00030128	Heard there was some excitement in one of the casinos in the Strip. Bunch of people got hurt when some nut started attacking people.
GID00030129	Things are tense on the Strip right now. The head of one of Mr. House's Families was killed. Time to lay low, you ask me.
GID00030130	Some nut attempted to kill the head of one of Mr. House's Families recently. Whoever did it is either crazy or has balls the size of Freeside.
GID00030131	Did you hear someone managed to fight their way through the Chairmen and flee the Strip after being caught? Wonder if they're hiding out in Freeside.
GID00030132	Looks like Gomorrah's under new management. I wonder what happened?
GID00030133	There's talk of someone going into the Lucky 38 to talk to Mr. House. That's bullshit. Everyone knows Mr. House doesn't talk to anyone.
GID00030134	Man, I thought those tin cans of Mr. House's were tough before. Have you seen the shit they can do now?
GID00030135	Turns out Mr. House wasn't so safe up in his tower after all!
GID00030136	I wonder how Mr. House died. I figure it wasn't old age.
GID00030137	How are we supposed to sleep with the Lucky 38 lit up 24/7?
GID00030138	Holy crap! You're the one they're saying killed the Legion honcho right?
GID00030139	Word on the street is that the leader of the Legion bought it. Too bad, someone was finally going to do something about all the NCR around here.
GID00030140	You hear how Mr. House said "uncle?" Vegas is gonna join the NCR. So much for Freeside.
GID00030141	Did you hear? Someone bombed the monorail down at McCarran, so everyone's been forced to come through here to get to the Strip. Business is booming.
GID00030142	Seems like they've got things straightened out in McCarran now, but we're still seeing a big increase in traffic here.
GID00030143	I can't believe someone stopped the NCR president from getting killed. If anyone deserves it, it's that jerk.
GID00030144	Someone took a shot at the NCR president, but the lucky bastard got away. Oh well, it was a good try.
GID00030145	Hey, did you hear the NCR president got whacked? Good for whoever did it, I say. Couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.
GID00030146	There's mutterings from the NCR people around here that some local hero of theirs died. Whatever.
GID00030147	Turns out some military hero the Squatters admired was actually a slimeball. An NCR soldier who's actually a dick? Who would've thought?
GID00030148	Heh, word is the leader of the Fiends got taken down. I would have done it myself, it he ever had the courage to step into Freeside.
GID00030149	I heard that some of the bosses of the Fiends were killed. Wouldn't be surprised if the NCR had something to do with it.
GID00030150	You hear the Legion attacked Bitter Springs? If we're lucky, the NCR will pull some of their soldiers away from here and send them that way.
GID00030151	Word is the Khans signed a treaty with the NCR. Never saw that coming.
GID00030152	The Khans used to be a big deal around here, but look at them now. There's talk that they were all killed up in the mountains.
GID00030153	Weird, someone just told me that the Khans split the Vegas area. Wonder where they went, and why.
GID00030154	I can't believe the King is dead. What's going to happen to us now?
GID00030155	If you had asked me a month ago, I'd have said we'd never willingly work with the NCR. But look at us now.
GID00030156	I still can't believe the King agreed to work with the NCR. But he's the King, and the King knows best.
GID00030157	So far working with the NCR hasn't been too bad. If anything, things seem to be getting better.
GID00030158	Great, just when you think the NCR can't possibly sink their claws deeper, the town of Primm signs up to join the Republic.
GID00030159	Sounds like the NCR and the Legion are both gearing up for a fight. We've been seeing a lot more soldiers around.
GID00030160	The big showdown between the NCR and the Legion is coming soon, believe you me.
GID00030161	I heard some Squatters talking about some fancy pants Rangers coming into the area soon. Like we need more NCR here.
GID00030162	Word is those tough guys rangers are here. I ain't seen them myself, but how scary can they be?
GID00030163	Everyone's talking about Hoover Dam nowadays. I wish the battle would just happen already. The suspense is killing me.
GID00030164	Hey, isn't that the King's dog?
GID00030165	Heya Rex, how you doing boy?
GID00030166	I see you've hired a Follower doctor. Smart move, Freeside being what it is.
GID00030167	That friend of yours NCR? He looks like he's NCR.
GID00030168	Hellooo, cowgirl! You mind if talk to your lady friend a bit instead of you?
GID00030169	Huh. Nice robot. You with the Followers or something?
GID00030170	Whoa. That's a whole lotta mutant you got with you there. Still, long as it doesn't cause trouble it's all good.
GID00030171	Nice to see a human palling around with a ghoul. I see a lot of people around here avoid them.
GID00030172	Your girl's kinda cute, but not my type at all. I don't go for smart chicks.
GID00030173	Watch yourself. There's some unsavory types about.
GID00030174	The Squatters have been more and more trouble lately.
GID00030175	Man, I'm hungry. I'd give anything for a Fancy Lad. Wait, I mean- you know what I mean!
GID00030176	Squatters aren't happy about the water rationing, but then when are they ever happy?
GID00030177	It's gotten so bad that even I think twice before going out at night around here.
GID00030178	The bodyguards at the gates aren't so bad. Except that Orris guy. That bastard runs his mouth a little too much.
GID00030179	Can't wait to hit the Wrangler tonight. Just me and my favorite girl.
GID00030180	I've been saving up for one of those sweet pistols at the Silver Rush. That'll get me some respect.
GID00030181	Saw a guy try to rush through the south gate a few days ago. Nothin' left but dust, you know?
GID00030182	Those Squatters think they're entitled to everything.
GID00030183	Man, I still can't believe the Van Graffs took Pacer out.
GID00030184	Shame about Pacer. We all tried to tell him to kick the habit, with that condition of his. He always did his own thing, I'll give him that.
GID00030185	I used to guard at the gate, but there's no money in it these days. Only the big name guards get any business.
GID00030186	Thank god the Followers are here. I'd probably be dead now if it weren't for their doctors.
GID00030187	It's never dull in Freeside, is it?
GID00030188	Heya, what's shakin'?
GID00030189	Hey there.
GID00030190	What's going on?
GID00030191	They tell me I'm supposed to sell you weapons. Interested?
GID00030192	What's up with the tower in Vegas being all lit up? I didn't know it could do that.
GID00030193	Even that old House bastard gave in to the NCR. We're the only ones to make a stand!
GID00030194	What are we going to do now that Papa's dead?
GID00030195	Your friend's cute - is she single?
GID00030196	I hope Papa knew what he was doing when he left you in charge.
GID00030197	A robot dog? Never seen one of those before.
GID00030198	Your pal's one ugly motherfucker.
GID00030199	Holy hell, is that a Nightkin?
GID00030200	Nice robot.
GID00030201	You know you're traveling with a fucking murderer?
GID00030202	Haven't seen a Follower around here in years.
GID00030203	Huh?
GID00030204	What?
GID00030205	I ought to bleed you.
GID00030206	Fuck off and die.
GID00030207	Like we don't have enough problems.
GID00030208	Just get the fuck out of here.
GID00030209	What the fuck are you doing showing your face here?
GID00030210	Why are you even here?
GID00030211	Crazy-ass mother fucker.
GID00030212	You been dosing on too many of Jack's chems?
GID00030213	You're almost as crazy as some Fiends I know.
GID00030214	Oh great, just who I wanted to see.
GID00030215	You going to fuck shit up again?
GID00030216	What do you want this time?
GID00030217	You should have been with us in our glory days. You'd have loved it.
GID00030218	Share a whiskey with me sometime?
GID00030219	I wish there were more like you.
GID00030220	I like you, stranger. You've stood by us when not many would.
GID00030221	Good to see you again.
GID00030222	Why'd you come here?
GID00030223	Come to gawk at the Great Khans, have you? Fuck off.
GID00030224	What do you want?
GID00030225	The Legion and the NCR have mobilized their forces at Hoover Dam - it'll be time soon.
GID00030226	It's starting to feel like tensions are coming to a boil. There will be full-scale war soon.
GID00030227	Seems like everybody with a stake in the Mojave is gearing up for something big.
GID00030228	So you've been sucked into the decadence of the Strip as well, have you?
GID00030229	Caesar's veterans are making short work of the NCR - or that's what I hear.
GID00030230	Soon Caesar will send in his best troops from the Arizona campaign - the NCR won't know what hit them.
GID00030231	Those black-armored devils might be new to the Mojave, but they're butchers like all the rest.
GID00030232	The runners are saying that the NCR is sending in their elite shock troops to try and push back the Legion.
GID00030233	NCR spreads its infection to another town, I hear.
GID00030234	I'm glad our brothers have returned home from Boulder City.
GID00030235	Why did you kill our brothers in Boulder City?
GID00030236	More Khan brothers cut down by NCR in Boulder City. We should kill a hundred of them in response!
GID00030237	The 1st Recon butchers are in the field again. I'd love to head down to Forlorn hope and show them we haven't forgotten.
GID00030238	So the NCR makes peace with the Kings now? Where was that mercy at Bitter Springs?
GID00030239	Another tribe was wiped out in NCR territory? Can't say I'm surprised. I hope the surviving Kings learn from this.
GID00030240	Our tribe's final stand will be remembered for a thousand years!
GID00030241	We'll return, stronger than before!
GID00030242	I can't believe they're all gone.
GID00030243	So the Legion hit the murderers at Bitter Springs? Good.
GID00030244	We're not moving as many chems now that the Fiends have been taken out.
GID00030245	Diane's going nuts trying to find a new contact in the Fiends now that Motor Runner's dead.
GID00030246	Typical - even within their highest ranks, the NCR is corrupt.
GID00030247	So, the big bad chief ranger couldn't take the pressure, huh? Good.
GID00030248	If I knew who killed Kimball, I'd buy him a drink.
GID00030249	If you're going to assassinate the president of the NCR, you could at least do it right.
GID00030250	Why the hell would you stop someone from killing Kimball?
GID00030251	If you ask me, a true warrior wouldn't let himself be captured at all - but busting that Legionnaire out of McCarran was an impressive stunt.
GID00030252	I would have thought the monorail bombing would slow the NCR down more.
GID00030253	Whoever blew up that monorail is a damn hero.
GID00030254	Karl's been in a shitty mood since that big explosion at the Fort.
GID00030255	Word's spreading that Caesar is dead. No one seems to know much about how, though.
GID00030256	Caesar can rot in hell for all I care.
GID00030257	Not many get the favor of Caesar - even Papa hasn't been to the Fort.
GID00030258	Rumor from the Strip is that House is dead. I hope the old bastard choked on his own tongue.
GID00030259	Mr. House isn't a man to be trusted. Watch yourself.
GID00030260	I heard from one of Melissa's runners that that check-coated bastard got thrown out on his ass.
GID00030261	Papa says "cut off the head and the snake will die." I guess the Chairmen's days are numbered.
GID00030262	I remember the Chairmen from their tribal days. They were punks then, they're punks now.
GID00030263	You really killed Caesar himself? Maybe he's not the mighty warrior Karl said he was.
GID00030264	You're the one who killed Kimball! If we had a bar here, I'd buy you a drink!
GID00030265	We're fighting for the NCR now? I don't know about that....
GID00030266	Yeah?
GID00030267	I hear the NCR and the Kings have been getting along. That's good news for Freeside.
GID00030268	I hear the Legion's fixing to attack Hoover Dam. Good thing I ain't there.
GID00030269	I hear the Great Khans just packed up and left Red Rock Canyon. Always thought the NCR and them would fight it out again.
GID00030270	That President Kimball nearly got killed at Hoover Dam. Now he knows how we feel about the NCR around here.
GID00030271	That tower on the Strip, the one you can see for miles? I hear it ain't sealed-up no more.
GID00030272	Nelson and Camp Forlorn Hope, both butchered. It's almost like God don't like either side.
GID00030273	Some Khans got corned in the ruins of Boulder City and the NCR killed them. It's like Bitter Springs all over again.
GID00030274	Someone finally put down that sick Motor Runner sonofabitch. Good riddance.
GID00030275	So I hear the honcho of one of them Strip families up and disappeared - poof! Yeah, they'll find his body someday...
GID00030276	The bosses of the Omergas? Omer-nas? The ones that run Gomorrah? Someone killed them.
GID00030277	I hear someone went crazy in one of the casinos on the Strip, shot the place up or something!
GID00030278	The honcho of one of them Strip families got killed right in his own casino. You know he pissed off the wrong guy!
GID00030279	You hear there was some kinda shoot-out at one of them casinos on the Strip? Some people got killed or something.
GID00030280	They say those robots on the Strip are running around with different faces or something. Don't ask, because I don't know...
GID00030281	Those robots on the Strip, Securi-troids or what have you? Well, they been acting different or something.
GID00030282	The same robots on the Strip, I seen one or two of them roll past town time to time. Well, the face on them looked meaner.
GID00030283	Usually I don't talk to nobody but robots. But lately some of them been two-faced.
GID00030284	A customer who been to the Strip told me the faces on the robots there changed from police to soldiers. Now why would that be?
GID00030285	That Mr. House who lorded over the Strip is dead. Good riddance, I say.
GID00030286	Now that Mr. House's gone, might be opportunities on the Strip for an enterprising merchant.
GID00030287	I bet that Mr. House had a buncha booze in his place. Someone oughta get it out of there. He ain't using it!
GID00030288	If Caesar's dead, why ain't the NCR taking care of regular folks yet?
GID00030289	You hear Caesar's dead? Good for trade if the Legion goes away, that's for sure.
GID00030290	I heard Caesar didn't let nobody drink or drug. Probably why he got killed.
GID00030291	Who cares if Caesar's dead? Don't affect our town one bit.
GID00030292	If the NCR ain't got to worry about Caesar no more, it should worry about improving the lives of regular folks around here.
GID00030293	So much for the might of the NCR! Their President got killed over at Hoover Dam!
GID00030294	You hear how the President of the NCR got killed? Gonna be hard to score chems around here for a while...
GID00030295	Someone tried to kill the NCR President over at Hoover Dam. They say it was Legion.
GID00030296	How's the NCR gonna protect Vegas if it can't even protect its own President?
GID00030297	The NCR's top Ranger, Chief Hanlon, put a gun in his mouth. Think he would've done that if the NCR stood a chance at beating the Legion?
GID00030298	Turns out the NCR's top Ranger was a traitor! If the Legion can turn a man like Hanlon, what chance has the NCR got?
GID00030299	You hear the Legion attacked Bitter Springs? Didn't know there was anything left there to attack.
GID00030300	Those Fiend junkies over at Vault 3 been taking some hits. I say kill them all.
GID00030301	With fewer of them Fiends sucking up the chems, maybe I can finally score a hit now and then.
GID00030302	With those Fiends on the run, I should head over to Vault 3 and see if I can pull some salvage out of there.
GID00030303	The Great Khans signing a treaty with the NCR? I never woulda seen that coming.
GID00030304	Have you seen that tower on the Strip all lit up? You can see it for miles!
GID00030305	The Great Khans up and left Red Rock Canyon. Who's gonna brew fresh chems now?
GID00030306	I hear the Great Khans got massacred again. No survivors this time, though.
GID00030307	They say the Kings got massacred. Who's gonna watch over Freeside now?
GID00030308	The NCR took back Nelson. Maybe they can win this war after all.
GID00030309	First the Legion takes Nelson, then it wipes out Camp Forlorn Hope. The NCR don't stand a chance.
GID00030310	There was some kind of massacre at one of the Ranger Stations. I don't know which one.
GID00030311	Some Khans got cornered in the ruins of Boulder City, but the NCR let them go. That's unusual.
GID00030312	Primm has a new Sheriff. That should keep the Powder Gangers away.
GID00030313	Primm wimped out and accepted NCR rule. Some people will do anything to feel safe.
GID00030314	Looks like the war's ratcheting up. I hear the NCR's bringing in elite troops.
GID00030315	They say the Legion's bringing in Veterans from out in Arizona. They must be getting ready to attack.
GID00030316	You ever seen one of those Rangers in black armor? I wouldn't want to make one of those mad!
GID00030317	You ever seen one of those Rangers in black armor? I wouldn't want to make one of those mad!
GID00030318	I hear reports of Legion raiding parties all over the place. They can't all be rumors!
GID00030319	I keep hearing about some courier making a fuss over at the Strip. Must've delivered more than just mail.
GID00030320	Mark my words - won't be long before the Legion and NCR butt heads over Hoover Dam.
GID00030321	Nobody knows who's gonna win, Legion or NCR. Might not make much of a difference around here.
GID00030322	That tower on the Strip's lit up night and day now! What's it mean?
GID00030323	Goddamn that Mr. House for selling Vegas out to the NCR! The whole Mojave will have to join up.
GID00030324	Howdy.
GID00030325	Hey there.
GID00030326	The recent disturbance at the Tops has been resolved. Do not be afraid to patronize the Tops.
GID00030327	The recent disturbance at Gomorrah has been resolved. Do not be afraid to patronize Gomorrah.
GID00030328	Be advised, the Lucky 38 is not open to the general public. Trespassers will be shot. Thank you.
GID00030329	Do not be alarmed. We have been upgraded to serve you better. Have a nice day.

GID00030331	Be advised, Mr. House has voluntarily decided to become a citizen of the NCR.
GID00030332	Sovereignty over the Vegas Strip will be transferred to the NCR at a date yet to be determined. Have a nice day.
GID00030333	Be advised, when Mr. House transfers sovereignty over the Vegas Strip to the NCR, he will remain its sole proprietor. Have a nice day.
GID00030334	The unfortunate incident involving the monorail from McCarran Airport is being resolved as quickly as possible. Thank you.
GID00030335	Be sure to offer words of encouragement to NCR men and women in uniform. Vegas appreciates their business.
GID00030336	Be advised, NCR President Aaron Kimball survived an assassination attempt at Hoover Dam.
GID00030337	Just one more reason to celebrate at one of New Vegas's fine casinos! Thank you.
GID00030338	Be advised, NCR President Aaron Kimball was struck down in a cowardly attack at Hoover Dam.
GID00030339	The Strip offers many fine cocktail lounges where grieving persons may drown their sorrows.
GID00030340	Welcome to Vegas, capital of the sixth state of the New California Republic!
GID00030341	True to Caesar.
GID00030342	Welcome to New Vegas, where a new day is dawning!
GID00030343	Welcome to Vegas. Don't make trouble.
GID00030344	Welcome to the Vegas Strip.
GID00030345	Enjoy all the Vegas Strip has to offer.
GID00030346	Enjoy your time on the Vegas Strip.
GID00030347	Always a pleasure.
GID00030348	Good to see you.
GID00030349	Hello, again.
GID00030350	Hey, look who's here!
GID00030351	If it isn't our favorite V.I.P.!
GID00030352	You're always welcome in this town!
GID00030353	Try to control your behavior today.
GID00030354	I'm hoping this is one of your good days.
GID00030355	Vegas doesn't need your trouble.
GID00030356	Who knows what you're going to do next?
GID00030357	I bet you're up to something.
GID00030358	I don't like the look of you. Never have.
GID00030359	Don't think we aren't watching you.
GID00030360	You've got a reputation in this town, and it isn't a good one.
GID00030361	Don't bother to watch yourself. We're watching for you.
GID00030362	Come on, tough guy/gal - give me a reason.
GID00030363	Take your best shot. Then we'll take ours.
GID00030364	You're bad for Vegas. You don't belong here.
GID00030365	Goodbye.
GID00030366	Have a nice day.
GID00030367	Enjoy your time in Vegas.

GID00030371	I'm sorry, but I am not at liberty to chat right now.
GID00030372	Protect and serve.
GID00030373	Protect and serve.
GID00030374	Yeah? What do you want?
GID00030375	What's up?
GID00030376	Hi there, mister. You need something?
GID00030377	Hi there, miss. Can I help you with something?
GID00030378	Hello again. Did you need something else?
GID00030379	I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
GID00030380	I doubt I can help you. I'm just a kid, you know.
GID00030381	I'll mind my business, you mind yours.
GID00030382	I've got nothing to say to you. Best move on.
GID00030383	What do you need?
GID00030384	I've got nothing to say to you. Best move on.
GID00030385	You don't seem to take a hint. Get out of my face.
GID00030386	Jesus, you really can't take a hint, can you?
GID00030387	Let me be blunt. Go away.
GID00030388	I don't know you, you don't know me. Let's keep it that way.
GID00030389	How about you just mind your own business, okay?
GID00030390	They're hoarding our water! How are we supposed to survive the desert, huh?
GID00030391	Hope those greedy bastards rot in foul water.
GID00030392	One of these days, we're going to teach them a good lesson.
GID00030393	We'll be back. They can't step over our people forever.
GID00030394	Those hillbillies think they can take our water. We bring civilization, and this is how they repay us.
GID00030395	Damned rats. Next time I see them, I swear, I'll aim right between their eyes.
GID00030396	They've got no right to come near our outposts. This is NCR territory, now.
GID00030397	I almost pity them, these desert savages.
GID00030398	We'll get back our water, and our land, one of these days. We'll be mean to those soldiers until they leave!
GID00030399	They're asking for it, those people from the NCR. We're tough, here! They don't scare us.
GID00030400	This desert is our home!
GID00030401	We've lived here a long time! We're not going to leave our home.
GID00030402	They're mean! Don't want to share water with us.
GID00030403	You must be very special to Mr. House, huh?
GID00030404	How did you get in there?
GID00030405	Wow... I've never seen anyone go into the Lucky 38 before.
GID00030406	Don't mind me. I was just passing by.
GID00030407	I bet everyone's going to hear about you going into the 38.
GID00030408	My pals said nobody has ever been inside the Lucky 38.
GID00030409	Hey, sexy, come by the Tops later. I'd love to hear your story.
GID00030410	Whatcha want, freakshow?
GID00030411	Who the fuck are you and why are you bothering me?
GID00030412	Back again? Jesus....
GID00030413	Come back to Violet, huh? What now?
GID00030414	Something on your mind?
GID00030415	Hey there, sweet thing. Want a ride on the Cook-Cook express?
GID00030416	Hi. I'm Frewell
GID00030417	Fretwell again, brah.
GID00030418	Frettie, a thirtie.
GID00030419	Yo, I'm Willis, trooper Willis to you, punk.
GID00030420	Me again, ahole!
GID00030421	Why not?
GID00030422	Henchman number 1, yeah.
GID00030423	Henchman number 2 bro!
GID00030424	Don't go messing around with the Fiends.
GID00030425	We ain't here to help you, get out.
GID00030426	What the hell are you doing here? Civilians shouldn't be here.
GID00030427	It's not safe around here.
GID00030428	Try not to get killed, okay?
GID00030429	You should go topside.
