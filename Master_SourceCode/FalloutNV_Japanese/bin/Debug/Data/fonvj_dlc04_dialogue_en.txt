GID00094426	Mayday, mayday, mayday! This is NCR Trooper Gleeson calling anyone listening on this channel.
GID00094427	My platoon has been wiped out, and I am pinned down by a goddamn huge Deathclaw in a place called the Divide!
GID00094428	So far I've been able to scare it away with flares, but I lack any explosives to kill the damn thing! Please assist! I say again, please assist!

GID00094439	<Inquisitive beeping>
GID00094440	[SUCCEEDED] No... no, I couldn't. And I'm thinking you can't kill me, either. If you did, you'd answer for it, just as I would.
GID00094441	Let the land do the killing for you, that's one of the things you taught me.
GID00094442	Killing is personal - so's vows, promises. Last bit's more important to me than the first.
GID00094443	[FAILED] Talking... words won't settle this. The Road will. And the end.
GID00094444	A question one could have asked you not long ago, before walking the road West into the storms.
GID00094445	Need to be here, see what was done. It's custom of the Bear to never see the marks it claws in the land... not my custom.
GID00094446	Maybe that's why you've come, too - need to see where the missile from Ashton touched ground down below, in Hopeville... the Courier's Mile.
GID00094447	Need to be here, see what was done. In the Divide, in Hopeville... the Courier's Mile.
GID00094448	No, opposite of that. It's where my tribe was taken. Where another history was put to the blade, lesson taught.
GID00094449	It is where we realized Vulpes did not approach us as equals. Where we realized the wolf had come, and we watched our history die.
GID00094450	Now it belongs to Legion... and all the death there now belongs to them as well. Not revenge... just the way of things when you own them.
GID00094451	No damage done, not yet. Maybe in years. Keeps the Bear fenced... if Caesar can't drive it back, fire might.
GID00094452	Only delays the end for the Bull, a new wall for them to scale and cross... once they're done with the Mojave. And Hoover Dam.
GID00094453	Never again do you or any other courier and caravan need walk that route. Let the Mojave breathe without that asphalt scar raking it.
GID00094454	Name's died twice to history. If the West thanks you... the East won't, in time. Fall apart, back to the tribes, maybe.
GID00094455	Name's died twice to history. If the West thanks you... the East won't, in time. Fall apart, back to the tribes, maybe.
GID00094456	Let's see what gifts the Mojave has for us.
GID00094457	Let's make something new from the old.
GID00094458	Not a camp - vigil, maybe. Never claimed it as mine. If anyone owns the Divide... your claim is stronger than mine.
GID00094459	Don't feel like adding a campfire to the ones that already burn below. If you brought Mojave gifts, might be able to shape something for the road.
GID00094460	Depends what history has to say about them. There's a lot the land can provide... if you know the road that led to it.
GID00094461	Mojave's got ways of healing most ills - if not, some tribe's usually found a way you didn't expect.
GID00094462	Like Healing Powders. Tribes back West only use Xander and Broc flower. There's a way the Twin Mothers in the East used to brew it, though.
GID00094463	Called it Bitter Drink, mixed up the Xander and Broc in a bottle, added some kick to it so your head doesn't get all clouded.
GID00094464	Antivenom's helpful around the Mojave with the Bark Scorpions. Even one sting can kill you. Tunneler bite can be just as bad.
GID00094465	My tribe, Twisted Hairs, had a better way than Antivenom, if you act fast.
GID00094466	Snakebite Tourniquet - cuts off the venom, no need to scavenge glands and blood. Or drink that mess.
GID00094467	Part of the reason we wore our hair like we did, like I do now.
GID00094468	Here's some for the road - trick to making it's not hard. Get bit, hook and twist it. Fast as blinking, doesn't give poison time to sink in.
GID00094469	Nothing more than I've already shared. We'll have to keep with what we know. Tired of history's lessons, anyway.
GID00094470	Didn't think I'd be breathing to hear you say that. Message isn't important, meaning is.
GID00094471	Had to speak of it, in case the words got lost in paper, ink, or other's voices. Maybe even yours, in time.
GID00094472	Still, meant for you. Courier to Courier. Belongs to you now, or history. Doesn't matter.
GID00094473	House spoke, acted through machines. Sometimes can judge a man by his messengers. Sometimes the messengers judge him.
GID00094474	Wonder what happens to Vegas now. The tribes - families. We'll see.
GID00094475	<Confirmatory beeping>
GID00094476	Nothing but wind, sand... ash. More may reveal itself in time, not now.
GID00094477	If you're determined, return, might be something new surfaces.
GID00094478	Wind and blood has uncovered more beneath the soil.
GID00094479	If you want these Old World relics, they're yours... better you carry them than the Marked Men.
GID00094480	Walk there sometimes, keep the walks short. Still... it's important to see. Something else to answer for.
GID00094481	Occasionally sift through the dust, the buildings... see if I can find some history. Marks of America.
GID00094482	If you want them, keep them... you've earned it. Nothing to be gained by me holding them, and more will surface in time.
GID00094483	[SUCCEEDED] Words aren't the only way couriers meet... sometimes it's the paths we walk. But no... we've never spoken before now.
GID00094484	[FAILED] I know you. What we have in common, though, isn't in the words we traded.
GID00094485	<Happy beeping>
GID00094486	Careful, Tommy - I've never seen a robot like that before. It might be dangerous.
GID00094487	I don't know, son... what if someone comes looking for it?
GID00094488	All right, boy. But if he breaks anything, it's coming out of your allowance!

GID00094561	I've been to your home, the place you kept returning to... may not be the place you were born, was the place you gave life to, same thing.
GID00094562	People forget couriers can keep communities alive... until the day they're gone, and their breath catches in their throat.
GID00094563	For now, eyes alert, watch the streets below. There's still life in the Divide - threats other than the storms and wind... new inhabitants.
GID00094564	RALPHIE, hurry! If mean old General Winters catches you, you'll never make it home!

GID00094587	Heard tales of you walking the Mojave. Casting off your disguise... yet you carried that Chip, determined to take it to Vegas... not Caesar.
GID00094588	You and that Chip deserve each other, 29 fewer coins than other traitors have carried, by history's mark.
GID00094589	For now - find the trigger for the warheads, buried in Hopeville. Use it to keep moving... and keep alive.
GID00094590	They'll start emerging throughout the Mojave in time, might be years. Probably less.
GID00094591	They breed fast, hunt in groups, more than enough to bring down the strongest in the Mojave. Once they draw blood...
GID00094592	Seen them tear apart Deathclaws... Deathclaw might get some, but the rest will swarm it, tear it apart, like Denver hounds.
GID00094593	Walked the East, too, before the Bull came. Then... much like the Mojave before the Bear... tribes, towns, clutching to life. Bull did a better job.
GID00094594	[SUCCEEDED] <Pleased beeping>
GID00094595	[FAILED] <Confused beeping>
GID00094596	I'm a courier. Courier Six... was Courier Six. Like you - and not like you, in all the ways that matter.
GID00094597	Spent too many years looking for you - now, letting you come to me.
GID00094598	Thought carrying that Chip would end you, no... you got lives in you, hard to kill. Storms, bullets... sand and wind, yet still you walk. For now.
GID00094599	The idea of a machine bearing a message new to you? Thought that was how House relayed all his messages... through his robots.
GID00094600	The machine... the robot. No, not Legion... less history than that.
GID00094601	The robot with you... all of them are machines - radios, Old World tech reshaped with new hands. Historians. Couriers, carrying messages.
GID00094602	Seen them as I've walked the Divide, tending other machines. That one... sealed inside the Hopeville silo. Sign America is waking up.
GID00094603	It will follow you, obey you. Carry it until we are face to face, then there'll be no more need for it to carry my words.
GID00094604	[SUCCEEDED] America sleeps in the Divide - giants, beneath the earth. You saw one locked in the silo beneath you. There's more.
GID00094605	Only takes a few of them, locked below ground, to tear apart the earth... and cast dust, sand... ash... into the skies above.
GID00094606	[FAILED] Wasn't always like this. Old World wreckage's nothing new... after that, something you had your hand in - you'll walk it soon enough.
GID00094607	The Divide... this place is a slice of it. Old military. Can still smell the pride - and the fear.
GID00094608	Hope of the Old World, wrapped in fencing, covered in storm. Got new inhabitants now other than ghosts, more recent... recruits.
GID00094609	If you saw their corpses, you saw mercy. Got what they deserved, coming to the Divide.
GID00094610	The Bear and Bull - NCR, Legion - came in waves. Before. And after. Right into the invisible fires... the wind, ground... collapsing beneath them.
GID00094611	Once under different flags, now they are equal in their hatred of the trespassers. You and I.
GID00094612	America sleeps ahead of you, its nightmares filled with quakes, storms. You'll need to find your own path.
GID00094613	That means waking America's spears up from their slumber. There's ways - warheads set off the collapse, warheads could open the gates again.
GID00094614	You're resourceful. That machine, robot with you - can help you find the warheads you need to destroy... and their trigger, the detonator.
GID00094615	The way ahead is below. The tools are there. The rest - up to you.
GID00094616	Tunnelers. Predators that make their own roads beneath the ground here.
GID00094617	Divide broke their sky, showed them the world above - and the scent of new prey.
GID00094618	Be a slower death for the Mojave than bombs and fire... but they'll come for its people, from where they least expect - below.
GID00094619	No Courier would go to the Divide... but you will. And that's what sets us apart - we walk roads no other Courier will walk.
GID00094620	And for you... you'll want to see your home one last time, see what happened.
GID00094621	You're curious. You walk, leave ruin in your path... you can't leave alone. Still, the choice is yours... what I offer, it's the last I offer you.
GID00094622	I don't care if you walk the Divide. Turn, walk the Mojave, fight beneath the flags... but you'll wonder.
GID00094623	If you don't, the Divide will come to you, and the Mojave. That will be my message to you, like the message you had for me.
GID00094624	The Divide will send its worst against you - it may break you. We'll see if you're stronger.
GID00094625	Road gets rougher from here... Courier. Left marks for you, colors'll tell the way - if you're smart.
GID00094626	They'll lead you to your home one more time, lead to the ending of it - maybe remind you why you wander.
GID00094627	You haven't seen enough of the Legion yet to see what they worship... what they hold on to, even after what happened to them.
GID00094628	They bear false versions of Legate Lanius' mask, the one Caesar fashioned for him. Thought it was an insult at first.... know better now.
GID00094629	It's shaped from Divide metal, not with care and strength, but with hate. Keeps them anchored.
GID00094630	Crude, effective - like the blades they carry, distant mirrors of their Legate. A symbol they can hold on to - while the Divide tears at them.
GID00094631	You see true. Not scavengers... it's what they wore before this all happened.
GID00094632	Pain makes for strange allies... the hate the Bear and Bull shared across the battlefield, now turned against the Divide. Few survived... intact.
GID00094633	Many NCR were already here when the destruction happened. Keeping the route East open, in fear of Caesar. Fear of the Legion.
GID00094634	At the end of the High Road lies Ashton - its silo.
GID00094635	That machine with you, it can open it, wake it up, like it did the one in Hopeville.
GID00094636	[SUCCEEDED] Death'll come from below. In the Divide, need to watch the sky and ground... Mojave'll be easy prey for them.
GID00094637	[FAILED] Mojave needs to survive itself first... does that, Tunnelers will be next on the list.
GID00094638	[SUCCEEDED] Maybe not. Who's to say.
GID00094639	You, perhaps. Found them, heard them after I cast them aside - maybe there was purpose in that.
GID00094640	If they matter... if history matters... we'll see at the end of the road.
GID00094641	[FAILED] Words lost to history. Wouldn't have left them on the road otherwise.
GID00094642	I know that now. Doesn't change what was done. The Legion who died here.
GID00094643	Even if you were Legion, you would answer for those deaths by Caesar's law.
GID00094644	As I said before... it's of no consequence. Never intended you to find them, never intended you to hear them.
GID00094645	Questions in those tapes I still haven't found answers to. You won't be the one to give them.
GID00094646	Should've died there... but now that I know you live... the machines here... saved me. I was the only survivor, or thought I was.
GID00094647	Your package, the message inside, awoke medical machines... close to the one that shadows you... began to build themselves, then others.
GID00094648	They only take what parts they find in the Divide, never roam beyond it - can't even leave the silos without a human to shadow, like hounds.
GID00094649	Maybe they saw the flag on my jacket, thought I was of America. If so, history saved me. A sign.
GID00094650	At the end of the Divide, through the trenches and wreckage - that's where you'll find me. My new home, here, amongst dead men.
GID00094651	You and that machine, keep your eyes on the tower that cuts the horizon... you'll find your way. Made it this far... not much farther to go.
GID00094652	You delivered a package. Had markings that matched those in the Divide. Not all... but enough.
GID00094653	Military markings, from some place the Bear had savaged in the West. Maybe seeing those markings on it reminded you of home... made you carry it.
GID00094654	An ending. To this road, you and I. First, you need to find your way. At the end, I'll be waiting.
GID00094655	These new inhabitants... not natives... most of them. Came with duty, purpose... ready to kill each other. The Divide was stronger.
GID00094656	Left marks on them, too. Not Bear, not Bull - now... radiation's marked them, made them equal in history's eyes.
GID00094657	As vicious as the storms are, these shadows of Legion, of NCR - silhouettes of things to come.
GID00094658	Might have been. Once. To the Divide they came... in the Divide, they rest.
GID00094659	Might have been. Once. To the Divide they came... in the Divide, they rest.
GID00094660	Meant to? No. Never. Your burden.
GID00094661	Weigh you down long enough to let death catch up to you... but you survived.
GID00094662	There was death in that package, and while the Chip is important to Old World ghosts... no, you are more dangerous than that Chip ever could be.
GID00094663	Maybe why you found each other, little piece of the Old World, speaking to you, waiting for you to wake something else up with it.
GID00094664	We all have death following us, only a question of how close. You dodged it - for a time. You're good at that, talent for it.
GID00094665	With that Chip weighing you down... a burden, lets death move a little faster without me pulling the trigger.
GID00094666	Promises to keep. To others. And the Mojave's dangerous enough - left to the land, the land has its way.
GID00094667	If I wanted you dead, we would have met sooner. Not sure that's the way this ends.
GID00094668	Might be that history needs to have its say. If not, then messages will do.
GID00094669	Even as the fires here burned them from within... the winds of the Divide tore their skin, exposed them... screaming... to the sky.
GID00094670	And just as the Divide tears at them, so they tear at each other, for sport - like some tribal scarification. Falling back to their history, maybe.
GID00094671	No matter what they suffer... the radiation, fire of the Divide, sustains them. Makes them stronger.
GID00094672	[SUCCEEDED] There's truth in your words, in what I've seen of their tactics, movements - recovery. Those wounds - they couldn't live otherwise.
GID00094673	The Divide winds have torn the skin from many of them - may be the radiation is the only thing keeping them walking.
GID00094674	Make camp near silos... warheads. No way to cleanse the radiation - makes them hard to kill there, have to draw them out.
GID00094675	[FAILED] They're more beasts than men now. They clutch at their pain as they clutch at their weapons... anchors them.
GID00094676	[SUCCEEDED] There's truth in your words, in what I've seen of their tactics, movements - recovery. Those wounds - they couldn't live otherwise.
GID00094677	The Divide winds have torn the skin from many of them - may be the radiation is the only thing keeping them walking.

GID00094679	[FAILED] They're more beasts than men now. They clutch at their pain as they clutch at their weapons... anchors them.
GID00094680	[SUCCEEDED] America sleeps in the Divide - giants, beneath the earth. You saw one locked in the silo beneath you. There's more.
GID00094681	Only takes a few of them, locked below ground, to tear apart the earth... and cast dust, sand... ash... into the skies above.
GID00094682	You'll see the extent - the miles of it, soon enough. You need to see it... walk it.
GID00094683	[FAILED] Wasn't always like this. Old World wreckage's nothing new... after that, something you had your hand in - you'll walk it soon enough.
GID00094684	For the two-headed Bear... NCR... they don't have symbols in the same way Legion does.
GID00094685	They revere their mines and explosives, guns... that is their religion - death from afar, take pride in it.
GID00094686	Not my given name, close enough.
GID00094687	Took it from history, found it in a book. It's an Old World name.
GID00094688	Ulysses lived a long time ago, long before the Old World set fire to itself. He made a mark without being myth.
GID00094689	Had to fight during a time when his world had two flags, and he had to make them one.
GID00094690	[SUCCEEDED] History. Yes.
GID00094691	Ulysses walked a hard road. A general, like Caesar and Oliver. He was Brahmin-stubborn, gave him strength on the battlefield.
GID00094692	He led his side to victory, turned two flags into one. That's when he lost - when the fighting was done, the sickness took hold.
GID00094693	Lesson there, if history's to be believed. One you should heed.
GID00094694	[FAILED] Search history, might find meaning in it.
GID00094695	It's just a name - you have no idea who I am. You'll know by the end.
GID00094696	[SUCCEEDED] War. Call it that. Our part in it.
GID00094697	Ulysses wasn't made for the flag he followed. He wasn't made for peace. That's the lesson.
GID00094698	If you follow a symbol to the end, ask yourself what that means. More important, ask what happens after the end.
GID00094699	[FAILED] Fighting? Yes... but different weapons than you're used to.
GID00094700	You're wasting time. Stalling. Won't help you.
GID00094701	What kind of world would this be if Courier killed Courier.
GID00094702	You've got enough distance ahead of you - save your breath for the road, don't waste it on words.
GID00094703	All right... Courier. If the why of it matters to you.
GID00094704	I hold Legion to be my brothers... even as misguided as they are. And you... more so than most.
GID00094705	It's not Legion - the Legion I know, but they change, even in small ways as they march West, with every tribe they break.
GID00094706	But yes... last I heard, you needed a weapon between your legs to carry one for Caesar.
GID00094707	What do you m... I see the way of it. Have fight in you, at least. Save it for the road ahead.
GID00094708	Power isn't strength. Power can wall off someone, when they believe it's freed them.
GID00094709	House's power... you've seen the wall around Vegas. He gains more power, that wall will grow. The Mojave'll become Vegas.
GID00094710	But it's more lights than strength. You'll see the way of it soon enough.
GID00094711	No... not new. And not new among all those in the shadow of the Bear.
GID00094712	You know their flag, a bear with two heads. Symbol's an Old World one, had one head then, better off for it.
GID00094713	Their flag speaks to their spirit. They're split like any two-headed animal, trying to go in different directions, ending up nowhere.
GID00094714	In the Mojave, that'll only get you sand between your fingers - or over your grave.
GID00094715	Yes. And any Courier could tell you the same, see it everywhere. The Bear...
GID00094716	...Bear's too busy carving up the Mojave with knives, roads, borders, and how things should be to see how it is.
GID00094717	They're stretched thin, can't protect their frontlines, their towns, think paper's power, radio means control - all of it, useless.
GID00094718	Trying doesn't hold much weight with me. Legion doesn't try to kill people, they do it. The Bear kills people trying to protect them.
GID00094719	Irony's sharp. And Legion... their flag may be old, but it's not at war with itself.
GID00094720	No matter now. Bear couldn't hold the Divide.
GID00094721	You and that machine, are all that remains of NCR here... rest fell to radiation, fire... and what burrows below.
GID00094722	Maybe that's why you chose Vegas... the lights can blind, make people forget themselves. Their convictions - vows.
GID00094723	Not going to waste time trying to make the blind see. Took a chance coming here - same as I did. Now we'll see how it plays out.
GID00094725	Not going to convince a deaf man with words. Shown strength coming in here - if strength's what you respect, then you belong East of the Colorado.
GID00094726	Your future with House has two roads. The road the tribals in Vegas walked... their spirits crushed...
GID00094727	...or your face on a robot servant, smiling forever in a dead casino. There's future in neither.
GID00094728	Vegas is Old World, filled with Old World ghosts. And ghosts need the living to do their work.
GID00094729	That's why the families are there, why the Bear stumbles there to lose itself. It's a dance, I don't know its purpose.
GID00094730	You've been, you've seen the Wall. It's what's inside that worries me.
GID00094731	That's the wrong word. "Theater" is better - the families, the Bear all on a stage.
GID00094732	House. He's the one watching. The why... you'd know better than I would. If you don't - you will.
GID00094733	You've been, you've seen the Wall. Safe? No... what's inside - that's what worries me.
GID00094734	Inside, Old World's waking up. No facts or history I've heard tells me that city ever went to sleep, and that makes me think.
GID00094735	The blue of the Mojave skies - isn't like the rest of the world. Don't hear a Geiger ticking there, more to fear from predators than rads.
GID00094736	The city - the whole Mojave, wasn't hit by bombs. Been my call, Vegas would be one of the first pieces of the Old World to burn.
GID00094737	Someone protected it. Wasn't chance, wasn't luck. Something larger - yet they let the rest of the world suffer. And they'll do it again.
GID00094738	Families of Vegas were once tribes. Got drunk on the Vegas lights, the spirit bled out of them. Old World history, under a different flag.
GID00094739	Whatever traditions or rituals they had, most likely squeezed out of them by now, turned into something else.
GID00094740	And if not, then I'm afraid what's going to happen when they come creeping back.
GID00094741	Believe that. Vegas runs, I've seen what it's done to those who oppose it. And I've seen its messengers.
GID00094742	No... only seen his works. Those he's broken with light and gold. His messengers.
GID00094743	But everything in Vegas speaks of someone who can't let go.
GID00094744	House takes a shovel to history's graves, props up the dead, then puts words in their mouths. The tribes don't even know how they were broken.
GID00094745	Not a world I want to be part of, going through motions until we're all smiling faces on some robot's screen.
GID00094746	The High Road... not the Divide yet, many more miles to walk. But you got this far. You and that machine that shadows you.
GID00094747	Wasn't sure if both of you'd make it - above, then below the underpass.
GID00094748	[SUCCEEDED] "Who are you, who do not know your history?"
GID00094749	You came all this way for answers. Only currency I have, nothing else to be gained - could turn around, walk away at any time.
GID00094750	If history matters to you... you'll need to earn it. Any logs of mine I have already cast away in the Divide, they're lost to you.
GID00094751	[FAILED] You want to know more, keep walking.
GID00094752	I'll give answers as you go. Not before.
GID00094753	Mojave and the Divide aren't the only places I've walked.
GID00094754	[SUCCEEDED] Mojave and the Divide aren't the only places I've walked.
GID00094755	[FAILED] Another city fallen to nations, in the east... not important. Doubt you'll ever walk that far, you'd need the land to sustain you.
GID00094756	[SUCCEEDED] Makes sense. Truth favors that, matches the history of this place.
GID00094757	Were signs they were here for a long time, before Marked Men, before what happened to the Divide cracked their sky.
GID00094758	If so, they were buried deep. Might have been born the day America's embers started to settle. Seen worse things twisted by radiation.
GID00094759	[FAILED] Don't know the history of them - only their patterns, how they hunt.
GID00094760	Still, takes a long time for such patterns to develop. A longer history than what happened here.
GID00094761	Home isn't where you're born into this world. You taught me that. Part of your message, whether you meant it or not.
GID00094762	Can be a place of mind, a moment where you know who you are, the history of it. And they can be places you breathe life into.
GID00094763	Never would have known the Divide had it not been for you. The road you made with your tracks, again and again.
GID00094764	You were the only one willing to make the journey to and from here... a hard road. Kept the land before the Divide alive through seasons, storms...
GID00094765	...can't have been just a job. Was something more to you. Don't feel for a place that hard unless it's home.
GID00094766	Want to hear the answer of it. Not just history's answer... your answer for what happened here.
GID00094767	It means everything - even if you deny it, cast it aside, that speaks to what you are, proves what happened here.
GID00094768	And you've forgotten. Forgotten everything. Careless, as careless with futures then as you are now in the Mojave.
GID00094769	Wrong? No, I know the truth of it.
GID00094770	It was you walking that road that kept the Divide alive. It grew from what you did. Settlers... camps... filling that Old World city.
GID00094771	Chance for a new nation, new beginning. New way of thinking.
GID00094772	Could've breathed new life into the Mojave, bridging East, West. Like Hoover Dam... but not Old World, something you made. Road was a supply line.
GID00094773	No, recounting history.
GID00094774	Not any more. If one existed, the two-headed Bear would have claimed it. And it tried to.
GID00094775	NCR saw the worth in that road you made. Staked a claim, whether it was wanted there or not - true elsewhere in the Mojave.
GID00094776	And where the Bear tries to cling to life, the Legion comes... bearing messages. Some brought by blade. Others... by Couriers.
GID00094777	You knew what was coming, as sure as I know what's coming for you.
GID00094778	This time you carry the burden. Walk west into the sun, and keep walking until it dies. There - I'll be waiting.
GID00094779	Mojave and the Divide aren't the only places I've walked.
GID00094780	It was a device, a detonator. One I'd never seen before - or heard before.
GID00094781	You carried that thing to the Divide. I know because I followed you as you walked the road, watched you do it.
GID00094782	You brought it here, to the community you built. And you are responsible for what happened after - when the device opened, started to speak.
GID00094783	When it did, the Divide answered back. Those missiles you've seen, buried in their silos.
GID00094784	They exploded beneath the ground, cracked the landscape. Sand, ash... the dead... the Divide skies became a graveyard.
GID00094785	It was from the West. From deep in NCR. Whether made by them or not... it came here. Through your hands.
GID00094786	All these roads, you walked. These packages you carried. Think it wasn't your choice?
GID00094787	Of course it was your choice. You could have stayed in the Mojave. But you chose to come, couldn't let be - not in you to let go.
GID00094788	Came for no other reason than you were curious, restless - always have been. Had to know the why of it - now, I'll show you.
GID00094789	If you had been there when it happened. If you had seen the Divide break, you would know it.
GID00094790	You carry death wherever you go - if the Mojave doesn't know it yet, it will.
GID00094791	No... I'm certain. What I hadn't known was that you still lived after the Divide.
GID00094792	You will. I'll show the Mojave, Bear and Bull the way of it. How Couriers can break nations.
GID00094793	What happened here... can happen again. You've already proved it, what you did in Ashton. The silo there.
GID00094794	Didn't stop you, though. Like carrying the Chip to Vegas, Old World death in your hand.
GID00094795	Pieces of the Old World like that just need someone careless enough to take them where they need to go, to do their killing.
GID00094796	No, you are. Cut off your retreat, your supply line. Ashton missile, turned Hopeville into a furnace.
GID00094797	You could walk back. Still can - but the Divide will mark you, sickness will set in.
GID00094798	Not immediate, maybe, but in time. Slow burn, a little faster than before.
GID00094799	The way ahead and below - leads to the heart of the Divide.
GID00094800	And there... you and I, we'll have an ending to things.
GID00094801	Spent years looking for you. If you head back to the Mojave, it's like nothing's changed. Can live with that. Had to.
GID00094802	Wasn't sure if history would matter to you. If it doesn't, that answers my question.
GID00094803	If you turn your back on your home, so be it. I'll remain here in the Divide for you to return. And you will.
GID00094804	Your road's not done. Haven't walked it full yet, not nearly enough.
GID00094805	The two-headed Bear made its claim, dug its claws into the trail you made. For once, it seemed like it might succeed - cut a route to the Mojave.
GID00094806	Couldn't let NCR stay in the Divide. Trade route, road the military could use... can't have two roads into the Mojave.
GID00094807	Not after the work we'd done to cut off New Canaan, other routes, killing caravans... all we'd done to make the West bleed.
GID00094808	Already heard you once, long ago and loud enough for history to hear. Tired of your messages.
GID00094809	Still - curiosity drove you this far. Let's see what else it can do.
GID00094810	Caesar's orders. Every supply line gets cut, every community that feeds the Bear... cut its throat, starve the Mojave.
GID00094811	Assassin? If killing needs to be done, I'll face my victims... not kill from a distance, like you.
GID00094812	No, when they come this far, they aren't Legion. They walk as Couriers. Like we do.
GID00094813	And the Divide is the reason no Legion has been seen. None belong to Caesar. Not in this place.
GID00094814	The ones that came... were following orders.
GID00094815	Bear made its shadow felt here, more than I could handle. Heavy guard, watchful. I watched, waited.
GID00094816	And as I watched, studied the people. The flag, markings. Thought perhaps... if I got rid of the Bear... what you had given life to might come again.
GID00094817	Waited too long. Hesitated. A Courier isn't meant to stay in one place for long. And then you came, with the package. History.
GID00094818	All right. Done with words, then, won't get you where you need to go.
GID00094819	No, they don't know the history of it. So send others to find out, more to die... at the hands of their brothers the Divide has claimed.
GID00094820	It doesn't matter, the Bear's reach was cut off. Now only the Long 15 remains. Once that's finished, Mojave will be under the flag of the Bull.
GID00094821	Didn't know, but Couriers can travel anywhere. They make roads into places no one else will go, guarded or not. Was going to watch, see.
GID00094822	The Legion... thought it might get into the community through me, just as I'd found the way by following you.
GID00094823	But you struck first, shattered the ground, and let your home burn instead. Nearly killed me. And everyone here, walking or still.
GID00094824	The tapes... didn't think those would be found... weren't worth the words anyway, not like I'd forget what happened.
GID00094825	Had the tech from the Big Empty, recorder a woman gave me... on its last legs, didn't survive the road. Cast it and the tapes aside.
GID00094826	If you heard them... they're of no consequence. Ramblings, reminders for a man who doesn't need them.
GID00094827	[SUCCEEDED] Maybe not. Who's to say.
GID00094828	You, perhaps. Found them, heard them after I cast them aside - maybe there was purpose in that.
GID00094829	If they matter... if history matters... we'll see at the end of the road.
GID00094830	[FAILED] Words lost to history. Wouldn't have left them on the road otherwise.
GID00094831	Twisted Hairs are dead, lost at Dry Wells, died in Vulpes' smile. Won't discuss their fate with you, not now - their past is mine to keep.
GID00094832	Walk farther, see me face to face - you might earn more. Now, let the words keep you without me adding to them.
GID00094833	I had, did. It was madness... asked them a question in anger. Got an answer, more than I expected.
GID00094834	Answer told me what happened here at the Divide, the how of it, and that was enough.
GID00094835	The tape has the telling of it, don't need me adding to the questions already there.
GID00094836	The tapes... didn't think those would be found... you know the Divide better than I thought.
GID00094837	Had tech from the Big Empty, recorder a woman gave me... didn't survive the road, on its last legs.
GID00094838	Cast it and the tapes aside... weren't worth the words anyway, not like I'd forget what happened.
GID00094839	If you heard them... nothing but ramblings, reminders for a man who doesn't need them. Probably more, lying from here to the Divide.
GID00094840	You know the why of it. If you don't - I do, and that's enough. Shows trust only walks so far West.
GID00094841	Earned more than that, though, getting this far. We walk the same road, carry the same colors. Can't break that by making the road red.
GID00094842	Want more than that, walk the Divide. Answers'll come, closer you get to home... you and that machine.
GID00094843	You scavenge words. Things I have no need of, no history there worth recounting.
GID00094844	Scour the Divide, claw at it for meaning - but my words will give you no answer.
GID00094845	[SUCCEEDED] They won't help you understand what happened here.
GID00094846	And they won't help you understand me. Keep them, listen, study them - they won't help you here in the Divide.
GID00094847	[FAILED] Words lost to history. Wouldn't have left them on the road otherwise.
GID00094848	Won't hold it. Divide taught me you don't need to - just cut it off.
GID00094849	Then the Mojave will fall, Bear will starve, its flag will burn. It's spent too long dying, the Long 15 will end it.
GID00094850	The tapes... didn't think those would be found... weren't worth the words anyway, not like I'd forget what happened.
GID00094851	Had the tech from the Big Empty, recorder a woman gave me... on its last legs, didn't survive the road. Cast it and the tapes aside.
GID00094852	If you heard them... they're of no consequence. Ramblings, reminders for a man who doesn't need them.
GID00094853	You scavenge words. Things I have no need of, no history there worth recounting.
GID00094854	Scour the Divide, claw at it for meaning - but my words will give you no answer.
GID00094855	[SUCCEEDED] Maybe not. Who's to say.
GID00094856	You, perhaps. Found them, heard them after I cast them aside - maybe there was purpose in that.
GID00094857	If they matter... if history matters... we'll see at the end of the road.
GID00094858	[FAILED] Words lost to history. Wouldn't have left them on the road otherwise.
GID00094859	[SUCCEEDED] They won't help you understand what happened here.
GID00094860	And they won't help you understand me. Keep them, listen, study them - they won't help you here in the Divide.
GID00094861	[FAILED] Words lost to history. Wouldn't have left them on the road otherwise.
GID00094862	You've seen the Divide, walked it - farther than I thought you would. Not sure how much farther you have in you.
GID00094863	If you need answers, speak. You've earned them... even if only you and I can carry them from here.
GID00094864	If I have the answers, you've earned them.
GID00094865	You know what it was. Had the symbols of America on it. New markings. From after the Great War.
GID00094866	Thought it might be America come again. Promise of another future. Another flag.
GID00094867	I knew of you, your name. Your road, to and from the Divide, what that meant for the Legion.
GID00094868	We never spoke, knew you through your actions. Knew you'd walked the West as I'd walked the East. Learned different lessons.
GID00094869	And I would never have discovered the Divide without you.
GID00094870	Promises to keep. 'Courier shall not kill Courier.' Always - let them live, spread the word.
GID00094871	Caesar's orders. Some time before I realized the why of it. Wasn't just you. All couriers.
GID00094872	No telling how many were Legion. Maybe all of them.
GID00094873	Wasn't sure about you. Until the Divide... all the NCR burning... that much death, it bears the mark of a Legion hand.
GID00094874	But you killed like NCR. Like Hanlon, with mines, bombs... missiles. Killed Legion along with the Bear. Like a coward, kills from a distance.
GID00094875	If you were Legion, then NCR beat you, the West changed you.
GID00094876	Promises to keep. 'Courier shall not kill Courier.' Always - let them live, spread the word.
GID00094877	It was a piece of machinery... military, holding memories, codes, maybe. When it woke, made these sounds... words.
GID00094878	When it spoke, the Divide became fire, the ground... tore apart like the skies. Through it all, kept calling out - maybe calling for home.
GID00094879	[SUCCEEDED] Hate? No. There's nothing to hate in metal... steel, gold. Or platinum.
GID00094880	Your machine... it's just a tool, made of wreckage of the Divide... all that was brought here.
GID00094881	[FAILED] When I speak in anger, Courier, you'll know it. Your machine? Worth no more hate than any other machine.
GID00094882	Machine couldn't speak by itself. Needed a terminal to access it... like the terminals in the silos here, or the machine with you.
GID00094883	When it was connected, it started speaking. And the Divide answered.
GID00094884	The Dam. That Old World Wall.
GID00094885	The Dam. That Old World Wall.
GID00094886	The Dam. That Old World Wall.
GID00094887	The why of it. Hoover Dam.
GID00094888	The Bear, NCR, couldn't be allowed to reach it easily. Long 15... Canaan... both bad enough.
GID00094889	Kimball, Caesar, House... you'd think their whole world was that wall, cutting the Colorado. If I'd never laid eyes on it, never spoke of it...
GID00094890	...but once found, it was all Caesar could see. That, and the flag beyond it, another symbol, big enough to challenge him.
GID00094891	And the Divide, one of the roads to it - Legion was tasked with cutting that artery. If you can't kill the Bear in one stroke, bleed it, starve it.
GID00094892	That kind of murder... it's what any of the Legion would have done. Now... the Divide belongs to history.
GID00094893	Blame? Accident? The names you hang on this... Courier... you carry death wherever you go, Mojave knows - or will.
GID00094894	I'll see you answer for this. The road doesn't end here, there's more to come, I swear to you.
GID00094895	Accident? Ignorance is a choice. The Chip - a choice.
GID00094896	As for anger... it is what I carry for the dead, and all that come here.
GID00094897	Not the name I'd give it. Not the name the dead would give it.
GID00094898	Soldiers of the Bear died here... Legion died, too, my brothers. Still dying, both of them, all around us.
GID00094899	None of the people that lived here survived... yet all of the West and the East, they hold on as the Divide tears at them.
GID00094900	Revenge isn't the message I have for you. More than that... Courier.
GID00094901	Machinery. Simple on the outside, computer parts. Inside... more complicated.
GID00094902	Was the only time I'd heard a machine speak in the Divide, the only machine with a voice.
GID00094903	I've walked the East. You've walked the West, more than I have.
GID00094904	Circle Junction. Reno. Vault City. Word of you at Fort Aradesh... Fort Abandon. Even further West than that, Brahmin drives on the Big Circle.
GID00094905	Whatever you saw out there, wasn't enough to make you stay. Maybe the markings on the package reminded you of the road home.
GID00094906	Buried in the Divide. Part of it now.
GID00094907	Wherever it is, it's been silent... if it spoke again, we'd know.
GID00094908	I know that now. Doesn't change what was done. The Legion who died here.
GID00094909	Legion doesn't know your history. I do. They find out what happened here, how many of their own died... they'll want an answer.
GID00094910	Then Legion kills Legion. Farther you walk from the flag of the Bull, the more West creeps into you.
GID00094911	Legion wears many colors, East and West. You... maybe blinded by Vegas's light, or the promise of that Chip.
GID00094912	Or maybe you walked so far West, the Bear's sickness crept into you. We'll see. Your offenses before Caesar, the least of the crimes here.
GID00094913	Really. Who's to say the truth of it. You? No. You walked from this, turned your back on it. Now you and others will answer for it.
GID00094914	I'll start with the West. Let that burn. Then... if the East falters after, I'll bring the Divide there as well.
GID00094915	Burn away the flags. Begin again.
GID00094916	It's a messenger. Like us... and it shares our history.
GID00094917	If you feel its loss... remember you could have turned away at any time. Gone back home, and none of this would have happened.
GID00094918	But you had to make one last delivery, and that's why I knew you'd come, Courier. Couldn't stay away, it's who you are.
GID00094919	What's inside that machine - that's all that mattered. All the machines here, made of wreckage from the Divide... and all that was brought here.
GID00094920	Inside its frame, it carries the message you brought here... and it'll do what it was programmed to do: whatever it can to get home.
GID00094921	The giants here will listen to it. I'll bring the Divide to your home, your nation. Let its flag burn, just like you let the Divide burn.
GID00094922	Big Mountain access code... Ulysses. Command override...
GID00094923	Navarro.
GID00094924	Many in the Mojave think the Divide's nothing but canyon and storm. Wasn't always.
GID00094925	There was life, a town, farther West... not talking about an Old World town like Hopeville... more recent. Something you saw in your lifetime.
GID00094926	It had the name "the Divide," too. But rather than cracks in the earth, it was a road from the West into the Mojave, a supply line.
GID00094927	Took a Courier to make that road. You. Back then, you saw the road with eyes facing East. This time... the Divide's in the other direction.
GID00094928	And if your eyes try to make sense of it when you reach it... home's not what it was.
GID00094929	All roads lead back to one's home. Not your birthplace maybe, but home.
GID00094930	You gave it a name. What was it to you? Companion? Slave... weapon? All of that, nothing compared to its primary function.
GID00094931	The machine you brought is mine now, it's coming home. I'll reduce it to parts, just enough to function, to be aware of what's happening.
GID00094932	My family? My tribe lives... its history? Died long ago, fell under the shadow of the Bull... consumed by another symbol.
GID00094933	No, this isn't about family - or any common blood. It's blood shared by acts, not by chance.
GID00094934	The soldiers of the Bear? They were dead already, their symbol... diseased. Deserved to die as my brothers did at Boulder City, mines, bombs.
GID00094935	I carry nothing for them. Their deaths here were a mercy - compared to the ones that still walk the Divide.
GID00094936	As for my brothers in the Legion... they deserved to die in battle, as do all beneath the flag of the Bull.
GID00094937	But no... the dead number more than my brothers.
GID00094938	The soldiers of the Bear? They were dead already, their symbol... diseased. Deserved to die as my brothers did at Boulder City, mines, bombs.
GID00094939	I carry nothing for them. Their deaths here were a mercy - compared to the ones that still walk the Divide.
GID00094940	The Legion who died here... they didn't deserve to die, like those that died in the fires of Boulder City... bombs, Hanlon's gifts.
GID00094941	Their deaths were mercy compared to those who still walk. Any who die beneath the flag of the Bull... their death should be in battle.
GID00094942	But no... the dead number more than my brothers.
GID00094943	The supply line - the artery for the West? I have seen the blood of NCR at Legion hands many times.
GID00094944	I carry no hatred for duty... if that's what this was. The Divide was more than that. Its people, more than that.
GID00094945	Serves the Legion?
GID00094946	I carry no hatred for duty... if that's what this was. The Divide was more than that. Its people, more than that.
GID00094947	The community that was once here... and the package you brought... both had markings of the Divide. Markings of America.
GID00094948	You've seen the marks, the symbol. As early as the Hopeville silo, maybe. Carried it etched on your weapons.
GID00094949	The Divide, its buildings, its people, were built around those same markings, surrounded them here...
GID00094950	...markings like the flag on my back. When I followed your road to the Divide those years ago, I saw the symbol I wore all around me.
GID00094951	An Old World symbol. Strong, to survive here - its people, strong. Outlast the Bear, outlast the Bull. Promise of something better.
GID00094952	Caesar was right to want it dead. NCR was right to want to rake their claws in it.
GID00094953	Seeing it... changed me, just as seeing Hoover Dam changed Caesar and the NCR.
GID00094954	Seeing it end changed me, too.
GID00094955	There was hope here, another chance. A new nation, stirring to life. A place I could have set my flag.
GID00094956	Not the America of old. But something larger than the tribes of the East, something larger than the houses of the West. Something better.
GID00094957	The Divide... could have bridged both, like Hoover Dam. Now like the Dam, it's too covered in blood to see what it could have been.
GID00094958	You gave life to this place. I followed your road here, saw the Divide. You led me here, so that I could see.
GID00094959	Then, you brought it to an end.
GID00094960	My history isn't revenge, or hate. The road that brought us both here - isn't about that.
GID00094961	It's about the message you carried. The one in that package, whether you knew it or not.
GID00094962	The message that one can kill a nation. Can kill a symbol. And all that gather beneath its flag.
GID00094963	I don't blame you for the Divide. I blame you for what you made me see.
GID00094964	Now you will see what you brought to the Mojave, and that will be my message to you.
GID00094965	The nations of the Mojave. Cracked and broken as the Divide... its people, the same.
GID00094966	I have walked at Caesar's command, across the East, into the West. Far enough to know Caesar's word did not drive me. Far enough to see the end.
GID00094967	You've seen it. No Courier, whatever their flag can ignore it. Why you didn't stay in the West. Why you wandered.
GID00094968	There is no future in the Bear or Bull. The Bear is diseased, barely clings to life.
GID00094969	And the Bull... when the Legion reaches the sea, it will turn on itself and die.
GID00094970	Killing one will end both. And you made me see how one could do it. Your ignorance, carelessness - can be used with a purpose.
GID00094971	You already tried once, won't give you another chance.
GID00094972	Machines... bombs, things of NCR, are your tools, not mine. When we meet, this machine won't keep me from you.
GID00094973	What kind of world would this be if Courier killed Courier.
GID00094974	You've got enough distance ahead of you - save your breath for the road, don't waste it on words.
GID00094975	You struck first. Not just at me... at the Legion. Or so I thought. Not sure of the history of it now.
GID00094976	Whatever flag you follow, or followed then... either way, you got too much of the Bear's sickness in you to live. Divide's proof of that.
GID00094977	Want more than that, walk the road. Answers'll come, closer you get to home... you and that machine.
GID00094978	Legion died here as well. What you did... that's not all that cuts at me.
GID00094979	Accident? Ignorance is a choice. The Chip - a choice.
GID00094980	As for anger... it is what I carry for the dead, and all that come here.
GID00094981	Yes. And it did to you once, I'm sure of it.
GID00094982	No, it is a title you earned. Legion or not, you have betrayed more than you know.
GID00094983	If that's all that drives you, it won't last. The Legion... it won't last either.
GID00094984	I'll finish history's work. If the Divide couldn't kill you... perhaps these spears of the Old World can.
GID00094985	Let's end this, Courier, you and I. Here, with the Old World flag as witness.
GID00094986	You've answered your own question. And you'll die with that question on your lips.
GID00094987	That's part of why I'm here. Watch them - if they attack me, try to enter the Mojave, I answer. Not looking to kill them... save them, if I can.
GID00094988	There might be something saving in them. If not, then what I do is mercy, not murder.
GID00094990	Old World wall, run red with blood of Bear and Bull. It'll bleed more before the sun sets on the Mojave.
GID00094991	That place and I have a past, owe it a debt - and it owes me. If your path takes you there, know you're not the only one.
GID00094992	It's the wall by which this age will be measured, the gravestone of the Mojave. Old World never meant it as such.
GID00094993	My words? And what do my words teach you.
GID00094994	That question... either you walked the Big Empty... you found the last of the holotapes.
GID00094995	The words are mine. Whatever... "answer" you think they hold, you're wrong. It was a question, nothing more.
GID00094996	The invisible fires burn here, true enough. Still... to have helped carry out such an act, then not face it...
GID00094997	Not my way. If my life burns out here, so be it... until then, I wait and watch, see what the road brings.
GID00094998	Questions have a habit of making others.
GID00094999	My name for it. If you have a better one, you grant it - my choice in names won't carry past you and I.
GID00095000	Lies along the road, running from the Hopeville silo... straight on to where the ground burns, and wind howls even stronger than here.
GID00095001	I believed in what I followed then. Kill no Courier, Caesar's words. I honored them.
GID00095002	Other Couriers could have been Legion - like me. Now, our allegiances are reversed.
GID00095003	Not if you believe in what you follow. Kill no Courier, Caesar's words. I honored them.
GID00095004	Other Couriers could have been Legion - like me. The truth is, you serve nothing, believe nothing. Killing you... meaningless.
GID00095005	[SUCCEEDED] The why of it... you taught me the why of it.
GID00095006	If you believe in something enough, you must be willing to let it burn, lest it claim you.
GID00095007	These governments of the two-headed bear... the Legion... they carry Old World ideas into an age that no longer needs them, where they cannot live.
GID00095008	[FAILED] Yes, that is what you proved to me at the Divide - what is here, what you showed me... it is enough.
GID00095009	You don't understand. You will.
GID00095010	Comes down to perspective, how far one's walked, and what they've left behind.
GID00095011	If you challenge this moment, let's hear your perspective. If my words are all you have, let's hear them.
GID00095012	It may be... that as much destruction has been written in the earth here...
GID00095013	One buried this place, yet it lived on between us. One may build it again - build others. Your history has proven this, here.
GID00095014	There is truth in your words. But even if there is hope in change... it may not matter. The Divide still stands against us.
GID00095015	[SUCCEEDED] Our history... the Divide. That history has been written, its lessons learned.
GID00095016	There is nothing more to be dug from these cracks in the earth, no more fury to be torn from its sky.
GID00095017	[FAILED] If those are your last words, they are weak ones. Actions would have had more voice.
GID00095018	There is nothing more to be said between us. No words of yours will change what is about to happen.
GID00095019	Even after the road you've walked, you only see a traitor before you.
GID00095020	Not all the East will burn. The Legion does not need to be destroyed, only... contained within new borders.
GID00095021	After that, it will fall as any culture bred on war, on forward momentum. It will falter, collapse.
GID00095022	I will start with their camp at Dry Wells... once my homeland. Justice of a sort.
GID00095023	I cannot go back. I wandered too far, far enough to know my home was lost to me.
GID00095024	I could no more go back than you could return to the West. To NCR, and all its sickness.
GID00095025	I'll finish history's work. If the Divide couldn't kill you... perhaps these spears of the Old World can.
GID00095026	Let's end this, Courier, you and I. Here, with the Old World flag as witness.
GID00095027	History? Cures a wound, leaves the bitterness that caused it. The Twin Mothers were always about lessons.
GID00095028	Caesar taught them the last one, though, so that's it for them. Recipe still exists, Legion uses it on forced marches with wounded soldiers.
GID00095029	Wouldn't have made it through Crimson River Trail a few years back without it - losing so much blood early on, was a Cazador feast.
GID00095030	Enough Xander root and Broc flower along the trail though, the Legion was able to keep pace and get where they were going.
GID00095031	Can do that and one better... just enough around to mix some. Here - might make the Twin Mothers' history live a little longer, you carrying it.
GID00095032	When you drink it, down it all in one shot, or your stomach's not going to want to keep going after the second drink.
GID00095033	Too soon to tell what will happen, let history weigh what you've done, if it gets that far.
GID00095034	Unless you do the same for the Legate that comes, you'll get no thanks from me. When that Monster arrives, he's not going to have a leash.
GID00095035	Caesar could command him. Not now. The Bear's going to burn, and burn slow.
GID00095036	He let another hold a knife to him. If he was weak enough to allow the knife so close to his neck, maybe it needed to be his ending.
GID00095037	Caesar would be history's hypocrite if he was angry about what happened. I'm not one for it, either.
GID00095038	Seems you just proved his philosophy to him. If he'd been stronger, he'd be alive, and we wouldn't be talking.
GID00095039	Done with blame, and Caesar was big on strength making right. Seems to me you proved that philosophy to him.
GID00095040	If he was too weak to stop you, too weak to defend himself, then he needed to die with his beliefs.
GID00095041	Wasn't his time, and wouldn't have been how he wanted to die.
GID00095042	Not how most would've wanted him to die, either, Bear or Bull.
GID00095043	What you did was for the best. The Old World died long ago. Anyone who believes they can make it return and everything will be as it was...
GID00095044	...it is a dangerous belief. Needs to be silenced before their belief spreads.
GID00095045	If you saw House, you didn't see a man. An Old World spirit, perhaps - filthy, diseased. If so, killing him was mercy, not cruelty.
GID00095046	Let House sleep in his chamber. Let him dream of the Old World he remembers, and keep those memories where they belong, in his head.
GID00095047	Bear and Bull shed too much blood there to let it go. Can't stop you from going, wouldn't.
GID00095048	A warning, though - the Legate, Lanius. Whether Caesar stands or not, Lanius will come.
GID00095049	Lanius... the "Butcher." Monster, Terror of the East.
GID00095050	Not even his slaves have seen his face - struck them blind so they can't. Wears a mask, don't even know if it's the same man.
GID00095051	He put Colorado to the sword, broke the Hangdogs by throwing their hounds upon the flames, so they might burn forever in the afterlife.
GID00095052	Then there is nothing more to be done. The Mojave awaits.
GID00095053	The Divide belongs to history now. The Mojave awaits.
GID00095054	The Divide belongs to history now. The Mojave awaits.
GID00095055	Lanius carries all the terrors of the East with him. He's the myth, the weapon the Legion needs.
GID00095056	When he arrives, he'll fall on Hoover Dam like a hammer, break the Bear in two.
GID00095057	To take Hoover Dam, Legion will need something as big as the Old World itself - another symbol, forged by history.
GID00095058	Nineteen tribes could not do it. All the lights in Vegas cannot.
GID00095059	His strength lies in his title - and it is his weakness. He will not fight a losing battle and destroy what he represents.
GID00095060	Put the idea of loss in him. Convince him the Bear will not be the twentieth tribe beneath his heel, it will make him pause like nothing on earth.
GID00095061	You do not need to convince him alone. Draw upon history. The past of other Legates are not filled with victories. Remind Lanius of this.
GID00095062	There are other Legates, and the one before Lanius couldn't take Hoover Dam for Caesar.
GID00095063	Yes. Graham was broken on the wall of the Dam.
GID00095064	There are other Legates, and the one before Lanius couldn't take Hoover Dam for Caesar.
GID00095065	That Legate's mistake is he didn't die trying. His name was Joshua - Joshua Graham. Answered for his failure - twice, some say.
GID00095066	Caesar had him burned and cast into the earth, into the largest canyon you've ever seen. Watched the flames trail all the way to the bottom.
GID00095067	Somehow Joshua walked away from that, went beyond Caesar's gaze. His footsteps trailing fire, walking from one hell - maybe to another.
GID00095068	When one is ruined like Graham was... sometimes home is the only place left. If so, he went to New Canaan, Caesar's anger written on him like a book.
GID00095069	Caesar's orders to the Frumentarii were to watch for him, find Graham. Kill him. Didn't try. Could've, no good would have come of it.
GID00095070	Graham earned his life, and his nature... it'll kill him more surely than any blade of the Legion.
GID00095071	So if you've heard word of it or seen sign of him, let it keep. Let his history keep.
GID00095072	The Divide belongs to history now. The Mojave awaits.
GID00095073	The Divide belongs to history now. The Mojave awaits.
GID00095074	My tribe? That log... no, it concerned the White Legs, training them to kill. For Caesar.
GID00095075	There is no meaning there beyond the road to New Canaan. The history of the murder of its people. And Caesar's past.
GID00095076	[SUCCEEDED] Your actions have carried strength.
GID00095077	[SUCCEEDED] There is conviction in your words, enough to rival a Legate, perhaps Caesar. You believe what you say.
GID00095078	[SUCCEEDED] Your actions have carried strength. More importantly, not for House, but for the families on the Strip.
GID00095079	[FAILED] Words are not enough to bear the weight of your flag - if you follow anything at all.
GID00095080	Speeches are things of NCR, words without strength. Your actions have shown nothing. Your flag will burn. The Mojave will follow.
GID00095081	[FAILED] You came from the West, walked there. You carry its sickness East to the Legion - and do not believe their cause enough to honor them.
GID00095082	What I give the Legion is a swifter death than the disease you bring. You have not the strength to bear a Legion standard.
GID00095083	[FAILED] You serve Vegas ghosts, not the tribes Vegas devoured. House is not the people of Vegas - you have walked the Strip, yet have seen nothing.
GID00095084	Your carelessness for the paths you walk - it has destroyed the city you serve. NCR will burn. Then the walls of Vegas will follow.
GID00095085	[FAILED] Yet you follow nothing at all.
GID00095086	You have walked the Mojave, let the shadow of flags fall upon you, yet walk carelessly, no allegiance. Your words - empty as your actions.
GID00095087	If you speak for the two-headed Bear, I'll hear your words. Even if I will be the only one to hear them.
GID00095088	If you believe it should not die this day... then answer me why.
GID00095089	If you feel I do not know the Legion's strength - then I will listen.
GID00095090	If the ghosts of Vegas have come from behind their wall to speak for the West, I'll hear their words.
GID00095091	If you believe that Vegas does not deserve to die as the Bear does... then answer me why.
GID00095092	If you seek to anger me, words won't be enough. Your moral ground is weak here in the Divide.
GID00095093	Blame you? No, learned from you. Both the weapon to kill a nation, and the strength to do it.
GID00095094	You showed me a road, a way to carry my message. You've already answered for what you've done. Now the flag you follow will answer for it.
GID00095095	No, now there is purpose. I believe you when you say you were... careless. The Divide... the Chip... the machine you brought here...
GID00095096	Many messages can be taken from that, intended or not. What I do now is an act of conviction.
GID00095097	No, the West. The East. It doesn't matter - the death of either one kills the other, Vegas along with it. The West shall answer first.
GID00095098	No, not the Mojave. The West, all that's been built since America died. Same symbols as before the war, now a flag carried by a tribe of children.
GID00095099	You walked the West, didn't stay. You know the reason... the Bear grows without structure, follows a symbol without knowing its history.
GID00095100	No... the paths we've walked. The roads, and the flags above them, carry equal blame.
GID00095101	My home in the East, Dry Wells, is no more. It is part of the Legion.
GID00095102	The only other home... the chance of a home... was what you built at the Divide. Then you destroyed it.
GID00095103	And knowing that you believe in the Bear's sickness and have given it strength... then that gives more reason to lay waste to your homeland.
GID00095104	The sickness of the Bear already lies within you, even if you uphold the East. If there were time, I would let you kill the Legion.
GID00095105	But no, the Legion will burn as well. Without the West to challenge it... its shore will be closer than before. It will feed on itself, die.
GID00095106	Without NCR to support it, Vegas will fall to the Legion. That grave of lights, back to dust and ghosts, as was meant.
GID00095107	After this, only one flag will remain over the Mojave. Let that one fly, or destroy itself.
GID00095108	You don't see, listen - even when it's all around you, no matter if I nailed it into your head like a gift from Caesar.
GID00095109	You brought the Divide to life, Courier. You walked the road. Brought the Bear, then the Bull, brought me, following your tracks.
GID00095110	And when I saw the Divide you made, I saw a second chance, a new way of thinking. My world - no longer the East.
GID00095111	Then you brought the West in that package. Destroyed it all. Nearly killed me, flesh and spirit.
GID00095112	You destroyed something larger than the Bear, greater than the Bull. And even when you could have turned away, you brought it again, in that machine.
GID00095113	You destroyed a nation taking its first breath. A place that could have been my home. Now, I'll destroy yours.
GID00095114	No need to destroy the Bear, just cut its throat.
GID00095115	You taught me that at the Divide - only need to cut off the supply line, the road, to watch something greater die.
GID00095116	I'll turn the Long 15 into miles of fire, cut off the Mojave. NCR will fall back, lose Hoover Dam... and leave their throats exposed to the Legion.
GID00095117	You destroyed your own homeland. Seeing a nation burn? Didn't think that would matter any more to you.
GID00095118	There's a strength in that... lack of attachment. Still, you're here now. If there's no more answers you want, then we'll end this.
GID00095119	[SUCCEEDED] History has proven this. Our history.
GID00095120	And you think that you have this strength? Enough for all of NCR?
GID00095121	The West is not the Divide, and nothing you can do can prevent the missile's launch. Convincing me - changes nothing.
GID00095122	[FAILED] No... your answer is not enough.
GID00095123	They deserve what comes... and should answer for it, as you should. The Bear is a thing of the people that gather to it, as are all symbols.
GID00095124	You believe. Yet... you believe in the wrong symbol. Let it give you what strength it can... soon, it will be no more.
GID00095125	Fear? No. Anger.
GID00095126	If you've heard my words and that's all you've taken from them, then I was right to cast them aside.
GID00095127	If you ever had any ability to hear anything beyond your own footsteps... the Divide silenced it. Now, its voice will end you.
GID00095128	So... you resort to trickery. You were hoping that you could deceive me, reveal that somehow I can stop all this.
GID00095129	Fire will rain on the West and the East, as intended, and the last words of the messenger of the Bull - nothing but lies.
GID00095130	The West will burn, as intended, and Vegas will follow. The last words of its messenger, were not for the people of the city, but lies and deceit.
GID00095131	Your nation will burn, as intended, and the last words of its messenger, were not for its people, but to beg for mercy.
GID00095132	It may be... that as much destruction has been written in the earth here... you may build something else, as you built the Divide.
GID00095133	You have spoken truly. There is a shadow of a nation behind you, the hope of a people... yet it may not matter. The Divide still stands against us.
GID00095134	It is... enough.
GID00095135	Our enemies gather outside... shadows of the Bear and Bull... they will have found their way in, just as you did.
GID00095136	It was always my intention - in case I could not kill you, the Marked Men would flood this place, cut off your escape.
GID00095137	If we cannot prevent what comes, then let us make our stand here. Two Couriers, together, at the Divide.
GID00095138	[SUCCEEDED] History has proven this. Our history.
GID00095139	And you think that you have this strength? Enough to hold up NCR, long enough so that Vegas may live again?
GID00095140	Even if you speak for Vegas and its ghosts, nothing you can do can prevent the missile's launch. Convincing me - changes nothing.
GID00095141	[FAILED] No... your answer is not enough.
GID00095142	They deserve what comes. Vegas is born of the corrupt, the blind, lost, that gather to it. Without them... it would fall dark.
GID00095143	You believe. Yet... you have been blinded by the wrong symbol. Let its light give you what strength it can... today marks its end.
GID00095144	When I asked that question, death was certain. I wasn't begging for mercy.
GID00095145	[SUCCEEDED] History has proven this. Our history.
GID00095146	You seek to use your own crimes to prevent mine. There... is a strange honor in that. Perhaps the shadow of the Bull does walk with you.
GID00095147	The West, the East - they are not the Divide, and nothing you can do can prevent the missile's launch. Convincing me - changes nothing.
GID00095148	[FAILED] You answer me with questions. Doubt. You were strong enough to come here - but not strong enough to speak for all the Legion.
GID00095149	This is the ending they deserve... a flag is a thing of the people that gather to it, as are all symbols.
GID00095150	You believe. Yet you do not see that killing a symbol with its own weapon carries justice of its own... just as it will when the East dies as well.
GID00095151	I never sought to escape. I went to them to get an answer or die.
GID00095152	I spoke those words in anger, and I did not expect an answer. All was lost... I thought it was the end.
GID00095153	Past their graves of failed technology, they had cared about the flag they had followed... and the people beneath it. Even with them dead and gone.
GID00095154	But there's no answer in that. I do this because I care, because I believe it must be done.
GID00095155	Kill them - no. The symbol they follow? Yes, as surely as you did at the Divide.
GID00095156	Just? There was no justice in it, it was an act of carelessness, a coward. Killing an idea, before it had a chance...
GID00095157	I see your meaning. You're tying this to our history... but it is different. The symbol I destroy, it has already proven itself wrong.
GID00095158	Those are my words. After what happened with the Brotherhood... talking with them.
GID00095159	Then with the rulers of the Big Empty. But it is their philosophy that was flawed - their weapons, used with new perspective...
GID00095160	Those weapons can be used to kill a symbol that has already proven itself wrong.
GID00095161	There is truth in that. History has proven it.
GID00095162	But Mojave's proof that no homeland is sacred... until the larger symbols are destroyed.
GID00095163	Whatever is built, the Bear, Bull... even Vegas... will tear it apart, convert it, either with purpose, or by accident.
GID00095164	Both. Why do you care.
GID00095165	Test it. As you test me? As if you believe there is some other road here.
GID00095166	Nothing can prevent what comes. The missiles will launch. These questions - your words, or mine - what do they matter to you.
GID00095167	As you defend it now?
GID00095168	New Canaan? My tribe?
GID00095169	The White Legs? To even claim they were shadows of the Twisted Hairs...
GID00095170	No, whatever words you heard, they were not mine.
GID00095171	Respect...?
GID00095172	The braids I wore. They took that from me, thought it made them more like me, more willing to have Caesar listen.
GID00095173	They didn't know what the braids meant, the mark of my tribe before Caesar came... before Vulpes came for them at Dry Wells.
GID00095174	There was death in that meeting, even while Vulpes smiled - asked for our help against the other tribes.
GID00095175	All the while, they were looking to cast our history on the fire. And did. Another tribe, consumed by the Bull - nothing left.
GID00095176	Respect the White Legs? That tribe of jackals? Never.
GID00095177	No, they didn't. They were ended, completely. Became part of history's march.
GID00095178	If you feel there is meaning in the White Legs taking the braids of my tribe... what they did... insult, not respect.
GID00095179	Both... both survived, pieces of them. Remnants, nothing more.
GID00095180	Back to symbols and history, then. Hard to kill... like Couriers.
GID00095181	You're saying when the meaning gets lost - that what happens here, can make things worse. Happened in the Mojave. Flags of the Bear and Bull.
GID00095182	What do I care for your perspective. You walk blindly, foolishly into death, your own and others.
GID00095183	You do not rule my actions, and do not mistake my acts for yours.
GID00095184	The machine made from the parts of Navarro? It had only one message in its core - to get home, at any cost.
GID00095185	It echoes its master... and soon the missiles here will as well.
GID00095186	Nothing can prevent what comes. The missiles will launch. These questions - your words, or mine - what do they matter to you.
GID00095187	No. You are wrong. Words will not bridge this.
GID00095188	You were tricked. Still, you take pride in it.
GID00095189	Nothing can prevent what comes. The missiles will launch. These questions - your words, or mine - what do they matter to you.
GID00095190	We fight over how we will be remembered, then.
GID00095191	There is nothing inside the machine except the means to awaken the missiles in the Divide. That is its only message.
GID00095192	You lie. There was only one message in the machine, only one message in the package you brought.
GID00095193	The Divide bore the symbol of America... as did the package from Navarro. The origins of the machine is... of no importance.
GID00095194	What do you seek to gain by telling me this. If you think that the symbol I wear is a weakness...
GID00095195	If we must survive to carry its message... then that is what shall be done. I will not let America die here.
GID00095196	But... it may not matter. Even if we lay down our weapons, the Divide... it still stands against us.
GID00095197	Experiment log 369248/B - Eyebot Duraframe universal interface override system. This is Dr. Whitley presiding.
GID00095198	We've boosted signal gain and enlarged the overflow buffer system. That should ensure 100% connectivity and control. ED-E, whenever you're ready.
GID00095199	<Electronic sounds>
GID00095200	Yes! Success! Um, reporting full success on 369248/B. ED-E was able to interface with and override the test panel in under three seconds.
GID00095201	Great job, team. Now, let's start on the proposal for the full rollout.
GID00095202	<Distressed beeping>
GID00095203	Dr. Grant? What the hell do you think you're doing?
GID00095204	You didn't even disengage his damage-avoidance protocols! You're hurting him!
GID00095205	Get the hell out of here!
GID00095206	Ah, Whitley, there you are. Orders from Colonel Autumn - he feels the Eyebot Duraframe project isn't advancing quickly enough. I'm to-
GID00095207	Don't be ridiculous, it's just a machine. See here, I've already increased the navigation system's efficiency by 65%.
GID00095208	Fine, Whitley, it's your lab. At least until I tell the Colonel about this.
GID00095209	I don't believe it! Grant actually went to Colonel Autumn and got approval for her damned "efficiency guidelines!"
GID00095210	"All experiments will be carried out with the test subject fully active, to reduce iteration time." It's barbaric!
GID00095211	I've explained this to the Colonel - just because the Eyebots don't have true AI doesn't mean they're just machines.
GID00095212	I guess results are all that matter around here. Forget things like "ethical procedures" or "humane treatment."
GID00095213	I'm starting to have serious misgivings about leadership around here. At least I've got you to talk to, huh ED-E?
GID00095214	All due respect sir, I think you're making a mistake. We're close to a breakthrough with the Duraframe Eyebots, I can feel it! Yes, sir.
GID00095215	Yes sir, I understand that we need the Duraframe assets for Hellfire armor, but-No, sir. Yes, sir. I understand, sir.
GID00095216	I'll tell the team to start disassembling the ED series prototypes right away.
GID00095217	ED-E, you little rascal. Were you eavesdropping again? I think those videos you watch are a bad influence on you. How much of that did you hear?
GID00095218	<Sad beeping>
GID00095219	Hmm... didn't Dr. Grant say she'd upgraded your navigational systems? I think I have an idea.... How'd you like to be just like RALPHIE?
GID00095220	Good, you're back on-line. Listen to me, ED-E - if you stay here, they'll dismantle you for parts. You have to go now.
GID00095221	I've uploaded destination coordinates for our outpost in Navarro into your system. I want you to go to the Enclave there, okay?
GID00095222	Do you understand me? It's going to be a long journey, my little friend. You'll have to fly very far, and fly very fast. Can you do that?
GID00095223	<Sad beeping>
GID00095224	I know you can. Be careful out there, ED-E. Maybe I'll see you again some day.
GID00095225	<Music, followed by gunshots.>
GID00095226	Dad! Hey Dad! Check out this robot I found!
GID00095227	He's not dangerous! Look, he's hurt! Can we take him home, Dad? Maybe Mom can fix him!
GID00095228	Please? He looks so lonely! Maybe if Mom fixes him, he can help her out around the garage?
GID00095229	Yay! He'll be just like RALPHIE, only this one's not a toy!
GID00095230	Next week on RALPHIE the Robot's Incredible Odyssey!
GID00095231	Tune in next Saturday for the exciting conclusion! Only on Vault-Tec Channel 9!
GID00095232	Experiment log 369248/A - Eyebot Duraframe universal interface override system. This is Dr. Whitley presiding.
GID00095233	Initial tests of the override system are promising. Against unsecured or lightly-encrypted targets, the Eyebots have a 98% success rate.
GID00095234	More heavily protected systems are still problematic. Military-grade encryption presents a very real possibility of critical overload of key systems.
GID00095235	We've stopped tests before any robots were destroyed, but if we don't address the problem our Eyebots will fry themselves hacking military networks.
GID00095236	<Excited beeping>
GID00095237	<Excited beeping>
GID00095238	<Excited beeping>
GID00095239	<Happy beeping>
GID00095240	<Happy beeping>
GID00095241	<Happy beeping>
GID00095242	<Sad beeping>
GID00095243	<Sad beeping>
GID00095244	<Sad beeping>
GID00095245	<Scared beeping>
GID00095246	<Scared beeping>
GID00095247	<Scared beeping>
GID00095248	There's your signal... faint, but there. Just like NCR - voice without fire, without strength, sick.
GID00095249	Heard tales of you walking the Mojave. Giving the two-headed bear strength. Giving hollow men like Kimball, like Crocker, half the life Hanlon had.
GID00095250	Now... let's test that strength. That... "conviction." Courier.
GID00095251	There's your signal... faint, but there. A woman in Caesar's service. Looks like the Bear has had its victory, after all.
GID00095252	There's your signal... faint, but there. Charging ahead, like the rest of our brothers, blood in your eyes.
GID00095253	Taking your chances, coming here. Just like bringing the lord of Vegas his tribute, bending your knee to Old World ghosts.
GID00095254	You and that Chip - deserve each other, twenty-nine less coins than other traitors have carried, if history's true.
GID00095255	Now see the road the Old World paves... and what the lights of New Vegas promise, if they haven't blinded your eyes.
GID00095256	There's your signal. Faint, but there. You came, good. Curious, maybe.
GID00095257	You walked the Mojave without a flag on your back. That'll end soon, can't walk the Long 15 and not have a nation's shadow fall on you.
GID00095258	Maybe you just need to be tested. Or you believe in nothing. We'll see.
GID00095261	There you are, you went quiet for a time... knew killing the Bear wouldn't prove easy... you and your machine, you survived.
GID00095262	There's a lesson here, in the Divide. Old World history about paving and intentions could teach the Republic a thing or two - if they listened.
GID00095263	They have an idea of trying to do what's right, never quite getting there. Maybe you've seen it - Nipton, elsewhere.
GID00095264	Picking up the signal from your machine... was quiet for a time, thought the Road had claimed another of the Legion.
GID00095265	Too many of the Bull have already fallen here... to radiation, fire... and what burrows below.
GID00095266	There you are, you went quiet for a time... thought you might have returned to Vegas, its comforts. Maybe you took that machine with you.
GID00095267	There's a lesson here, in the Divide. Old World history about holding on to something so tightly it breaks... or falls apart.
GID00095268	May have seen the cracks in Vegas's walls already. If so, they'll grow, in time, no matter how much you back House.
GID00095269	There you are, you went quiet for a time. Then that signal came in strong from your machine, like a heartbeat.
GID00095270	Made your way through Old World towns, the tunnels that join them... now, the High Road.
GID00095271	For all you've seen behind you - there's worse along this stretch. Deathclaws - hunt the Marked Men, and they also hunt what burrows below.
GID00095273	Hopeville, High Road, Ashton... tiny cracks in the Earth, nothing compared to the road carved ahead.
GID00095274	Before you... this is the edge of the Divide. Ahead lies your work, the history you burned in the earth. What you brought to the people here.
GID00095275	Thought that explosion, that building falling deep in the Divide might have been your work... wouldn't kill you, maybe close.
GID00095276	Knew you'd survive... but no need to go any farther. You've brought me what I need - that machine with you, sealed in the Hopeville silo.
GID00095277	Needed someone to unlock it - bring it home. Now the signal's strong enough, no need for you to carry it anymore. I can call your machine to me.
GID00095278	As for the Courier... he turned his back on his home for the second time and made his way back, navigating the treachery of the Divide.
GID00095279	As for the Courier... she turned her back on her home for the second time and made her way back, navigating the treachery of the Divide.
GID00095280	Tunnelers and the Marked Men... avoided the lone figure, as if recognizing the Courier's right to passage... or out of fear.
GID00095281	ED-E, the version given life by the machines of the Divide, remained frozen in the military installation where Ulysses had summoned him.
GID00095282	The robot's last coded transmission back to his counterpart in the Mojave told of upgrades, unlocked memories... then silence.
GID00095283	Not long after the Courier left the facility, the Eyebot's data banks were wiped, and it was disassembled as rapidly as it had been constructed.
GID00095284	When ED-E's circuits burned in the fires of the Divide, there was one small part that held on until the end.
GID00095285	It was the fragment that held the Old World memories and the words of his creator in his last moments.
GID00095286	As his last gesture, he sent one last signal to his counterpart in the Mojave, passing along what the Courier had taught him in the Divide.
GID00095287	There was the chance... always, that ED-E's journey would continue, perhaps carried by another Eyebot in the Mojave...
GID00095288	...the one from which the ED-E from the Divide had been shaped.
GID00095289	For now, the Courier knew ED-E's history and could carry it, even if the Eyebot had forgotten.
GID00095290	ED-E, given second life by the machines of the Divide, freed by the Courier, continued his quest west, to Navarro...
GID00095291	...or what remained of what the Eyebot considered "home." Whether he found his homeland or not, his road is unknown.
GID00095292	It may be the journey meant more than the destination - just as his counterpart in the Mojave had learned.
GID00095293	Before leaving, he sent a coded signal to his original in the Mojave, passing along what the Courier had taught him in the Divide.
GID00095294	With that last farewell, he set off, carrying the song of Old World hope with him, which had given him strength and purpose on his journey.
GID00095295	And no matter what, he knew there would be a second home to return to, Navarro or not - and that his creator would be proud.
GID00095296	And this road - has reached its end.
GID00095297	...missiles fell on NCR and the Long 15 caravan route beyond the Mojave Outpost, the road the Courier had been walking when the tale began.
GID00095298	Caravans and NCR outposts along the route were reduced to ash, an Old World gift from the Divide.
GID00095299	...missiles fell on the East and the Legion encampment at Dry Wells... where the Twisted Hairs had allied, then been betrayed by Vulpes and Caesar.
GID00095300	Legion soldiers died, their silhouettes blasted into the ground and earth, the last word of the last of the Twisted Hairs.
GID00095301	As catastrophic as the damage was for NCR, the act made the Courier stronger for having no history, and no retreat.
GID00095302	It was an ending to things - a way of erasing the road that had led to this point and the history that had walked with it.
GID00095303	It was an ending to things - a way of erasing the road that had led to this point and the history that had walked with it.
GID00095304	The Couriers finally, really did it. They blew up the lands West and East of the Mojave... damning them all to hell.
GID00095305	The act was discovered 200 years later, as other Couriers explored the Mojave wastes.
GID00095306	There, they saw NCR relics, reminders of their once proud history.
GID00095307	The Divide erupted in fire, violent, red, as the last message of the two Couriers arced into the sky...
GID00095308	The missiles rained like spears down on the land, burning flags and communities alike... destroying all they struck.
GID00095309	The history of the West was erased for the second time, thorough and complete... and America slept once more.
GID00095310	The Divide erupted in fire as the flame trail of the two Couriers' last message arced into the sky...
GID00095311	It's said war - war never changes.
GID00095312	Men do, through the roads they walk.
GID00095313	Women do, through the roads they walk.
GID00095314	Hopeville burned lightless in the night, invisible fires of radiation scorching it from within and without.
GID00095315	It is said a man still walked its streets, with a tattered jacket, an Old World flag etched on the back...
GID00095316	He remained there, perhaps as punishment for the scars he left on the wastes - or a reminder of a history he could not forget.
GID00095317	For Ulysses... his journey was over. The Courier had been the end of his road.
GID00095318	At the end of the struggle, only one Courier remained in the heart of the Divide. The true Courier, Courier Six.
GID00095319	The Courier tore the ancient flag of the Commonwealth from its cables, and cast it over the corpse...
GID00095320	...though whether done as a sign of respect, or in anger for what had been endured to reach this moment - that is unknown.
GID00095321	Interpretation is something best left to history, and only the surviving Courier would ever know for certain.
GID00095322	The Courier walked until he stood again upon the edge of the Divide, the last road he would walk before the second battle for Hoover Dam.
GID00095323	There, beside his feet, was a final package, from one Courier to another - a footlocker, bearing a gift, and a message.
GID00095324	The Courier walked until she stood again upon the edge of the Divide, the last road she would walk before the second battle for Hoover Dam.
GID00095325	There, beside her feet, was a final package, from one Courier to another - a footlocker, bearing a gift, and a message.
GID00095326	But that message - it is something for Couriers to carry, and for them alone.
GID00095327	The lights flickered across the Divide, reminders that the Old World histories persist, and find meaning in the present.
GID00095328	...back again. Left that crater behind. Got a few holotapes left, ones from the medical center.
GID00095329	The woman... she fixed the recorder. Said it wouldn't last, repayment for me fixing her. She doesn't like debts, can respect that.
GID00095330	Payment enough, just to hear someone who believes in the Brotherhood of Steel. Not Elijah. Different view. Same madness.
GID00095331	She answered me on their philosophy, their way of seeing - the roads they walk. Dead-ends. Empty... as if technology can solve anything.
GID00095332	Big Empty's proof where that road leads. Just like the Divide, and all the roads that lead to it.
GID00095333	Big Empty - there's something hidden there, a crater, past wind and sand - so deep in the desert, there's no turning back.
GID00095334	Finding the crater was an accident, was following the weather patterns - the Divide sky torn like that, man's violence, not nature's.
GID00095335	That violence in the sky, had a source. Tracked it. Like following a river current.
GID00095336	Left the colors to mark my way, like always, case someone finds them, learns the pattern - the Courier might.
GID00095337	When I thought sand and wind would never end... came to the crater.
GID00095338	And there... there was an Old World facility, a weather station, at the edge, still raking the sky with electricity and generators.
GID00095339	And beyond it... saw the rest of the Old World hell there, all carved up like garden plots. Had to see what was there, couldn't leave it be.
GID00095340	Things sleep in the Big Empty, the Brotherhood woke them up - can't move quiet, any more than the two-headed Bear can.
GID00095341	And when they woke up, it was like all of history waking up at once. Almost didn't make it out. Almost. Left with answers I never intended.
GID00095342	Have you ever wanted to speak to history - just to know the why of it? I don't. Not any longer.
GID00095343	There's old stories about gods and men, past history, into myth - where the gods, they're like children... petulant, cruel.
GID00095344	Those were the voices of the Big Empty, the past. Couldn't leave well enough alone, had to ask. Had to ask the why of it.
GID00095345	Their answers were madness. And power, stronger than me, would take a hundred Elijahs... someone tougher than him or I to best them in their Dome.
GID00095346	They didn't know why they were there, what had led to that point, their names - like serpents devouring themselves, cannibalizing their own thoughts.
GID00095347	When all seemed lost, thought it was the end - my anger gave me strength to ask them my last question.
GID00095348	"Who are you, that do not know your history?"
GID00095349	And they awoke. For... a short time.
GID00095350	The flag you wear, they said. We remember. America.
GID00095351	It wasn't just a flag to them... it was a place, an idea they had cared for. Once.
GID00095352	They told me what it was like to grow in that world... all they had done to lift it up... protect it. They... didn't know it was gone, that...
GID00095353	...yet they had cared once. Before forgetting their history.
GID00095354	As they were talking... kept seeing the Courier's shadow behind them, giving each their words weight. History cast aside... a home, left behind.
GID00095355	I listened. I asked. Was there anything left? Anything that still carries America's voice?
GID00095356	And they told me I had already been there. I and one other, walking right out of history deeper than we knew.
GID00095357	They told me what lies in the heart of the Divide, what can be found there. And the words to awaken it - and the one to speak them.
GID00095358	Destroying my machines won't help you. This facility will make more.
GID00095359	Don't need Old World medicine to kill you.
GID00095360	Didn't think you'd outlast the machines. Good.
GID00095361	Just you and me, then. Always was.
GID00095362	Can't stop the Old World's return, Courier.
GID00095363	Took my machines? Hnh. Underestimated you.
GID00095364	Machines might keep you alive, but they won't save you.
GID00095365	No more echoes of the Bull and the Bear. The rest will share their fate.
GID00095366	The dead men of the New World... they've come for you.
GID00095367	Kill as many as you want - the Divide will birth more.
GID00095368	Killing them is mercy.
GID00095369	I'll end you - and your history.
GID00095370	Come all this way - to die alone.
GID00095371	Running out of time, Courier.
GID00095372	Last tape, last message. In case... you best me. If you're hearing this, you have, through blood or word.
GID00095373	This message, and all that lies with it - it is for you, Courier. If you want to know the... why of things.
GID00095374	This world, I've walked a good part of it... I stopped only because of you. What you did - gave me pause.
GID00095375	Long ago, I crossed the Colorado, the first among the Legion to see Hoover Dam in all its glory... an Old World wall, yet bridging two sides.
GID00095376	And beyond it, a symbol of a two-headed Bear, an idea great enough to challenge Caesar himself.
GID00095377	Might kill him, taking it, whether he won or lost. The Bull needs to fight, needs the challenge, without it... it falters, dies in the dust.
GID00095378	Might be a lesson there, in you and me. Leave the thought behind the message to you.
GID00095379	My message is this - the destruction that has been wrought, at the Divide - or elsewhere, if you couldn't stop me...
GID00095380	It can happen again. It will keep happening.
GID00095381	If war doesn't change, men must change, and so must their symbols. Even if it is nothing at all, know what you follow, Courier...
GID00095382	...just as I followed you, to the end. Whatever your symbol...
GID00095383	...carry it on your back, and wear it proudly when you stand at Hoover Dam.
GID00095384	Even in this place, NCR's shadow falls. Or is it just, you, Courier, without the Bear's corpse to weigh you down.
GID00095385	So you came, Frumentarii, Courier - whatever you are now. Come to carry out Caesar's law? His voice carries no weight here.
GID00095386	Your city, Vegas, lies in the other direction... with the rest of its slaves. Or is it just, you, Courier, without the lights and ghosts.
GID00095387	So you came, Courier, to what - watch your homeland burn one last time. Kill me, perhaps.
GID00095388	Judging by your shadow... maybe you can't let your machine go. Doesn't matter now.
GID00095389	Either way, the Divide giants are awakening. The missiles here, on their way home. There is no way to stop them.
GID00095390	You are too late. The Divide is awakening - the package, and the message within, have come full circle.
GID00095391	The sequence has begun, just as before. Except this time, the missiles will touch the sky instead of being locked beneath the ground.
GID00095392	We've broken them. The Bear and the Bull have no more shadows to throw at us.
GID00095393	They come for us, East and West alike.
GID00095394	We've shown them fear, but not enough. More will come.
GID00095395	Watch the shadows - the beasts cloak themselves in Old World tech.
GID00095396	Watch the floor. Mines. Tactics of the Bear.
GID00095397	Another Old World soldier falls.
GID00095398	Old World's running out of machines.
GID00095399	Beasts from the Divide. To the Divide, they return.
GID00095400	Mercy killings - let them rest.
GID00095401	You have forgotten all you were, traded glory for savagery. Fitting.
GID00095402	Emptiness here - like the sands of the Great Salt Lake, echoed. The beating in the Divide sky... like storm drums of the White Legs.
GID00095403	Ran with them on the salt beds, at Caesar's command - cut the throats of the two-headed Bear, cut all communities off.
GID00095404	Use storm, sky. Disease. Fire, starvation... and the violence of the ignorant to ruin all who could... might stand against him.
GID00095405	But the White Legs... they couldn't live on their own, like most scavengers. So gave them purpose - turned their hunger into a weapon.
GID00095406	The wall of New Canaan... too high for Caesar. Too proud, maybe - or maybe something there, from his past, that needed killing. Memory of Graham.
GID00095407	Helped them dig out Canaan supply caches, and other secrets the sands hid - bunkers, filled with powered weapons even the Brotherhood might desire.
GID00095408	They called these new weapons "storm drums" in the firing of shells. Taught them the power in the casings... to channel the spirits in their guns.
GID00095409	Me... they called me the Flag-Bearer. Glory in my hand, in my staff that still bore the weight of the Old World just as the symbol on my back did.
GID00095410	I learned their weapons as a means of respect. And when it came their turn to pay respect to me... history came rushing back.
GID00095411	Can't escape what's been done. History's there... no matter how far you walk.
GID00095412	I walked the Great Salt Lake as Caesar's eye, then his hand.
GID00095413	Mongrels there, two-legs and four. Saw the walls of New Canaan the scavengers circled... hadn't the strength or fire to take. Too high, too strong.
GID00095414	White Legs, they were born for war, they run to it, hungry for battle... yet their hunger is to be a part of history, something larger.
GID00095415	Like the Legion. As always, brought them a message - from Caesar.
GID00095416	If New Canaan burns, Caesar might see them. "Might." Even the chance was a lie.
GID00095417	To honor Caesar - destroy the history of New Canaan, and the way they carry it - in their generations and family.
GID00095418	Caesar respects such strength, I told them. That - that was truth, even if "strength" wasn't the word. Obedience.
GID00095419	You must be willing to kill anyone, children, mothers, the weak, elders... if these New Canaanites value the generations, that is what you must kill.
GID00095420	It was like Vulpes was speaking through me. Use the night, silence, and fire to change their words to pleas, to screams.
GID00095421	No need for bombs when hate will do.
GID00095422	I... asked the White Legs to destroy a people with ancestry, going back thousands of years - another death of history, lost to time.
GID00095423	The New Canaanites... they supplied medicine. Food, traded with others. Civilization, a hand from the past, not history...
GID00095424	...but maybe a past deeper, farther than that to a place where this... God really exists.
GID00095425	If so, his handiwork and people belong elsewhere, not in this place. Another symbol, like Bear and Bull, with no meaning in the present.
GID00095426	The White Legs... meant to show respect, bribe me for Caesar's favor, echoing mannerisms and words...
GID00095427	Showed them tech caches, taught them the workings of chamber and powder, spoke of Caesar's pride in those that used such things... lies. And...
GID00095428	...and then... they tried to honor me - not the Legion.
GID00095429	They brought me before the campfire one night, showed me how they changed themselves, how they wore their hair now.
GID00095430	It was like my entire dead tribe in the firelight, teeth grinning red in the dark - eager corpses, blood-covered ghosts.
GID00095431	They... had taken my braids, the way of the Twisted Hairs, as if it showed they were like me, of me...
GID00095432	...while every knot in their braids spoke of raping, violence - and ignorance of what the knots meant. They thought to show respect... defiled it.
GID00095433	Lost myself in trying to read the braids they wove, when I remembered they had put no meaning in it. They had no history of what it meant.
GID00095434	They didn't even know the insult in the twists, knots... and Dry Wells came rushing back, the White Legs circled like that...
GID00095435	It was like looking at the dead of my tribe, reborn as ghosts - hateful, hungry, bowing to Caesar. Another history... gone, carried by me alone.
GID00095436	<Sneaky beeping>
GID00095437	<Strained beeping>
GID00095438	<Confirmatory beeping>
GID00095439	<Confirmatory beeping>
GID00095440	<Confirmatory beeping>
GID00095441	Got you.
GID00095442	Let's end this.
GID00095443	End of the road.
GID00095444	We'll see what you stand for.
GID00095445	<Combat beeping>
GID00095446	<Happy beeping>
GID00095447	<Confirmatory beeping>

GID00095456	<Confirmatory beeping>
GID00095457	<Confirmatory beeping>
GID00095458	<Confirmatory beeping>
GID00095459	Won't lose you again.
GID00095460	Didn't walk through ash and hell to lose you now.
GID00095461	<Alert music>
GID00095462	Whatever it was, gone now.
GID00095463	Comes back, we'll deal with it then.
GID00095464	<Frustrated beeping>
GID00095465	Must've taken cover.
GID00095466	Gone to ground.
GID00095467	<Scanning beeping>
GID00095468	Gone.
GID00095469	Must've took off. Won't leave - not yet.
GID00095470	<Triumphant beeping>
GID00095471	Comes back, I'll be ready.
GID00095472	Courier'll show soon.
GID00095473	<Frustrated beeping>
GID00095474	Got you.
GID00095475	End you.
GID00095476	<Combat music>
GID00095477	Movement.
GID00095478	Found you.
GID00095479	There.
GID00095480	<Alert music>
GID00095481	Something nearby.
GID00095482	Hear something.
GID00095483	<Warning beeping>
GID00095484	Don't see anything.
GID00095485	Can't be far.
GID00095486	<Seeking beeping>
GID00095487	Something's here.
GID00095488	Checking for movement.
GID00095489	<Curious beeping>
GID00095490	If that's what you wish.
GID00095491	Then let's settle this.
GID00095492	<Aggressive music>
GID00095493	Watch yourself.
GID00095494	Next time, you won't get mercy.
GID00095495	<Triumphant beeping>
GID00095496	Scavenger.
GID00095497	So it's to be my ending, then.
GID00095498	End of the road.
GID00095499	My flag rests here.
GID00095500	Bombs won't save you.
GID00095501	Explosive!
GID00095502	<Warning beeping>
GID00095503	I'll answer fire with fire.
GID00095504	Gift from the Divide.
GID00095505	Need to get some distance.
GID00095506	Stronger than I thought.
GID00095507	<Scared beeping>
GID00095508	<Grunt.>
GID00095509	<Grunt.>
GID00095510	<Combat beeping>
GID00095511	Let's see what you stand for.
GID00095512	The Divide'll be your grave.
GID00095513	Let's have an ending to this.
GID00095514	<Violent music>
GID00095515	<Confirmatory beeping>
GID00095516	Can hear the weight in your feet - you're bound for that Old World wall. Hoover Dam. Maybe not now - in time.
GID00095517	<Happy beeping>
GID00095518	The Divide belongs to history now. The Mojave awaits.
GID00095519	Courier.
GID00095520	Clearing the chamber?
GID00095521	Better off saving ammo.
GID00095522	Fire, and I won't take it lying down.
GID00095523	Better be sure.
GID00095524	A tactic of the Bear.
GID00095525	Worthy of Hanlon.
GID00095526	Watch the blast!
GID00095527	Explosive!
GID00095528	<Grateful beeping>
GID00095529	<Alarmed beeping>
GID00095530	<Music>... RALPHIE... fly far, fly fast!
GID00095531	<Excited beeping>
GID00095532	<Happy beeping>
GID00095533	Not now. Let's settle things here.
GID00095534	If we're done here, let's leave the Divide behind. If we get separated, I'll meet you above Hopeville, near the Canyon Wreckage.
GID00095535	Full circle, walked your road - now back again.
GID00095536	Something else in you needing an answer?
