GID00077068	[Christine nods gratefully. She glances in the direction of the terminal, looks at you, smiles, gives a thumbs up.]
GID00077069	Supposed to be the Grand Opening of the Sierra Madre. Lot of lights, music, the works.
GID00077070	And he's going to use the Gala Event... to open the casino? But... that's... interesting.
GID00077071	Unless you get some Hologram guards lit up in the courtyard below? No dice.
GID00077072	Whoa, whoa, whoa... in the middle of town here? Alone? On a rooftop, with a big lightshow in the air?
GID00077073	Tell you what - why don't you just find one of those Cosmic steak knives so I can slit my wrists, be less painful checking out that way.
GID00077074	Yeah, now. Talk about a captive audience. Or captive entertainer? Eh - whatever.
GID00077075	Stupid? No, playing it smart. You're the dumb one, waltzing in here without realizing who the headliner is.
GID00077076	I can take a chump like you even if I didn't have eight lives lined up behind me, and a rising soundtrack. So put your dancing shoes on - let's go.
GID00077077	No idea... woke up here, thought I was dreaming for a second... right back on stage, the mic...
GID00077078	Thought I was back at the Fronds... well, except no audience, used to pack theaters back then... so stepped up on the stage, check things out...
GID00077079	Then suddenly Holograms walked out of the wings... and they started raising their hands to their heads all creepy-like, not a good sign.
GID00077080	No... looks like a rooftop in Puesta del Sol. In better days, nice view. Now? It's the last place anyone wants to stand when this event goes off.
GID00077081	That place during Spring, Summer, and Fall, a little bit in Winter, is a prime resort spot for Ghost People. Not the best of neighborhoods.
GID00077082	If we're going there, I'm not going alone. And if you have any bright ideas about telling me to stroll over there - or leave me there? No thanks.
GID00077083	No... no, no... I'm not leaving this spot. Why dirty my hands when the Sierra Madre can kill you for me?
GID00077084	Time for a little show - I'll just grab a seat and watch how this plays out from backstage. Security can handle it from here.
GID00077085	Look, I'm more about the short goodbyes than long thankful speeches... but I appreciate you bailing me out of a tight spot there - partner.
GID00077086	I know you didn't do it out of the goodness of your heart. So let me give you something a little more practical - a way we both come out ahead.
GID00077087	I know you didn't do it out of the goodness of your heart. So... instead of empty words and a flourish, let me give you something more useful.
GID00077088	No, I'm not. I'll get out in time - you won't. Once I kill you, exit stage left, and my collar will go quiet.
GID00077089	You think I'm the bad guy here? I'm not the one slapping bomb collars on innocent folks and flicking the switch.
GID00077090	And I'm not stabbing you in the back. I was facing you all the time. This heist? I planned it lifetimes ago. You and that old man? Tourists.
GID00077091	I was already was halfway off the rooftop, through the service tunnel and making a break for the gate before the light show started...
GID00077092	...and before Vera finished her Gala speech... I knew what'd happen with "music" in the streets and lights in the sky... Ghost People. Lots of them.
GID00077093	Also meant the front gate was open, and no way was I missing it after all these years. Then... I walk in... and...
GID00077094	Me? I was halfway off the rooftop, through the service tunnel and bee-lining for the gate before the light show started...
GID00077095	...and before Vera finished her Gala speech... I knew what'd happen with "music" in the streets and lights in the sky... Ghost People. Lots of them.
GID00077096	But that was your problem. Anyway, front gate was open, no way I was letting you get in first. I walk in... there's a flash... and I'm here.
GID00077097	Must have been Sinclair's security... he always had a thing about letting any threats into the casino. Security system's twitchy that way.
GID00077098	Me, though, I'm a guest here, so I guess I got the royal treatment after all.
GID00077099	Good. If necessary, I will guide you through the Villa's broadcast systems - if you get lost, return here, and I'll direct you.
GID00077100	I've downloaded instructions on an audio log to your Pip-Boy in case you can't read... if you forget why you're here, let my voice remind you.
GID00077101	Then go. The Sierra Madre may wait... I will not.
GID00077102	I am short on patience. And you are short on time.
GID00077103	Ask.
GID00077104	I've downloaded the instructions and markers on your Pip-Boy... in case you forget. And yes, I have access to that device on your wrist.
GID00077105	Get the other three here, after that... I'll have more instructions for you.
GID00077106	Do this, I'll let you go. I'll let all of you go.
GID00077107	[Christine glances at the elevator, her expression becomes worried, then she looks back at you, then reluctantly shakes her head.]
GID00077108	[She frowns, then makes a motion as if typing at keys... then she points at you, raises her left wrist and pantomimes talking into it.]
GID00077109	[She points at you, then her, looks right and left, raises two fingers, tries to type, pauses, and slowly shakes her head.]
GID00077110	[She smiles humorlessly. She then nods once slowly. Then she shakes her head slowly.]
GID00077111	[She then looks at you, her face wrinkled in a humorless smile.]
GID00077112	[She points in the direction of the main gate. Then points at your collar, shakes her head, and locks her hands around her neck.]
GID00077113	[Then her hands lash outwards, fingers splayed and she rolls her eyes back. After a second she turns back to you shakes her head.]
GID00077114	[SUCCEEDED] [She nods... slowly, then puts her hand in front her throat, closes it slowly, then points at you.]
GID00077115	[FAILED] [She frowns, narrows her eyes, and looks at you.]
GID00077116	[She moves her finger in a circle, frowns, then drags her hand down over her eyes. She raises them again, points to you.]
GID00077117	Tourists, you bet. They don't stay long... and they don't stay alive long.
GID00077118	If they survive the Cloud, the Ghost People, the traps, then greed takes over, and they start sizing each other up for funeral suits.
GID00077119	"Alive's" a tricky word. The locals, the Ghost People? Not sure it applies to them.
GID00077120	They're a little... uncivilized. They don't talk much. As in, at all.
GID00077121	Why? Survival. I still needed to leave the Residential Area to scrounge up supplies, and I don't like taking chances.
GID00077122	The Villa's dangerous. So I left weapons and stims in case I got in a tight spot. Then, of course, you show up, putting your mitts on everything.
GID00077123	I suppose this qualifies as an emergency, so I'm not complaining. Much.
GID00077124	[Christine shakes her head, then pauses, and makes a small circle with her thumb and forefinger.]
GID00077125	[She points at you, and makes the motion of putting something in her palm.]
GID00077126	[SUCCEEDED] [Christine frowns, then pauses and traces one of the scars on her head with her finger.]
GID00077127	[She then makes a motion as if picking up a pencil, tries to write, then shakes her head.]
GID00077128	[FAILED] [Christine nods, frowns, then points at you, then points West. Then she glares at you.]
GID00077129	[Christine draws a jagged lightning bolt in the air, pantomimes throwing a grenade, and then pulls an imaginary knife from behind her back.]
GID00077130	[Then she moves her feet shoulder width apart, holds hands up in a martial arts stance, then turns both hands into pistols, pantomimes rapid-firing.]
GID00077131	[She then holds one pistol up, takes aim as if sighting along the barrel and does a single shot, ends with a nod.]
GID00077132	Those little company stores? Sinclair's toy boxes, put in a casino chip, get a treat, like you're some dog doing tricks.
GID00077133	Take any of the casino chips, put 'em into the machine, and you'll get something out - a snack, a cola, something to mend a tear in your shirt.
GID00077134	Sometimes you have to know exactly what to ask for, other times, there's codes for... eh, unconventional items. For emergencies.
GID00077135	The Cloud? Showed up after the Bomb. I think. I got used to it in small doses. Now, it covers the city.
GID00077136	Over the years, it kept climbing up out of the Sierra Madre, until it was curtains for the sun. Didn't see the sky again.
GID00077137	Doesn't seem to bother the Ghost People. Can't see through it too well, though, so sometimes I can use the Cloud for cover... if I get desperate.
GID00077138	Residential area, clinic, police station - should keep away from the police station, it's a Ghost People hangout.
GID00077139	Salida del Sol, Puesta del Sol are East Town, West Town. "Sunrise" and "Sunset." Or were when the streets and sky weren't covered with toxic gas.
GID00077140	Ghost People don't come into the Villa much. West Town and East Town, though... they're thick with the Cloud and Ghost People. Like hunting grounds.
GID00077141	Don't be long.
GID00077142	[Christine nods.]
GID00077143	Whatever you're planning, hurry.
GID00077144	Hrnnh. Dog will wait.
GID00077145	If so, the Sierra Madre Casino, in all its glory, is inviting you to Begin Again.
GID00077146	Come to a place where wealth, excitement, and intrigue await around every corner.
GID00077147	Stroll along the winding streets of our beautiful resort, make new friends... or rekindle old flames.
GID00077148	Let your eyes take in the luxurious expanse of the open desert, under clear starlit skies. Gaze straight on into the sunset from our Villa rooftops.
GID00077149	Countless diversions await.
GID00077150	Gamble in our casino, take in the theater, or stay in one of our exclusive executive suites that will shelter you - and cater to your every whim.
GID00077151	So if life's worries have weighed you down... if you need an escape from your troubles... or if you just need an opportunity to begin again, join us.
GID00077152	Let go and leave the world behind at the Sierra Madre grand opening, this October. We'll be waiting.
GID00077153	[The Hologram cashier nods, then a section of the tabletop slides away, and a package rises from it.]
GID00077154	[The Hologram cashier nods, then a section of the tabletop slides away, and a package rises from it.]
GID00077155	[The Hologram cashier nods, takes a step back, then the whole tabletop slides away. A package slowly rises from the opening, steam trailing from it.]
GID00077156	[You place the bills on the counter, a panel flips, taking the bills with it... and 100 Chips appear in their place.]
GID00077157	[You set the stack of bills down. A panel flips, there is a whir, series of clicks, and a stack of chips rises up in place of the bills.]
GID00077158	[Christine stares at the headless corpses for a second. Then she makes a slow, angry scowl.]
GID00077159	The quick... the quick scribe... jumped over the lazy paladin.
GID00077160	Mi-mo-mih.
GID00077161	This is Knight Christine Royce, of the Brotherhood... Christine Royce.
GID00077162	Ugh... feels like a sore throat - after chewing on nails.
GID00077163	Sounds like I smoked a mile of cigarettes.
GID00077164	Feels like the Cloud crawled in my mouth and died.
GID00077165	Chris-tine. Chris-tine. Hello. Hello. Hello.
GID00077166	[Christine makes a sweeping motion of the room, does a deep inhalation, then gives a thumbs up.]
GID00077167	[Christine sniffs the air, then gives a thumbs up.]
GID00077168	[Christine's breathing quickens, and her eyes dart around the walls.]
GID00077169	[Christine seems to be sweating heavily, and her hand is twitching slightly. She looks ready to bolt.]
GID00077170	[Christine nods at the ground, points at her eyes, then points at the ground again, as if in warning.]
GID00077171	[Christine motions at ground, makes a snapping motion with her hand, then taps her eyes and pantomimes walking slowly, looking in front of her.]
GID00077172	[Christine scans the area. She seems on edge, checking the arcades and arches for movement.]
GID00077173	[Christine makes a motion of loading a fake gun, then suiting up.]
GID00077174	Can't believe I came all this way to have my voice stolen.
GID00077175	Guess the Sierra Madre healed me. It doesn't matter, and to be honest, I miss my voice.
GID00077176	I've had enough of you and Elijah running the show. Now it's my turn.
GID00077177	The elevator to the casino vault is here. In the starlet's room? That seems intimate.
GID00077178	Too long. Thought I might have had a chance to settle it before this event happened, but then the chance slipped away again.
GID00077179	He... cut me off from someone I cared about a long time ago. He used his status to break us apart. So I had to find a new purpose, same banner.
GID00077180	Then he became unstable, left a trail of crimes across the wasteland. Once word reached us, I was ordered to kill him.
GID00077181	Do I? It sounds off to my ears... hard to tell. Not to mention it... hurts like hell to swallow.
GID00077182	Might be why I got moved off to this suite... it's hers. That's her over there, got trapped by security like I did. Just took a different way out.
GID00077183	Those are my orders. I've seen what he's done, and I believe in those orders.
GID00077184	[Christine shakes her head, more insistently this time. She points at the elevator, then downwards, then holds herself tightly and shakes her head.]
GID00077185	[She looks at you, blinks again, then opens her mouth - but nothing comes out.]
GID00077186	[She touches her throat, then traces the scar beneath the chin, and her eyes widen in alarm.]
GID00077187	[She looks shaken. As she glances at the Auto-Doc, she recoils, and her mouth opens - but again, nothing comes out.]
GID00077188	[She looks back at you, and her hands clench into fists - her eyes narrow, and she takes a step back, studying you.]
GID00077189	[The woman opens her mouth again, winces, then frowns and drags a finger across her throat in a slow motion. She looks more angry than pained now.]
GID00077190	[Frowning, she touches her throat again, gently, then her hand brushes her collar, then her frown deepens.]
GID00077191	[Her eyes narrow as she traces the edge of the collar until she finds the lock. She begins to press it with her fingers.]
GID00077192	[She looks surprised. Then notices your collar, and raises an eyebrow.]
GID00077193	[She frowns, narrows her eyes, then slowly shakes her head.]
GID00077194	[She shakes her head again and draws a line in the air between the two of you.]
GID00077195	[She shakes her head - once, then crosses her arms.]
GID00077196	[Christine glances straight up, frowns, then turns back to you and taps her wrist.]
GID00077197	[She looks exasperated, then waves her hand in a circle in front of her.]
GID00077198	[She raises an eyebrow, then tilts her head slightly.]
GID00077199	[She frowns, then cups her hand to her ear.]
GID00077200	[She shakes her head... then pauses, and shakes her head again, then looks exasperated.]
GID00077201	[Christine looks blankly at you. Then touches her head, smiles, then shakes her head.]
GID00077202	[She waves her hand, then shakes her head - she then nods in the direction of the casino.]
GID00077203	[She nods with an exasperated look, then makes a circle with her hands, repeats it twice more, then raises her hands and waves them like wings.]
GID00077204	[She puts both hands in front of her, then makes a motion with her hands as if writing something.]
GID00077205	[She nods. She looks impressed.]
GID00077206	[She shrugs. Then she points to you and shrugs.]
GID00077207	[She shakes her head.]
GID00077208	[She touches one of the scars on her cheeks, shakes head. Then touches the scar on her neck, and nods.]
GID00077209	[Christine nods.]
GID00077210	[She shivers slightly, and shakes her head.]
GID00077211	[SUCCEEDED] [She nods, looks impressed.]
GID00077212	[FAILED] [She shakes her head, then nods in the direction of the casino again.]
GID00077213	[She moves her finger in a wider circle, then raises her hand over her eyes.]
GID00077214	[Her eyes widen, and her eyes gauge yours. She then touches her wounds, and her expression crumbles into anger, as if defeated. She slowly nods.]
GID00077215	[Christine narrows her eyes slightly. She slowly nods, then steps slightly behind you.]
GID00077216	[Christine glances at your follower, shakes her head, then points at you, her, and nods in the direction of the fountain.]
GID00077217	[Christine's defeated expression vanishes into a stone-faced glare.]
GID00077218	[Christine gives a brief nod, then turns and begins to walk.]
GID00077219	[She frowns, glances at the collar, looks back at you. She makes a circle with her hands, puts her hand over her eyes and squints.]
GID00077220	[She nods at you, then lowers her hand from her eyes, shakes her head. She draws a slow line between you.]
GID00077221	[She studies you again, then her expression softens slightly. She shakes her head slowly, and gives a silent sigh.]
GID00077222	[She nods at you, then raises an eyebrow and nods at the door.]
GID00077223	Should be able to rewire them, failing that, shoot them, although that'll alert the others, they're on a linked patrol pattern.
GID00077224	He saw me, before the scars, at a place far from here. It's where he found some of the technology he uses now.
GID00077225	It's a place called the Big Empty. The name's deceptive - if you know where to look.
GID00077226	Almost got trapped there. There was someone else, though, who came along. Knew about Elijah.
GID00077227	No idea. A courier. Wore an Old World flag on his back. He was the one who pulled me out there, told me where Elijah had gone.
GID00077228	Helped me heal up, listened to my story. He... sympathized.
GID00077229	He said he understood what it meant to track someone who had such a... impact on his past life.
GID00077230	He said people were like couriers, sometimes never understanding the messages they brought. That's who he was hunting for... some courier.
GID00077231	Try and reason with him, see what happens. He's so lost in his technology, I don't think he even understands why anymore.
GID00077232	So come on and get me, jackass. I'll have this floor's security dissect you like an Auto-Doc.
GID00077233	So come on and get me, bitch. I'll have this floor's security dissect you like an Auto-Doc.
GID00077234	Leaving me in that goddamn elevator in the dark? You'll beg me to do the same to you while the Holograms are tracing lasers across your face.
GID00077235	[Christine motions to you, points at the door uneasily, then makes a pulling motion with her hand. She seems hesitant to go near it.]
GID00077236	All doors are locked down, security's activated - and emitter signals are lighting up all over this floor. I'll do what I can from here.
GID00077237	You'd think it was Spring the way tourists keep rolling in.
GID00077238	That one's got a head on their shoulders. For now.
GID00077239	Hope that tourist is hurrying, haven't got all day.
GID00077240	At least this one seems like a straight shooter. Or sucker.
GID00077241	That tourist crosses me, they'll regret it. Even if they don't, they still might.
GID00077242	Should never have set that radio signal on repeat.
GID00077243	There's a picture, a bunch of headless saps all waiting for the pearly gates. Whoever did this... messed up.
GID00077244	Oh, looks like you already forced the gate. Now, everybody and their mother can walk right in, thanks.
GID00077245	What are we doing in here? Planning to toss me in a cell?
GID00077246	Going to be sad to leave the Residential District. Well... not really.
GID00077247	Sure left a lot of traps around. Sometimes I forget where they are.
GID00077248	As worse as the other places are? This section of town is the most dangerous.
GID00077249	We need to get out of here - come alone if you want, don't drag me here.
GID00077250	Hear there's a belltower and church to the North... filled with Ghost People.
GID00077251	The cafe survived? How about that. Had great coffee - and one of the waitresses? Rhonda? Piece. Of. Work.
GID00077252	Do not leave me here.
GID00077253	Never liked the Chief here, real stickler for "policy."
GID00077254	Made off with a lot of mines, shotguns, and explosives from here... wasn't easy with the Ghost People around.
GID00077255	Got a worse grease smell down here than Danny Parker's hair on Opening Night.
GID00077256	What are we doing here for? This place is... well, it's haunted.
GID00077257	Seriously, we should get out of here. The Security Holograms... shoot on sight, and you can't even hurt them.
GID00077258	Salida del Sol - "Sunrise." Not much to look at now.
GID00077259	You sure came a long way to rob this place. Guess greed is in the blood.
GID00077260	Breath of fresh air in here... literally. If you need to take a breather from the Cloud, this is a good spot.
GID00077261	Might be a nice place to hole up for a while.
GID00077262	Check the fountains, might have some wishes... er, chips we can snag.
GID00077263	Watch the ground for bear traps and any openings for tripwires.
GID00077264	Ghost People.
GID00077265	If I ever had to come here, I stuck to the overhangs and roofs - like sidewalks up there.
GID00077266	Like a toxic ashtray down here.
GID00077267	Find a way to get this place hopping again... would clean all the toxic gas out of Puesta del Sol.
GID00077268	Stinks down here. And I can barely smell anything.
GID00077269	Sure glad one of us knows what you're doing.
GID00077270	You know, this used to be a nice town. Well, nice enough.
GID00077271	When in doubt, step quiet - and watch where you step.
GID00077272	Where there's a bear trap, Ghost People aren't far behind.
GID00077273	Watch out if you see a prize lying around - the Ghost People leave "supplies" as traps.
GID00077274	Getting real tired of tourist season - no offense, but you guys are lowering the bar.
GID00077275	Cloud wasn't always here. Grew over the years, even without cars or factories.
GID00077276	Sierra Madre may wait. Not me.
GID00077277	Sierra Madre's not getting any younger.
GID00077278	What's next?
GID00077279	Might be a bit rude, but that chair you're sitting in - it's got a shaped charge in the seat cushion.
GID00077280	[SUCCEEDED] Sounds like you've done some blue collar construction work in your life, your Ma must be proud. Still...
GID00077281	[FAILED] "Butt" is right. That heart-shaped charge in the stuffing will cause just the right amount of bleeding.
GID00077282	Great, a moron - just what I need. Look? That seat you're sitting in? It's a bomb. Go boom.
GID00077283	Get up without my permission, I'll blast your ass so far through your head, it'll turn the moon cherry pie red.
GID00077284	So - let's keep this sweet and polite, and finish our conversation with no misunderstandings.
GID00077285	Just because I work in entertainment, doesn't mean I'm a moron.
GID00077286	I heard my necktie beeping, I know what that means - I'm part of this somehow. I want out of this contract.
GID00077287	And if you put me in it, I'm not going to be too happy. So whatever's going on here, if you're part of all this? You're taking orders from me.
GID00077288	I'm not an idiot. I know the reason I'm in here now is because of the old guy - and you.
GID00077289	And you're wearing a collar, so I trust you a little more than the old guy. He's more controlling than I'd like.
GID00077290	Thing is, here's where being my partner pays off. See, I know how to get into the casino vault.
GID00077291	So here's the short of it - piece together Little Miss Vera Keyes' song in the right order? Sierra Madre opens its legs, we're in business.
GID00077292	[SUCCEEDED] And that's what I've missed - a rapt audience.
GID00077293	[FAILED] You don't listen too good, do you? Makes me think whatever you have to say isn't worth my time.
GID00077294	Oh, of course you do. Now, it's like we're married with these big wedding rings around our necks.
GID00077295	So why don't you hear my proposal first, before you start talking about what you need.
GID00077296	Christ, if that collar blows, I don't know if you'd know the difference, you'd probably still keep walking around with that dumb, blank look.
GID00077297	Just because I work in entertainment, doesn't mean I'm a moron.
GID00077298	Good, good - then we're in business. I may be a betting man, but I like it when the odds are in our favor.
GID00077299	If you're here with who I think, then I'd rather have you on my side than his. An... ace in the hole.
GID00077300	You want to live, I want what's in the Madre. Real simple.
GID00077301	That so?
GID00077302	Tried talking to them, bribing them, leaving food - nothing. In the years since, they haven't changed their approach, but I sure have.
GID00077303	They catch you, they drag you into the Cloud, and you're not coming back out. After that, having your necktie go off would be mercy.
GID00077304	My advice? Stay out of their way, they don't die easy.
GID00077305	That's an interesting clause. That's a real bad contract you have. We have.
GID00077306	[SUCCEEDED] What are you talking about?
GID00077307	[FAILED] The hand's been dealt, that's the deal. You going along with my terms, or do you want your brains to be wallpaper?
GID00077308	Just like all the rest. Strolling in here, thinking you own the place. I've been here longer than any of you tourists.
GID00077309	Trust me, I'm letting you off easier than the Sierra Madre ever would. Nobody's going to miss you... whoever you are, you're old news.
GID00077310	All right, all right... looks like marriage finally caught me.
GID00077311	I'm listening... partner. What's next, if we're death-til-we-part?
GID00077312	Not leaving me much choice. The Fountain, huh? Hope the Hologram's still working and the battery's running strong.
GID00077313	I'll follow you, I'm not going alone, trust me. Not like I'm a coward or anything, I'm not running around town without an escort.
GID00077314	I'm serious. One of the locals catches us, we aren't coming back - and I'd like to keep an eye on you.
GID00077315	You shoot them, they get back up. You stab them, they get back up.
GID00077316	That's why I have explosives all over this place - unless you blow them up, chop them up, disintegrate 'em, the Ghost People don't go down.
GID00077317	Not enough bullets in the town to spend on them. So unless you're a real good shot, save one for yourself right before they catch you.
GID00077318	[SUCCEEDED] Well... you seem like you know how to handle yourself. All right.
GID00077319	Once, I fired a lucky shot, hit a gas tank one was holding. Blew his arm off at the shoulder... and he didn't get back up after that.
GID00077320	So if you're that good, don't aim for the head - aim for their bombs. And if you can wait until his buddies are close by, even better.
GID00077321	[FAILED] Yeah, well, "probably" is something a gambler says, not a survivor. I'd keep your pistol where it belongs - in the holster.
GID00077322	Friend... "there's more mysteries in heaven and earth..." wait, no, "there is more between heaven and earth..." oh, forget it.
GID00077323	I'd sooner ask what makes me an undying son of a bitch than spend any thought as to why they crawled to life here.
GID00077324	I'm counting myself lucky I still have my faculties - they sure don't. Then again, they may not have had the... focus I do.
GID00077325	Wait, wait... wait just a minute. I'm not walking out there on my own.
GID00077326	Always had the Sierra Madre to keep my mind occupied.
GID00077327	Most folks, they don't have the same drive, the same need. Not worth my time. Pretty much Ghost People before the Bomb, now Ghost People after.
GID00077328	I know what's out there. It's why I've planted a mine field, shotguns, and explosives all the way on the road to my little boudoir here.
GID00077329	So we go together, or we're not going at all. I'll split my hand in Blackjack when the time's right, I'm not splitting up in this town, trust me.
GID00077330	All right... partner.
GID00077331	All right, all right... but you already got company, so tell you what - I'll meet you at the Fountain.
GID00077332	That's... a good point. All right, let me grab some smokes, and I'll meet you at the Fountain.
GID00077333	All right, keep it short, we don't have a lot of time.
GID00077334	Of course you do. Let's hear 'em.
GID00077335	It's your time, and if you want to spend it chatting, not much I can do about it.
GID00077336	Whatever we do - don't rile them up. Normally, there's only a few, maybe a pack. There's more out there, a lot more.
GID00077337	If they find out someone's trespassing, it'd be shaking a hornet's nest. Don't want to think how many of them could fill these streets.
GID00077338	Yeah, well, machines like those weren't unusual before the Bomb. Maybe to you, they're amazing, to me, they're grifters without the personality.
GID00077339	Sinclair made sure if you spent money here, it went one direction - although that's not how he described it.
GID00077340	Called it "self-sufficient." Like he was doing the residents a favor. Right.
GID00077341	If it's an emergency, you can get chems for any... uh... condition. Sinclair left that for doctors and trained professionals, not the common folk.
GID00077342	Even security and maintenance could get special supplies out of them. Staff had codes on little cards they could use to unlock them.
GID00077343	Around. Don't have much use for them myself, not worth the risk to get them.
GID00077344	I got all the basics covered, as long as I have the chips to pay for them. I don't need much.
GID00077345	There's a private elevator, Sinclair's elevator. It's up in the Executive Suites, in Vera's room. Not a coincidence.
GID00077346	Vera. She was... my other partner, before the Bomb. Took some legwork. Some convincing, made it happen.
GID00077347	Elevator's up in the Executive Suites. Voice-activated. Speak the right phrase, in the right tone of voice, and it's open sesame.
GID00077348	I was able to snag the voice, or thought I had. The right tone and phrasing... well, that may take some time.
GID00077349	Yeah, the woman, the Starlet, Vera - her voice. Didn't realize there was so many holotapes of her still around, otherwise... eh, never mind.
GID00077350	No, that I still had to figure out - still do. Sinclair wrote stuff down, was obsessive about it. Just got to find where.
GID00077351	Go knock yourself out. I'm just going to catch my breath a bit. That performance... well, more pressure than I was expecting.
GID00077352	Sinclair was already puppy-eyed, so all I had to do was the introductions. She smiled, fluttered her eyes, showed a little leg...
GID00077353	...and he built this whole place for her. Made her the key to his vault, like a joke, cause of her name. Her fake Hollywood name.
GID00077354	Except Sinclair didn't know I'd been there first. I could twist her whatever direction I wanted.
GID00077355	All she had to do was get inside the Sierra Madre for the Gala, then use her voice to open the door. After that... smooth sailing.
GID00077356	Would have been the biggest heist in history. Sinclair left holding the bag. Ruined.
GID00077357	The Bomb. Vera got sealed in here. A few hundred years go by, give-or-take. Almost the end of the story - then you came along.
GID00077358	Now we finish the job. Rob the Sierra Madre, rip out its heart. Last chapter of Frederick Sinclair, close the book.
GID00077359	Problem? All high-and-mighty. Lording it over everyone. Acting so self-righteous, like nothing could touch him. He was the one with the problem.
GID00077360	Never got mad at anything. Nothing seemed to shake him. Even after... his life kept getting dragged through the dirt.
GID00077361	Always kept looking for the bright, shining future in everything. So... I decided to take everything from him.
GID00077362	Do to me? What, weren't you listening? He thought he was better than me. Don't believe me? Look around.
GID00077363	This big casino, this big colossal monument - think it was for some woman? No, all ego, all self-righteous-in-lights, fit him perfect.
GID00077364	Had to take him down a few pegs, bring him down to my level. "Begin again?" Some things you don't get up from... I was going to prove it.
GID00077365	I only saw her yesterday. Well, a few yesterdays.
GID00077366	I didn't know at first. Then the old man showed up. You showed up. Then... that woman showed up, covered in scars.
GID00077367	The one who makes all the hand signs, a little tight around the corners of her mouth.
GID00077368	I put her in the Clinic, tuned her like an instrument. If she heals up, it's not going to be her voice speaking any more.
GID00077369	That is, if the Sierra Madre didn't get her. If it did... well, there's enough of Vera around for me to spend a few years piecing a book together.
GID00077370	Then she can make some beautiful music. I'm not banking on it.
GID00077371	No... you're not the type, but accidents happen, good intentions or no.
GID00077372	Really? That wasn't the "we're both bomb-married" talk you gave me when we first met.
GID00077373	Look, you could offer me a steel clad contract for a world tour of all major cities with Imperial Records, I still wouldn't stay here.
GID00077374	Sure, nice words, nice promises... not worth a dime out here in the shadow of the Sierra Madre.
GID00077375	You say you wouldn't leave me here, I know better. And you leave me here, this Gala Event isn't going to happen, I can feel it.
GID00077376	Holy Mary, Mother, and Joe - now there's a show.
GID00077377	Not much time to get to the gates before they shut the door and turn folks away.
GID00077378	All right, now - I'm out of here.
GID00077379	If the Ghost People didn't know we were here before, they know now.
GID00077380	Someone struck up the band. A band of tortured cats.
GID00077381	What kind of casino has two Grand Openings?
GID00077382	This is your last hurrah, Sinclair, I promise you.
GID00077383	Just my luck.
GID00077384	Luck's finally shining down on me.
GID00077385	You wait, beautiful. Keep that gate open for me, Dean'll be there soon.
GID00077386	Sierra Madre, sweetheart, Dean's coming home.
GID00077387	We'll see who's holding the cards in the end...
GID00077388	Didn't come all this way to get conned by some tourist.
GID00077389	The joke's on you, "partners." You aren't getting to the prize without me.
GID00077390	This is a fine how do you do.
GID00077391	Should have blown up that seat cushion right when they sat down, would've been a better end than this.
GID00077392	Just finish the last job, Dean. It's all you've wanted, just hang in there.
GID00077393	Keep your head down, Dean, don't let the locals see you.
GID00077394	Town's going to be filled with Ghosts when the sky lights up.
GID00077395	Sinclair, you better appreciate all I do to screw you over.
GID00077396	That tourist is better than most. Eh... probably won't matter.
GID00077397	The linked collars is a new trick. Can't say I like it much.
GID00077398	Waiting for the fireworks. Just like last time.
GID00077399	Can't wait to see their faces when they find out what the lock is. Just gotta wait 'em out.
GID00077400	Place is going to be swarming with the masks when the sky lights up.
GID00077401	Don't have to take the long way back - there's a shortcut across the way, you see.
GID00077402	It's through the Cloud - but if I'm with you, I can help you through it. If you didn't already force the lock to the gate, that is.
GID00077403	Have a seat - came all this way, least I can do is let you rest your feet for a second.
GID00077404	Just sit there on my little casting couch - more a chair, really, but I prefer up-and-comers to relax when I interview them.
GID00077405	You're my guest. If you're going to be rude, you can show yourself out. Probably won't tap-dance no more when you leave, but that's on you.
GID00077406	You standing there is making me nervous. Sit down, will you?
GID00077407	Have a seat.
GID00077408	Hey... guess who finally showed. You weren't on the guest list. Guess I'll need to call security, have them show you the door.
GID00077409	You... partner, are you a sight for sore eyes. Unfriendly crowd tonight, in a lethal way - if you could calm the house down, I'd be grateful.
GID00077410	Now, now... that's my room. You want your own dressing room, you have to work for it.
GID00077411	What the blazes... piece of junk! You rigged that terminal, didn't you. Didn't want security showing you out, eh? We'll see.
GID00077412	So... can't leave well enough alone, have to enter Vera's room. Some things are better left in the past, "partner."
GID00077413	Don't do it. Leave that projector alone - I'm warning you.
GID00077414	So... you think you have what it takes to beat me, on my stage, in my town? Come on down, we'll see.
GID00077415	Hey, you found my old room. I mean, it's a little small... and hey, watch the hands in there, I remember where I left everything, got it?
GID00077416	Hnh. Maybe I can shut down these ghosts using the Stage Manager's old termin... dammit! Well, so much for that idea.
GID00077417	Hey, you're making real progress, good. Uh, look that's... Vera's room, so careful what you touch in there, be respectful.
GID00077418	All right, now calm the audience down and let's go home. And when my part plays, no cracking jokes - that was the hairstyle back then, all right?
GID00077419	Oh, man... nice job. Good thing I was distracting them while you flicked them off. We're a good team - I run the show while you run the box office.
GID00077420	Hurry, would you? Get me out of this mess. Got to sue my agent for this.
GID00077421	Get me out of here, they've got me trapped!
GID00077422	Hold it together, Dean, you've been in worse jams. Like Madrid. Christ - Madrid.
GID00077423	How long you think you can keep dancing around out there? Song's going to end soon, you along with it.
GID00077424	You won't get out of here alive. Even if you reach me, you don't have the guts to fight.
GID00077425	I'm calling the tune here - this is my theater, my show, I've waited my life to get back here. You? Not even worth the time it'd take to kill you.
GID00077426	I am out of here... well, not to the Villa, just out of the damn theater first chance I get.
GID00077427	Got to say this for Sinclair, he sure knew how to keep things locked down, the tight-assed prick.
GID00077428	Not going to be performing here again, that's for sure.
GID00077429	Hnh. Theater's almost the same as it was.
GID00077430	This place... hasn't changed at all.
GID00077431	Wonder what happened to the suckers. Might have gotten taken away, like I did?
GID00077432	That audience... better lay low, get a feel for the crowd.
GID00077433	Good thing, someone walks in here, they're toast.
GID00077434	First time on stage in a hundred years, and it has to be this?
GID00077435	Hnh. Theater's almost the same as it was.
GID00077436	Where the hell did everyone else go?
GID00077437	Need some help here... and that audience is not looking friendly.
GID00077438	Hope my partner fared better than I did... better not have left me high and dry, get-even's not going to be pretty.
GID00077439	So... what's your story, beautiful?
GID00077440	[Christine studies Dean, frowns.]
GID00077441	Don't... uh... don't talk much, do you?
GID00077442	[Christine shakes her head slowly.]
GID00077443	All right, then. I'll just wallflower it over here.
GID00077444	Eh... those scars? What happened, somebody... something carve you up, or...?
GID00077445	[Christine frowns, tilts her head slightly.]
GID00077446	Damn shame, hate to think if someone put you in there. Who bailed you out again, the new guy? Interesting.
GID00077447	Look, you obviously hear good - even if you aren't much of a talker.
GID00077448	[Christine's eyes narrow.]
GID00077449	Don't get me wrong, that's a plus in my book.
GID00077450	[Christine eyes narrow to slits.]
GID00077451	Still, are you getting any shred of your voice healed up, or...? Like anything?
GID00077452	Look, you obviously hear good - even if you aren't much of a talker.
GID00077453	Where the hell did you get this one. "Dog?" What, so you don't forget your name?
GID00077454	I don't remember you. Who are you.
GID00077455	A little slow, huh? Uh... Dean. Dean Domino. I... live here.
GID00077456	You look like food, smell like food. Dog - hungry.
GID00077457	All right, pal, you stay in your corner, I'll stay in mine. Do not leave me alone with this thing.
GID00077458	Why are you so carved up - that a bear trap on your arm?
GID00077459	Reminds me, keeps the voice out of my head. He can't talk when the pain's howling at me.
GID00077460	Eh... wait, so you're not just slow, you're screwy, too? Some crew we are... we are never getting into the Sierra Madre.
GID00077461	Dog is hungry. Tired of your voice... when do we eat?
GID00077462	Don't like the way this guy is looking at me. You better be his leash.
GID00077463	Stop looking at me, you idiot. I can hear your stomach growling from here, I don't like it.
GID00077464	Run from Dog? Dog knows how to hunt. Dog will find you, tear you apart.
GID00077465	That a bet you want to take? Cause I'll see that and raise you a few bullets to the skull.
GID00077466	Dog's been shot before, many times. Won't stop me from catching you.
GID00077467	I hope you've got this one under control, because he's giving me a nasty itch on my trigger finger.
GID00077468	Dog, back in the cage.
GID00077469	People missing heads... make mistake coming here. Make Dog hungry.
GID00077470	It looks like someone was experimenting... although they were doing so after the collars went off.
GID00077471	Really dark down here. Smell like oil and 'tronics.
GID00077472	Dog not like this place. Air smells like burnt sparks and blood.
GID00077473	Cafe. Food place. Maybe something in kitchen?
GID00077474	Like it here.
GID00077475	When Dog catch a Ghost in plastic, Dog tear him apart so they don't get back up.
GID00077476	Smells like... flesh in plastic... lots of food around here. We should catch some.
GID00077477	Lots of marks on walls from other dead people. They not get far.
GID00077478	Hope the voice doesn't come back. Mean. Bad.
GID00077479	Where is Master? Did he go away? Dog will be good this time.
GID00077480	Swallowed something bad. Taste like burnt wires.
GID00077481	Always yell at Dog. Yell at Dog because gets hungry, can't stop it... always need more.
GID00077482	Insides growling.
GID00077483	So hungry.
GID00077484	Don't like this place. Want to go back, back to the Base. Or the Church, miss the Church.
GID00077485	Air in here not burn chest.
GID00077486	:: Mournful whining to self ::
GID00077487	:: Stomach rumbling.::
GID00077488	Knew you would come, below the cage... down to where I am. Maybe you saw the letters I scratched on the Villa walls.
GID00077489	A little farther. Follow my voice... that's it. The one in the cage? Dog. I had to lock him up. He keeps... disobeying me.
GID00077490	That's me, there, on the table. The disk. My voice.
GID00077491	Can't take any chances, though... you may be some victim who simply stumbled down here. If so, can't let you let Dog out... no, not yet.
GID00077492	If you're who I think you are, you came to fetch Dog, use him to drag others here. Now I'll use you - and that Pip-Boy you're wearing.
GID00077493	You're smart. Clever. The key to Dog's cage is simple. Take my voice to the cage above. Let me speak to the beast inside.
GID00077494	Then you and I... we can talk.
GID00077495	What have we here? You weren't who I was expecting. I'm disappointed.
GID00077496	Still... even if you aren't my intended guest, you take direction. Good. You can't have been an idiot to figure out how to release me from my cage...
GID00077497	...or perhaps you are, with that leash on your arm and the one around your neck... with our collars and manacles, why, we may as well be kin.
GID00077498	I'm the voice of reason. I sleep sometimes... down in the basement, in the cage. Now that I'm awake, Dog goes back in the cage.
GID00077499	Dog knows I'm here, but can't do anything about it. I'm his... conscience. Keep him tame, keep him from hurting us... doing foolish things.
GID00077500	The carving's a reminder, for mirrors and for Dog. Dog, who you heard coming in, howling and hungry, as always.
GID00077501	You're good at fetching... this should keep him where he belongs. For now. I'll wait... send the signal, we'll be ready.
GID00077502	Then nothing's going to keep me here... we need bait, or the beast is going to wake up, and you'll never see the Sierra Madre.
GID00077503	Locked myself in. Could feel myself... letting go. Dog's howling getting louder. It happens when he's hungry and no one's around to tell him... no.
GID00077504	I've been trapped in here for some time, then you come along and let me out. So... you opened my cage for a reason. Now... I want to know why.
GID00077505	Of course you do. And so do I.
GID00077506	Dog and I take turns in the cage... one steps out, the other goes back in. Now - what do you want?
GID00077507	Do you see these wounds of his, covering his skin...the bear trap on his arm? He placed his own hand in it.
GID00077508	The name he carved in his chest? To remind him of who he is, he inflicts pain on himself to silence me, when all I try to do... Hrr!
GID00077509	...he cuts, hurts, and tries to murder me out of him. He won't succeed. Just makes me angrier.
GID00077510	Dog is the beast, we simply change cages. Like the ones here.
GID00077511	...hrnnn... will kill us both unless you do something. Never felt him so strong before, he won't listen to my voice. He's... he's...
GID00077512	...hungry. Come here, or Dog will chase you, break you until you no run anymore.
GID00077513	...hrnnn... listen to you... can't hold him back much longer... tell him... to pull on his chain, as hard as...
GID00077514	...Dog can. What Master wants, Dog can do. Please don't be mad with Dog...
GID00077515	...live anymore. Sick of being inside, sick of hearing his stomach screaming at me, and...
GID00077516	...Dog is tired... Dog tired of fighting, being here... Tired of you keeping Dog caged here.
GID00077517	...both of us are. Tell him to listen to me. Then we can get out of this... finally... and...
GID00077518	...now Dog is listening to voice, your voice only.
GID00077519	Uh-huh.
GID00077520	Nnn-nnn.
GID00077521	Yes, Master.
GID00077522	Very well... lead on.
GID00077523	You already have someone in your shadow... I'll meet you at the Villa Fountain.
GID00077524	Very well... to the Fountain and its ghost, then.
GID00077525	Maybe Dog will obey you. I'm not as easily broken.
GID00077526	I'm sure you do.
GID00077527	Nooooooooooo!
GID00077528	:: Howling, frightened. ::
GID00077529	Let me out, let me out!
GID00077530	Noise hurts, noise hurts!
GID00077531	Streets are hurting my ears!
GID00077532	Too bright, too bright.
GID00077533	Lights and fire.
GID00077534	Pretty.
GID00077535	Lots of noise.
GID00077536	Where is Master? Did Master make fires in the sky?
GID00077537	:: Delighted clapping ::
GID00077538	:: Weeping. ::
GID00077539	:: Whimpering ::
GID00077540	:: Howling in frustration ::
GID00077541	Please let me out.
GID00077542	Dog is sorry, sorry, sorry.
GID00077543	What did I do?
GID00077544	Where are lights. Dog want to see the lights.
GID00077545	Can't wait to see the lights.
GID00077546	:: Impatient Growl ::
GID00077547	Hurry up, Dog doesn't like being here.
GID00077548	Got to go... Casin-oooo.
GID00077549	Didn't... we do this before? Can't remember.
GID00077550	Want show and lights and yelling to start.
GID00077551	Get away while you can, before he comes back.
GID00077552	Makes Dog hurt self.
GID00077553	Master, help me, Master, help me. Please.
GID00077554	Don't let him make me hurt myself. Hurt keeps him away.
GID00077555	So hungry.
GID00077556	I'll be good this time, I promise, Master, just keep him away.
GID00077557	Noise makes my stomach hurt.
GID00077558	Turn the noise off.
GID00077559	Puts Dog in the cage, hiding downstairs.
GID00077560	He's watching, waiting for you to try and let me go.
GID00077561	So hungry.
GID00077562	...going to make casino burn, no more being...
GID00077563	...back in the cage. Stop what you're doing, we can...
GID00077564	...can hear you now. Not much longer, not...
GID00077565	...listening to me. Tired of being your minder, tired...
GID00077566	...of putting Dog to sleep, he wakes up in cage, hungry, Dog wants...
GID00077567	...to protect you, always wanted to protect you, the reason I have to take control is...
GID00077568	...Master. Master set me free, Dog needs to...
GID00077569	...listen to me. If you do this, we both...
GID00077570	...die. Dog wants to die. Don't care anymore, tired of you, tired of place. Master will...
GID00077571	...help us. Please let me help us. If you don't, then you're...
GID00077572	Something... wrong in the air.
GID00077573	All fire now. Burn away voice, leave Dog in peace.
GID00077574	No! Dog, get back in the c-
GID00077575	Why pipe not break. Pipe. Break. Hnh. Leave it, not important.
GID00077576	Pipe stay broken.
GID00077577	Pipe needs to behave, or Dog will hurt pipe.
GID00077578	All better. Pipe be good now, keep hissing.
GID00077579	Are you listening? From now on, when I talk to you, pay attention.
GID00077580	I've left markers on your Pip-Boy - find the three other collars in town - 8, 12, and 14, get them to the Fountain. Obey me, and you can all go free.
GID00077581	Do I? For what? Your greed? Curiosity? You came here on your own, no one held a gun to your head.
GID00077582	I've seen your Pip-Boy archives, your map markers and notes - you picked up the Sierra Madre signal just as I did, you couldn't resist.
GID00077583	So if you feel I have a lot to answer for... no, the blame isn't on my shoulders. Might as well have put the collar on yourself.
GID00077584	Hiding? Hardly. Trapped.
GID00077585	You think you were the first one to unlock the casino door? No, I did it... with other hands, other bodies. After that, the casino wouldn't let go.
GID00077586	Once I was locked in, no way out... until your Pip-Boy signal came to life in the Villa. Then... then, uh, things changed. And here you are.
GID00077587	You speak as if your fingers have never touched the keys of a RobCo terminal. No machine is foolproof, they are designed to obey us.
GID00077588	The Pip-Boy's operating system has vulnerabilities... advantages to those who've studied its construction, even superficially.
GID00077589	It's just a machine, though. Its real vulnerability is who wears it. And that's how you were caught.
GID00077590	That thing on your wrist - it's a convenience. It tells you where to go, what to do, dulls your brain.
GID00077591	It may have helped you find the Sierra Madre broadcast, but it's just as much a crutch today as it was in the Old World.
GID00077592	Proud that you have one? I can hear the superiority.
GID00077593	Can't believe the idiot swallowed his collar.
GID00077594	What's taking that human so long.
GID00077595	If that human wasn't wearing a collar...
GID00077596	Wonder what that human's insides would look like laid out over the fountain.
GID00077597	Might be able to rip the Pip-Boy off his arm without killing him. Hmm.
GID00077598	No toxins in the air in here.
GID00077599	Well, this place has seen better days.
GID00077600	If we need to fight, you should call Dog out... as much as I hate to admit it.
GID00077601	Might be able to use the gas valves around here to set traps of our own.
GID00077602	We'll need to move faster than this if we're going to outwit the Old Man.
GID00077603	Happy you followed the Sierra Madre broadcast? Curiosity and greed, same thing.
GID00077604	It's your own fault you're here. Couldn't leave well enough alone.
GID00077605	That Pip-Boy... maybe I'll tear it off your arm, wear it on my neck.
GID00077606	Air tastes like copper. Or Old World gold.
GID00077607	Almost got away... then the idiot's hunger screws it up.
GID00077608	Why do you keep looking at your Pip-Boy? It won't help. Didn't help the Old Man.
GID00077609	Can't believe the idiot swallowed his collar.
GID00077610	The human did it. Good.
GID00077611	Not going down like last time - Dog, you're staying in the cage.
GID00077612	Time to get to the gate, "friends" or no friends.
GID00077613	Fires and speakers are going to bring the Ghost People out in full.
GID00077614	Coming for you, human... you just wait.
GID00077615	Madre's mine.
GID00077616	Hnh. The human pulled it off.
GID00077617	Just like last time. Come on, Dog, you know the drill.
GID00077618	Gate won't be open for long.
GID00077619	Need to stay out of sight... can't afford to be distracted now.
GID00077620	What the Old World saw in these light shows is beyond me.
GID00077621	When this festival fires, I'm the first one in the door.
GID00077622	Last time I ever deal with human trash...
GID00077623	After the Bomb, still slaves to technology, events, Pip-Boys, collars... hnnnr.
GID00077624	I'll whip you for this, Dog. I'll crush your cage with you inside it for making me go through this.
GID00077625	All this - if I get inside the Sierra Madre, it's all worth it. All of it.
GID00077626	As soon as those collars go off... we'll settle things, yes.
GID00077627	Hurry, we're targets out here.
GID00077628	Almost inside. Finally. Then I can get rid of the baggage.
GID00077629	Quiet, Dog, stay in the cage.
GID00077630	Sick of these Old World deathtraps.
GID00077631	The Sierra Madre's almost mine.
GID00077632	They better not try and leave me here...
GID00077633	What's this? Why... it's a little doll. Were you carved by a craftsman, or mauled by a drunk who didn't know his tools?
GID00077634	[Christine narrows her eyes, gets into a combat stance.]
GID00077635	I'm not going to hurt you... yet. Much. Scars tell a story, some old, some new... and the one on the throat is fresh and red.
GID00077636	Someone wanted to cut your voice, little doll. Or they didn't finish their work, or didn't know how to.
GID00077637	[Christine frowns.]
GID00077638	Oh, it wasn't me... I have no use for your neck beyond what encircles it. The lack of screams when I finally kill you... that is what I'll regret.
GID00077639	Touched by radiation, and you choose to spend your time here. You could have just left... but you're too obsessed to let go.
GID00077640	I used to know a ventriloquist with more skill than you. At least he had the sense to know his own name, without carving it into his chest.
GID00077641	Mirrors tell me my name when needed... and I have a name for you, several. Thief, coward... showman. Radiation couldn't kill the truth, could it.
GID00077642	The truth, buddy, is this: you and me, we're now family as long as we got these bowties on. So watch your mouth, you don't scare me.
GID00077643	You could have left the Sierra Madre. Left this Villa, joined your own kind.
GID00077644	Sierra Madre's mine, my heart's right where it belongs.
GID00077645	You can't abide it. There's no heart. You hate it, I can hear it in your words.
GID00077646	Sounds like you need your hearing checked. Sierra Madre, it's meant for me.
GID00077647	It's letting go.
GID00077648	You've heard of the Sierra Madre Casino.
GID00077649	We all have, the legend, the curses.
GID00077650	Foolishness about it lying in the middle of the City of the Dead, buried beneath a blood-red cloud.
GID00077651	A bright, shining monument luring treasure hunters to their doom.
GID00077652	It was built before the War, a tower of gold and lights, where fortunes could be gained and lost...
GID00077653	... a monument to wealth.
GID00077655	[Christine narrows her eyes, gets into a combat stance.]
GID00077656	I'm not going to hurt you... yet. Much. Scars tell a story, some old, some new... and the one on the throat is fresh and red.
GID00077657	[Christine studies Dean, frowns.]
GID00077658	Don't... eh... don't talk much, do you?
GID00077659	[Christine shakes her head slowly.]
GID00077660	All right, then. I'll just wallflower it over here.
GID00077661	[Christine frowns, tilts her head slightly.]
GID00077662	Damn shame, hate to think if someone put you in there. Who bailed you out again, the new guy? Interesting.
GID00077663	What's this little doll? Were you carved by a craftsman, little doll, or were you mauled by a drunk who didn't know his tools?
GID00077664	So... what's your story, beautiful?
GID00077665	Eh... those scars? What happened, somebody... something carve you up, or...?
GID00077667	[STATIC]
GID00077668	[Christine frowns.]
GID00077669	Oh, it wasn't me... I have no use for your neck beyond what encircles it. The lack of screams when I finally kill you... that is what I'll regret.
GID00077670	[Christine's eyes narrow.]
GID00077671	Don't get me wrong, that's a plus in my book.
GID00077672	[Christine eyes narrow to slits.]
GID00077673	Still, are you getting any shred of your voice healed up, or...? Like anything?
GID00077674	Someone wanted to cut your voice, little doll. Or they didn't finish their work, or didn't know how to.
GID00077679	[STATIC]
GID00077684	[STATIC]
GID00077685	I don't remember you. Who are you.
GID00077686	A little slow, huh? Uh... Dean. Dean Domino. I... live here.
GID00077687	You look like food, smell like food. Dog - hungry.
GID00077688	All right, pal, you stay in your corner, I'll stay in mine. Do not leave me alone with this thing.
GID00077689	Reminds me, keeps the voice out of my head. He can't talk when the pain's howling at me.
GID00077690	Wait, so you're not just slow, you're screwy, too? Some crew we are... we are never getting into the Sierra Madre.
GID00077691	Dog is hungry. Tired of your voice... when do we eat?
GID00077692	Don't like the way this guy is looking at me. You better be his leash.
GID00077693	Where the hell did you get this one. "Dog?" What, so you don't forget your name?
GID00077694	Why are you so carved up - that a bear trap on your arm?
GID00077695	You'd think it was Spring the way tourists keep rolling in.
GID00077696	That one's got a head on their shoulders. For now.
GID00077697	Hope that tourist is hurrying, haven't got all day.
GID00077698	At least this one seems like a straight shooter. Or sucker.
GID00077699	That tourist crosses me, they'll regret it. Even if they don't, they still might.
GID00077700	Should never have set that radio signal on repeat.
GID00077701	Run from Dog? Dog knows how to hunt. Dog will find you, tear you apart.
GID00077702	That a bet you want to take? Cause I'll see that and raise you a few bullets to the skull.
GID00077703	Dog's been shot before, many times. Won't stop me from catching you.
GID00077704	Hope you've got this one under control because he's giving me a nasty itch on my trigger finger.
GID00077705	Didn't come all this way to get conned by some tourist.
GID00077706	We'll see who's holding the cards in the end...
GID00077707	The joke's on you, "partners." You aren't getting to the prize without me.
GID00077708	This is a fine how do you do.
GID00077709	Should have blown up that seat cushion right when they sat down, would've been a better end than this.
GID00077710	Just finish the last job, Dean. It's all you've wanted, just hang in there.
GID00077711	Keep your head down, Dean, don't let the locals see you.
GID00077712	Sinclair, you better appreciate all I do to screw you over.
GID00077713	That tourist is better than most. Probably won't matter.
GID00077714	Town's going to be filled with Ghosts when the sky lights up.
GID00077715	The linked collars is a new trick. Can't say I like it much.
GID00077716	Waiting for the fireworks. Just like last time.
GID00077717	Can't wait to see their faces when they find out what the lock is. Just gotta wait 'em out.
GID00077718	Place is going to be swarming with the masks when the sky lights up.
GID00077719	Not much time to get to the gates before they shut the door and turn folks away.
GID00077720	Holy Mary, Mother, and Joe - now there's a show.
GID00077721	All right, now - I'm out of here.
GID00077722	If the Ghost People didn't know we were here before, they know now.
GID00077723	Someone struck up the band. A band of tortured cats.
GID00077724	What kind of casino has two Grand Openings?
GID00077725	This is your last hurrah, Sinclair, I promise you.
GID00077726	Just my luck.
GID00077727	Luck's finally shining down on me.
GID00077728	You wait, beautiful. Keep that gate open for me, Dean'll be there soon.
GID00077729	Sierra Madre, sweetheart, Dean's coming home.
GID00077730	Stop looking at me, you idiot. I can hear your stomach growling from here, I don't like it.
GID00077732	Got to say this for Sinclair, he sure knew how to keep things locked down, the tight-assed prick.
GID00077733	Where the hell did everyone else go?
GID00077734	Wonder what happened to the suckers. Might have gotten taken away, like I did? Hnh.
GID00077735	Hnh. Theater's almost the same as it was.
GID00077736	Not going to be performing here again, that's for sure.
GID00077737	First time on stage in a hundred years, and it has to be this?
GID00077738	Need some help here... and that audience is not looking friendly.
GID00077739	Hope my partner fared better than I did... better not have left me high and dry, get-even's not going to be pretty.
GID00077740	That audience... better lay low, get a feel for the crowd.
GID00077741	Good thing, someone walks in here, they're toast.
GID00077742	I am out of here... well, not to the Villa, just out of the damn theater first chance I get.
GID00077743	This place... hasn't changed at all.
GID00077744	Used to know a ventriloquist with more skill than you, at least he had the sense to know his own name without carving it into his chest.
GID00077745	Mirrors tell me my name when needed... and I have a name for you, several. Thief, coward... showman. Radiation couldn't kill the truth, could it.
GID00077746	The truth, buddy, is this: you and me, we're now family as long as we got these bowties on. So watch your mouth, you don't scare me.
GID00077747	Touched by radiation, and you choose to spend your time here. You could have just left... but you're too obsessed to let go.

GID00077755	Let me out, let me out!
GID00077756	So hungry.
GID00077757	Don't like this place. Want to go back, back to the base. Or the Church, miss the Church.
GID00077758	Insides growling.
GID00077759	:: Mournful whining to self ::
GID00077760	Hope the voice doesn't come back. Mean. Bad.
GID00077761	Where is Master? Did he go away? Dog will be good this time.
GID00077762	Swallowed something bad. Taste like burnt wires.
GID00077763	:: Stomach rumbling.::
GID00077764	Can't believe the idiot swallowed his collar.
GID00077765	What's taking that human so long.
GID00077766	If that human wasn't wearing a collar...
GID00077767	Wonder what that human's insides would look like laid out over the fountain.
GID00077768	Might be able to rip the Pip-Boy off his arm without killing him. Hmm.
GID00077769	Air tastes like copper. Or Old World gold.
GID00077770	Almost got away... then the idiot's hunger screws it up.
GID00077771	Quiet, Dog, stay in the cage.
GID00077772	Sierra Madre's mine, my heart's right where it belongs.

GID00077799	Too bright, too bright.
GID00077800	Hurry, we're targets out here.
GID00077801	Almost inside. Finally. Then I can get rid of the baggage.
GID00077802	Quiet, Dog, stay in the cage.

GID00077824	I... he's asleep. Finally. Shhhhhh.
GID00077825	Dog... all I wanted was for you to listen to me, let me care for you. Keep you from hurting yourself...
GID00077826	Now I can. And one day, when you're ready, I'll let you out. When you're calm, and we... understand each other.
GID00077827	And we're at peace, you and I, mind and instinct. Then the world will be ready for us.
GID00077828	Hello? Voice? You there? It's Dog......Dog can hear himself. Voice is... is in cage? Locked.
GID00077829	Now Dog speak. Now Dog not afraid. And... hungry. More hungry.
GID00077830	Dog find food... tear apart food, eat. Chase it down, can't run, feed. Finally, until Dog is full.
GID00077831	What is this place?
GID00077832	Feel strange, like... sleeping. On my neck, is this... a chain? I... what's carved on my chest.
GID00077833	"God." No... not God. Something in reverse... hnh. Was that one of them...?
GID00077834	Should rest, get my strength back... then explore this place, see what it holds.
GID00077835	...going to make casino burn, no more being...
GID00077836	...back in the cage. Stop what you're doing, we can...
GID00077837	...can hear you now. Not much longer, not...
GID00077838	...listening to me. Tired of being your minder, tired...
GID00077839	...of putting Dog to sleep, he wakes up in cage, hungry, Dog wants...
GID00077840	...to protect you, always wanted to protect you, the reason I have to take control is...
GID00077841	...Master. Master set me free, Dog needs to...
GID00077842	...listen to me. If you do this, we both...
GID00077843	...die. Dog wants to die. Don't care anymore, tired of you, tired of place. Master will...
GID00077844	...help us. Please let me help us. If you don't, then you're...
GID00077845	Hnh. The human pulled it off.
GID00077846	Just like last time. Come on, Dog, you know the drill.
GID00077847	What the Old World saw in these light shows is beyond me.
GID00077848	The human did it. Good.
GID00077849	Not going down like last time - Dog, you're staying in the cage.
GID00077850	Time to get to the gate, "friends" or no friends.
GID00077851	Fires and speakers are going to bring the Ghost People out in full.
GID00077852	Coming for you, human... you just wait.
GID00077853	Madre's mine.
GID00077854	So hungry.
GID00077855	Insides growling.
GID00077856	:: Mournful whining to self ::
GID00077857	Hope the voice doesn't come back. Mean. Bad.
GID00077858	:: Stomach rumbling.::
GID00077859	Need to stay out of sight... can't afford to be distracted now.
GID00077860	Still can't figure out why I lost the signals...
GID00077861	There's no reason why it could have gone wrong, had it all planned out... maybe it was the curse of the Sierra Madre.
GID00077862	Damn Cloud still in my lungs, rattling around.
GID00077864	Good thing I installed radios in the collars, Pip-Boy's letting me pick them up.
GID00077865	What the hell is 21 doing now... hnh.
GID00077866	Fool better not decide to sleep. Vitals go down, I'll get someone else to do this job.
GID00077867	Unnn... sitting too long. Damn arthritis.
GID00077868	Come too far to go back now. Too far.
GID00077869	Hnh. Going to wipe the slate clean. Kimball, the Republic... Hardin, McNamara, my "brothers." Then I'll head back West.
GID00077870	Better loop some instructions in case something happens.
GID00077871	Going to get inside this place if it's the last thing I do.
GID00077872	Running out of volunteers. Last ones couldn't see beyond their own greed.
GID00077873	If only people would do what I say, wouldn't need these damn collars to keep them in line. Keep going for each other's throats like dogs.
GID00077874	Wish I... still had that damn Holorifle. Spent forever making it... need to find it when this is all done.
GID00077875	What the hell was that?
GID00077876	The Gala Event... finally. Probably wake up half the things in town.
GID00077877	Power's fluctuating in here... getting some systems waking up, good, good.
GID00077878	Now all they have to do is just get here. Tired of waiting.
GID00077879	Hurry... hurry... you just need to get inside, I'll handle the rest. Come on, you fools.
GID00077880	Not far now... soon, the Sierra Madre's mine. Doors won't hold open forever... just like the last time. Come on.
GID00077881	All right, now everything's coming together...
GID00077882	Just need to keep their gears turning a little while longer...
GID00077883	Can't believe this old Pip-Boy saved me. Even if it led me to that damn signal in the first place.
GID00077884	Good thing the new recruit had a Pip-Boy, too, probably stole it from a Vault 21 dweller. Still, a thief's just what I need for this.
GID00077885	If only the others would've obeyed orders half as well as this one... should have thought of linking the collars together the first few times.
GID00077886	Good thing I can still hook into the Villa speakers by remote...
GID00077887	Damn Hologram tech. Worthless as security... better as weapons.
GID00077888	What the hell are they doing out there. Hurry up, you idiots, I don't have a few more years to waste.
GID00077889	Outwitted by doors. Hermetically sealed doors don't protect anyone, all they do is seal us in.
GID00077890	Why the owner tied all of this to the Gala Event, insanity... backwards thinking, having a festival be your key. No wonder the bombs fell.
GID00077891	Can you hear me? Signal should be stronger in here. I'll set this on loop... just in case I need to step away for a moment.
GID00077892	When the bombs hit, this casino sealed up like an Emperor's tomb. If you don't know what that means, never mind, it means we're trapped.
GID00077893	So - get the power running to the main floor. That'll open the elevators and unlock the doors.
GID00077894	The ones that didn't strip their gears when they locked into place, Old World junk. Shoddy workmanship.
GID00077895	Once the power's on, then I'll tell you your next steps. Just get this part done, and then listen.
GID00077896	If you're wondering where your crew is, well... the casino saw them as guests. Which means they all got assigned to their floor. Just like mine.
GID00077897	Don't worry about them, they're of no use if you can't get the power running.
GID00077898	All I need is you for the rest of this. Which means we just need to deal with them, one by one, and then the Vault's... ours.
GID00077899	Ha! You got the power on, excellent. You were quite a find, glad my trap in the desert caught you before time ran out.
GID00077900	And also glad you didn't come across this place first, might have plundered it first... can't have that. Like at HELIOS. And Hoover Dam.
GID00077901	All right, setting this on repeat in case you're some idiot-savant braincase and need the reminder...
GID00077902	So, my greedy friend, we've got some unfinished business. I'm not one to share, and there's loose ends we need to wrap up first.
GID00077903	The rest of your team is on different floors. They got assigned there, ushered there based on the casino's records as to the best "fit."
GID00077904	Don't ask me how, Pre-War casino security and escort systems aren't my specialty.
GID00077905	Go to each floor, and kill them. I don't need them anymore... well, now that you're here.
GID00077906	We don't need anyone... except each other. Together, we'll crack the Sierra Madre, and we can both leave this place behind.
GID00077907	Now... if anything about our little heist went smoothly, you'd go to the Vault... except it's locked by some code I'm not familiar with.
GID00077908	The door to the casino vault is hidden in the Executive Suites, without the means to unlock it, it's useless.
GID00077909	Find a way to open it, bypass the code, then we'll talk.
GID00077910	You did it... a voice lock. Why would he have done that? Uh! Never mind.
GID00077911	Now I just need you to go below, look around. See if there's any other surprises down there.
GID00077912	I'll be along once you've found the Vault. No need risking myself just yet.
GID00077913	End of line.
GID00077914	I... we... hope you've enjoyed your stay.
GID00077915	Farewells can be a time of sadness. Letting go... difficult. As a guest of the Sierra Madre, you know that truth more than anyone.
GID00077916	Frederick Sinclair believed one's life could be made anew every day, that fortunes were more than the wealth in your hands.
GID00077917	Love. Life... family, those to care for, and those who will care for you.
GID00077918	To those who know these joys, the Sierra Madre holds little they don't already have.
GID00077919	Out in the world, beyond these walls, that is your chance to begin again.
GID00077920	I hope you'll return, in happier times. Until then, the Sierra Madre... and I... will hold you in our hearts.
GID00077921	Guests, and residents of the Villa alike, I ask you to step outside and look to the night sky.
GID00077922	It's the moment you've been waiting for, the reason we're all here - the Gala Event, the Grand Opening of the Sierra Madre Casino.
GID00077923	You are the ones who have made this momentous occasion possible, and for that, we thank you.
GID00077924	So raise your glass in celebration - let music fill the streets, fireworks light the sky, and promise of new beginnings fill your hearts.
GID00077925	No matter what your fortunes, no matter what your cares, let go this night, and begin again.
GID00077926	I suggest you hurry, though - the gates of the Sierra Madre are open, but only for a brief time.
GID00077927	After that, the doors will close for the evening's festivities, and won't open again until morning.
GID00077928	Let's head through the hole in the wall there - if we go backstage, we avoid the locals.
GID00077929	[The Hologram makes a gesture, seems to be indicating amounts and figures.]
GID00077930	[The Hologram points at the table before you. As you set the chips down, the tabletop rotates, and with a whir, Pre-War bills slide out.]
GID00077931	[The Hologram nods, gives a stiff farewell wave.]
GID00077932	[You place the bill on the counter. A panel rotates, and the bill is replaced with a single Sierra Madre Chip.]
GID00077933	[You set the bills on the counter. A panel flips, there is a single whir, a click, then a panel rises up with a handful of Sierra Madre Chips.]
GID00077934	[You count out the bills on the counter. A panel flips, followed by slow, steady series of clicks, and a stack of chips rise up from the panel.]
GID00077935	[The Hologram waits.]
GID00077936	[Christine smiles slightly in relief, and nods. She opens her mouth slightly, then closes it, frustrated.]
GID00077937	[She points at you, then makes a fist and puts it against her chest and nods.]
GID00077938	[Christine smiles slightly in relief, and moves to the elevator.]
GID00077939	What did you just do... can't access the protocols. Didn't even think Elijah could break Madre security... hnh. Must be a Scribe, too.
GID00077940	Security's down...? Hnh. Doesn't matter, won't help you.
GID00077941	If it's who I think it is, this is Christine... recovered. In what looks like an Old World hotel room, high class, two rooms - exit's sealed.
GID00077942	Floor's got holographic security. Not latest tech, field of view targeting systems, primitive. Familiar.
GID00077943	Floor looks like it protected the guests too well. Checked the Suite, found the holographic woman from the Villa Fountain.
GID00077944	Picking up that interference frequency, same as the Villa, floor's live with speakers and radios. Keep an ear out, watch the walls.
GID00077945	Doors on this floor are all operated manually in an emergency, place is locked up tight. Must be keycards around somewhere.
GID00077946	Looks like security systems did more to kill the people here than the Bomb did. Hope there's a way out of this casino.
GID00077947	What's with my collar... Elijah? Or... no, it's you. Even better. This is Christine, voice back. You got off on the wrong floor, you're trapped.
GID00077948	Hope you can make it past security. I've been looking forward to taking care of you since the Gala Event.
GID00077949	You and Elijah were working together this whole time. Should've known, just from your actions, you have his... outlook on things.
GID00077950	Hope you aren't dead yet... although I'm sure my collar would let me know. I could just detonate it now, but saving it for someone special.
GID00077951	Time is against you. It always was.
GID00077952	Struggle all you want... the Sierra Madre will be your grave.
GID00077953	I'm not without weapons of my own... let me show you.
GID00077954	You came all this way... but you lost as soon as you arrived here.
GID00077955	Think you've won? You've won nothing.
GID00077956	You think you've outsmarted me? You can't get away. You're the one on a leash, you always were.
GID00077957	Pre-War tech... so easy to control, just like your Pip-Boy. Turrets, Holograms, they're all just toys.
GID00077958	Don't have time for this.
GID00077959	Aaah... Pre-War junk. I'll put you down myself.
GID00077960	Eh? What's this.
GID00077961	Alarms... what... you. Think you can run, think you can trick me?
GID00077962	This entire structure is mine to command. Security... weapons... all this technology - mine. Now - you die.
GID00077963	You think you've escaped... no. No, you were never out of reach... my hand was always around your neck.
GID00077964	Staying in the Vault? Think it'll protect you? No... I don't think so.
GID00077965	I'll have the Sierra Madre kill you for me. You can't beat all the casino's defenses... it's only a matter of time now.
GID00077966	Did you really think you could steal from me? The Sierra Madre is mine.
GID00077967	Christine, scarred by her hunt for Elijah and unable to let him go, perished in the Sierra Madre Casino.
GID00077968	She never completed her mission, nor did she stop to consider what had driven her to accept the mission in the first place.
GID00077969	Obsession is another form of greed, a lesson that Christine never learned.
GID00077970	Christine, her mission complete, found new purpose as the Sierra Madre's warden. She watched over it silently - by choice.
GID00077971	Over time, the Ghost People came to see her as one of the Holograms. They would watch, silently, as she walked among them.
GID00077972	At times, Christine thought of the Courier, who had kept Elijah's hand from her throat.
GID00077973	The Courier reminded her of the other courier she had met in the Big Empty, and wondered if the two had found each other at last.
GID00077974	She did not think of them again until she heard the legends of the Divide.
GID00077975	The Divide, where the two messengers, the two couriers, fought beneath an ancient flag, at the edge of the world.
GID00077976	Dean Domino, entertainer, singer... thief... had his last show on the Sierra Madre stage.
GID00077977	The heist he spent over two hundred years planning fell apart, just as the first, by underestimating his partner's strength.
GID00077978	Not long after the Courier left the Villa, the lights in the theater shut off, one by one.
GID00077979	Only Dean's Hologram remained on stage, singing silently to an empty room.
GID00077980	Still... as consumed as he had been with its riches and ruin, the Sierra Madre had held him captive long ago.
GID00077981	Dean Domino, entertainer, singer... thief... explored the Sierra Madre not long after he was rescued by the Courier.
GID00077982	Once he left the theater, the Sierra Madre recognized him as a guest, and many doors opened to him. He had to admit, it had been built to last.
GID00077983	During his search, he came across the final records of Vera and Sinclair, and realized what happened the night the bombs fell.
GID00077984	He felt strangely sad for a moment, and he had no idea why.
GID00077985	Shrugging it off, his mind turned instead to where the Courier had come from. Vegas still survived, out there in the Mojave.
GID00077986	Its sights, sounds... and casinos, ripe for the taking.
GID00077987	So giving the Sierra Madre one last nod and a wink, he set off beyond the Cloud to begin again.
GID00077988	When Dog fell in the Sierra Madre casino, two died as one.
GID00077989	Dog died hungry, alone, frightened.
GID00077990	The voice in his head died with him. Screaming. Furious. Enraged.
GID00077991	But the voice was gone, and Dog was grateful.
GID00077992	At least Dog was dead and the voice needed to watch over him no more.
GID00077993	In the moment before their lives ended, the wall between the two personalities fell. The two became silent as they saw the chain between them.
GID00077994	Hunger and control are twin greeds, something Dog and his shadow had never realized.
GID00077995	Dog forgot himself, as did the voice that raged within him. After their passing, a new voice spoke within the mutant's shell.
GID00077996	It was difficult for the voice to remember the two it once was... there was the beast, Dog consumed by hunger...
GID00077997	...and the other in reverse... the one consumed by control.
GID00077998	Both were driven by need for the other. The Courier brought them together, somehow, joined the two into one.
GID00077999	All that happened at the Sierra Madre, was a faint memory to the new personality... like a flickering light in the clouds of the mind.
GID00078000	The new voice did not think of the Courier again until the battle at the Divide reached his ears.
GID00078001	The battle between the two couriers, beneath the torn skies and the Old World flag... each bearing a message for the other.
GID00078002	And the mutant prayed the Courier that had saved him... had been saved in return.
GID00078003	Dog, free of the voice inside his head and no longer waiting on the voice of the Master, wandered back West.
GID00078004	His hunger never ended. Often, small communities would suddenly vanish.
GID00078005	They were assumed to have been hit by Wasteland creatures and dragged away... dogs, Brahmin, and humans alike.
GID00078006	Freed of both Dog and the one who held Dog's leash, the other voice resumed control. First the mind, then finally, the mutant's shell.
GID00078007	His first act was to tend to the scars on the body with careful hands, slowly healing all the scars except the ragged name torn on his chest.
GID00078008	He briefly thought of remaining at the Sierra Madre. But it was a monument built by humans, representing something he no longer needed.
GID00078009	He began walking west, in search of others like him. As he did, he spoke of the courier who had set him free and allowed his life to begin again.
GID00078010	Wasn't sure until now I could trust you. Now I know.
GID00078011	Look, when I woke up here... however that happened... I had this key on me - I think it belongs to her.
GID00078012	Haven't had a chance to use it yet - might open the dresser, or the safe - didn't have time to experiment with it before you arrived. Here you go.
GID00078013	Wasn't sure until now I could trust you. Now I know.
GID00078014	Silence suits me fine. When your master shows, I'll deal with him, too.
GID00078015	I've been hunting the one who hijacked your Pip-Boy, Elijah, for... some time.
GID00078016	He cannot leave the Sierra Madre alive. What he's done... what he's done here is nothing compared to what he's done in the past.
GID00078017	The only way to bring him out is if you get to the vault... he won't allow you to go down there alone. That's when we kill him.
GID00078018	Good luck. He's... not an easy opponent. If I can, I'll help. Might be able to figure something out using the Sierra Madre's computer systems.
GID00078019	[Christine nods, and steps slightly behind you, waiting.]
GID00078020	We'll see.
GID00078021	Music to my ears.
GID00078022	[Christine nods.]
GID00078023	Good. I was growing... impatient.
GID00078024	Rhhhr. Dog will follow.
GID00078025	[Christine sniffs the air, then touches her neck and frowns. She gestures at the air and taps her wrist.]
GID00078026	[Christine looks around, then nods toward a terminal on the far side of the room.]
GID00078027	[Christine points to an electrical box on the wall, and twists her hand.]
GID00078028	[Christine shakes her head as you approach the edge of the catwalk. She turns away from the catwalk and begins looking around.]
GID00078029	[Christine nods at the toxic cloud below, then makes a walking motion with her fingers and slowly shakes her head.]
GID00078030	[Christine's eyes narrow. She raises an index finger, as if listening, then points ahead grimly and pulls back an imaginary trigger.]
GID00078031	[Christine nods at you, then the Ghost Person on the ground, makes a neck-chopping motion.]
GID00078032	[She circles her finger around the Fountain and moves her fingers and thumb together rapidly, as if talking.]
GID00078033	[She frowns, stops moving her hand, then points at the Pip-Boy at your wrist.]
GID00078034	Surprised that Super Mutant didn't eat you... and don't get me started on Dean.
GID00078035	So... I just rasp out some words, and the vault opens? That woman, the starlet... she didn't build this place, why would the builder do that?
GID00078036	I know. The sealed doors, the security... it's almost a fortress. Think that's why we're being ordered to come here and crack it open?
GID00078037	Yeah, still functional. Lot of garbage data on it, its basic procedures should still work fine.
GID00078038	Looks like you got almost everything, not much more I can extract... "doctor."
GID00078039	I can see... check the root, recent diagnostics...
GID00078040	Lot of Med-X was dispensed for... Vera Keyes. Guess that's her corpse there for certain... and why all those meds are scattered around in here.
GID00078041	...here's the medical report. Looks like she had some sort of terminal condition... diagnosis isn't conclusive, must have been painful.
GID00078042	I'm not even sure she knew, if these medical reports are enough. She must have been numb most of the time.
GID00078043	All right. Just glad I can answer you now.
GID00078044	No... they run a lot deeper than that.
GID00078045	While I was hunting Elijah in the Big Empty, he trapped me in one of those medical research centers buried there.
GID00078046	It... did something to my head... and I got off lucky. It's difficult enough to read now, and somehow the leap between what's in my head and words...
GID00078047	...it just ends up being a mish-mash of symbols, not letters. Can still do math, formulas, equations... writing poetry's out.
GID00078048	Yeah... I saw records of other "patients," and what had been done to them. Some couldn't hear anything but static. Others, just... gibbering wrecks.
GID00078049	Never going back... and Elijah was on his way here, so I couldn't stop to see if it was something I could fix...
GID00078050	...if you can even fix what happened to me when they jabbed the electrodes into my skull and turned my head into a flashlight.
GID00078051	Then I got here, and my voice got severed... now I have a new one. Another thing Elijah has to answer for.
GID00078052	Dean? Dean Domino?
GID00078053	Why would he want to torture me? If he wanted to do that, he could keep his singing career going... or keep staring at me.
GID00078054	What? Open something... my voice. That's why it's hers... someone wanted to use me as a key.
GID00078055	All right, I can do that... hope you're ready.
GID00078056	To the vault... of course. That makes sense.
GID00078057	An audio-lock to where? To the Sierra Madre vault. It's voice-activated. And he wanted in.
GID00078058	That makes sense. So... those bodies in the Clinic... all right. Dean always felt like the odd one out, and he kept... studying me.
GID00078059	[SUCCEEDED] [She nods, and raises her hands, palms facing each other, then rotates in a 180 degree arc and back again.]
GID00078060	[FAILED] [She rolls her eyes, opens her mouth to speak, then stops, her face tensing up in frustration.]
GID00078061	The Gala went off, the Switching Station opened up - thought the screeching in the Auto-Doc was bad, Station worse.
GID00078062	Got outside, saw the light show, and it was enough to make me run to the casino.
GID00078063	Also... it seemed like the lights and speakers were helping to guide me... guess your master wanted a back-up in case you died.
GID00078064	As for being assigned to this floor... maybe it's because of my new voice. Your guess is as good as mine. Maybe it recognized me as a guest.
GID00078065	It's possible. This place is immense... and it still has power, food dispensers, security... was it all for Pre-War guests? Or for her?
GID00078066	All right. If you go down there, are you prepared... what if you don't come back?
GID00078067	I... just wanted to make sure you're ready. When you go down there, that may be it for us... we won't be needed anymore.
GID00078068	The one who made these collars, he'll follow you down there. And he won't let you leave. He's not one for sharing, never was.
GID00078069	[She taps the collar and then opens and closes her hand really fast.]
GID00078070	[She taps her collar, then opens and closes her hand really fast.]
GID00078071	[She points at your Pip-Boy, her collar, and then your collar. After a second, then she opens and closes her hand slower.]
GID00078072	[She points at your collar, then hers, then nods at your Pip-Boy. She makes a triangle motion, then the same slow pulse as before with her fingers.]
GID00078073	Love makes people do strange things. Won't argue that. It can drive you crazy sometimes if you can't... connect.
GID00078074	If they loved each other, and they were together... I suppose that's all that mattered.
GID00078075	But she's in that side room, dead, because the casino wouldn't let her leave. And who knows where he is.
GID00078076	You did? Looks like even the Old World can't keep you out when you've got a mind to get in.
GID00078077	Fine. I hear my collar beeping though, I've got the route to the exit all mapped out.
GID00078078	[She nods... then gestures at your hand, offers hers.]
GID00078079	[She holds it, meeting your eyes intently for a few moments. She gives your hand a gentle squeeze, then releases it and smiles slightly.]
GID00078080	[She frowns, then waves you away and focuses on the terminal.]
GID00078081	[She narrows her eyes, determined, and gives a last nod.]
GID00078082	[She tries to open her mouth and nothing comes out. Her eyes narrow and her hands ball into fists.]
GID00078083	[She touches her collar, then shakes her head in frustration and nods at you to go ahead.]
GID00078084	[Christine tilts her head slightly, glances at your collar, then your Pip-Boy. She opens her mouth, frowns, then closes it.]
GID00078085	[Her face looks sad, and she taps her chest once, slowly. She nods at you, then the exit.]
GID00078086	[Christine takes a step back from your gaze... her eyes widen in alarm, she takes one step, then two toward the elevator.]
GID00078087	[Christine studies the elevator frame, raises her hands... then sets them down... then raises them up again.]
GID00078088	[She gives a silent sigh of exasperation, and frowns at the elevator, and her hand brushes the side of her face, tracing the scar.]
GID00078089	[She turns to you, relieved, and nods... then she turns away, and her face crumbles. She makes motions with her fingers, then clenches her fists.]
GID00078090	[Her face becomes angry. She points at the elevator, points downward, then wraps her arms around her and shakes her head.]
GID00078091	"Begin again, but know when to let go." Let's see what happens.
GID00078092	I... can't let him leave here. Look, you've done so much, and he's not going to show himself until you go down there.
GID00078093	[SUCCEEDED] I...
GID00078094	[FAILED] No... no, you have it wrong. Look, it's now or never, all right? Let me open the elevator.
GID00078095	I can't let go. Every time I've thought about it...
GID00078096	I've lost him so many times. He needs to die... what happened here, with us? He's... he's done so much worse.
GID00078097	I know. And he will kill me, I can't get the collar off. Even if I could, I need to be sure - see his eyes, his face, when he dies.
GID00078098	You have to promise me. Promise me you'll deal with him... if I see him, I...
GID00078099	I can't. It's my mission, has been. This has to be done.
GID00078100	I... I didn't want this to happen. Ending him is more important than saving you. For what it's worth... I'm sorry.
GID00078101	All right. All right, I'll... but I'll need to leave this floor. He'll pick up my collar, and...
GID00078102	I... never mind. Let me get the vault open... "Begin again... but know when to let go." Sounds like you.
GID00078103	[She is about to nod - then stops, points at herself, and shakes head.]
GID00078104	[FAILED] [She frowns, shakes her head.]
GID00078105	[SUCCEEDED] [She is about to nod - then stops, points at herself, and shakes head.]
GID00078106	[FAILED] [She frowns, shakes her head.]
GID00078107	[She frowns, slowly shakes her head - she opens her mouth, then makes the motion of tuning a dial, then points at herself.]
GID00078108	[She nods, and motions for you to go ahead.]
GID00078109	[She nods, once, then again, points at the two of you, then the Pip-Boy.]
GID00078110	[SUCCEEDED] [She is about to nod - then stops, points at herself, and shakes head.]
GID00078111	[FAILED] [She frowns, shakes her head.]
GID00078112	[She looks puzzled for a second, then glares at you and motions you to move on.]
GID00078113	[Christine holds out her hand, and motions at your Pip-Boy.]
GID00078114	[Christine studies the Pip-Boy intently, turning your arm around as if your wrist's a sensor module she just found.]
GID00078115	[She doesn't seem interested in the screen - she studies the exterior, then the casing. She seems to be making sure it's intact.]
GID00078116	[She frowns, and snaps her fingers at your Pip-Boy.]
GID00078117	[Christine snarls, makes a dismissive wave, and goes back to studying the Fountain intently - then looks at the casino, then the Fountain again.]
GID00078118	[Her finger stabs through the red buttons, narrowing in on the local map. She scrolls to the Sierra Madre's main gate, frowns, backs out.]
GID00078119	[She calls up the local map of the Puesta del Sol Switching Station, zooms in. Her intent expression loses some of its edge as she notes the marker.]
GID00078120	[She looks up at you, points at marker on your Pip-Boy, points West and tilts her head.]
GID00078121	[She points at the Fountain, then at your Pip-Boy... pauses, then points at her collar, then yours.]
GID00078122	[She encircles her throat with her hand, then slowly releases it. Then she motions again to the West.]
GID00078123	[SUCCEEDED] [She slowly nods, looks impressed.]
GID00078124	[FAILED] [She sighs silently, then shakes her head and motions to the West.]
GID00078125	[She sighs silently, then shakes her head and motions to the West.]
GID00078126	[She nods, then waits.]
GID00078127	[She surveys the area, focusing upwards. She glances at the casino, frowns. She then looks West, then East.]
GID00078128	[She glares at you. After a second, she pauses, and smiles slightly, shaking her head. She then makes a circle of the skyline with her finger.]
GID00078129	[She examines the chip for a second, raises it to her eye, then turns it to the side, gauging its diameter and width.]
GID00078130	[She runs her finger over the surface slowly, checking the engraving. She then tosses the chip back to you.]
GID00078131	[She then pretends to look around, sees something on the floor, then pretends to bend down and pick it up. She then looks at you and nods.]
GID00078132	[She frowns, shakes her head.]
GID00078133	[She frowns, shakes her head.]
GID00078134	[SUCCEEDED] [She smiles, nods.]
GID00078135	[FAILED] [She frowns, looks frustrated for a moment, thinking.]
GID00078136	[She frowns, looks frustrated for a moment, thinking.]
GID00078137	[She stands still for a second, then stops, and slowly makes the motion of bending down and scooping something up.]
GID00078138	[Then she holds the imaginary object in her hand, as if heavy, and puts it in front of her, as if on a table.]
GID00078139	[She then hefts what looks like a small box, and pours it on top of the object, looks at it, then reaches down and holds up a small "O."]
GID00078140	[Christine points at your pack, then points at the Fission Battery and the Scrap Metal.]
GID00078141	[SUCCEEDED] [She smiles, nods.]
GID00078142	[She points at your Pip-Boy, makes a motion of opening it up and removing something from it.]
GID00078143	[She then raises her hand and makes the motion of smashing it and holding up the remains.]
GID00078144	[FAILED] [She frowns, then thinks for a moment. She then points at your pack, and taps the back of her wrist.]
GID00078145	Thought you'd leave me in that elevator? I haven't forgotten what you did in the Switching Station, not for a second.
GID00078146	Trapped down in that room in the dark, listening to that sound, like saw blades. I could barely breathe... couldn't even scream!
GID00078147	Was like being operated on in that Auto-Doc in the Clinic... all over again.
GID00078148	Come to throw me in the Auto-Doc? Toss me back in the Clinic where you found me?
GID00078149	Did you know the Stimpak reservoirs ran out within an hour of being in there? I was in there for two weeks, and it kept... repeating the procedure.
GID00078150	No Med-X, no stims, just... that sound, feeling the scalpels... cut. Now... we're going to see how you like it when someone else is in control.
GID00078151	I can switch the proximity of the detonation frequency. Try and run? I'll have the signal seek you out, blow up your collar from a distance.
GID00078152	Come in close, maybe get the upper hand? I'll set off the proximity detonator, and your collar'll blow.
GID00078153	[She points at the casino, makes a movement with her hands as if talking, and then repeats the squinting gesture.]
GID00078154	[Christine waits, studying you.]
GID00078155	[She nods, impressed. Then she points at you, then her and makes a circle.]
GID00078156	[She nods. She then makes a series of hand motions to represent weight and amounts - enough so you think you could do it on your own.]
GID00078157	When we first met, I thought I recognized the collar technology. Just needed some time to experiment with it.
GID00078158	I noticed the signal lag as soon as you arrived on the floor. Collar detonator signal's down to a dull thud, more like a heartbeat than a screech.
GID00078159	You think you can kill me, then make a run for the exit before my dead man's signal catches you and blows that collar. Not gonna be that easy.
GID00078160	The Suites here gave me enough tools and enough time that our frequencies... I can push and pull that collar of yours however I want.
GID00078161	Silence suits me fine. When your master shows, I'll deal with him, too.
GID00078162	[SUCCEEDED] I did. And it means I can control your movements.
GID00078163	[FAILED] You'll find out.
GID00078164	[SUCCEEDED] Oh, it helps... as long as I need to control your movements.
GID00078165	[FAILED] Free? I have more freedom of movement than you do, and that's all I need.
GID00078166	You'll find out.
GID00078167	Try and run, it won't matter, the signal will find you. Get too close to me, then the signal'll lock on. You can't get away.
GID00078168	We'll see. I don't think you're gonna have the time.
GID00078169	You, Elijah... it doesn't matter. Both of you have run out of places to hide.
GID00078170	[SUCCEEDED] No, I believe you. All along, you were watching out for yourself. I understand.
GID00078171	But I wonder what you would have done if there hadn't been these collars. Would you have gotten me out of the Clinic at all?
GID00078172	So as long as we're "in this together," and it's a choice between you and me? I know what you're going to choose.
GID00078173	I'm not gonna wait for that to happen - again. I'm tired of being controlled.
GID00078174	[FAILED] I believe you. And that's not the point. That collar... I believe you got caught by Elijah, too. I don't think it changes who you are.
GID00078175	How you behaved in the Villa... all that was you. And as bad as these collars are, maybe it kept you from being worse.
GID00078176	And that's the worst part about all this. That it takes something like that to keep you from hurting someone else.
GID00078177	Dean? He put me in there? No, I don't believe it. He didn't have any reason to torture me. You, on the other hand...
GID00078178	An audio-lock to where? To the Sierra Madre vault. It's voice-activated. And he wanted in.
GID00078179	That makes sense. So... those bodies in the Clinic... all right. Dean always felt like the odd one out, and he kept... studying me.
GID00078180	He was trying to figure out if I recognized him... and see if my throat healed. I'll deal with you first, then I'll deal with him.
GID00078181	[She pauses, then draws a jagged symbol like electricity in the air, then puts on an odd, staring face.]
GID00078182	[She keeps the blank face for a second, then slowly blinks, looks around. She looks at her hands, shakes them, then lets them go limp.]
GID00078183	[She shakes her head... then stops, as if thinking.]
GID00078184	[SUCCEEDED] [She nods, slowly, and then makes the motion of typing and drawing X's and lines in the air, and then gives a thumbs up.]
GID00078185	[FAILED] [She looks distant... then slowly shakes her head.]
GID00078186	[She nods, smiles.]
GID00078187	[She nods.]
GID00078188	[She nods. She raises an eyebrow, points at you, makes a circle, then points at your feet.]
GID00078189	[Christine looks at you, frowns. Then glances at the casino, her eyes narrowed. She stops breathing for a second, as if holding it in.]
GID00078190	[She ignores you for a second, still staring at the casino. Then she glances at you, and her face and stance relax slightly.]
GID00078191	[She points at her collar, then the casino with an irritated look. She then folds her arms and raises an eyebrow.]
GID00078192	[SUCCEEDED] [She looks like she's about to shake her head, stops, and then puts her hand over her eyes and squints, as if staring in the distance.]
GID00078193	[FAILED] [She glares at you a moment, then slowly shakes her head.]
GID00078194	[SUCCEEDED] [She looks like she's about to shake her head, stops, and then puts her hand over her eyes and squints, as if staring in the distance.]
GID00078195	[FAILED] [She glares at you a moment, then slowly shakes her head.]
GID00078196	I've... done worse. Much worse... and for more hopeless causes, and I will again.
GID00078197	[She nods.]
GID00078198	[She wrinkles her face, frowns, and looks angry. She touches her throat, traces the scar with her finger, then points the finger at the casino.]
GID00078199	[She then points at your collars, points at the casino. Then she matches your gaze with a dark expression, then draws a slow line across her throat.]
GID00078200	[She gives a nod. Then another nod, even slower.]
GID00078201	[She nods grimly. She seems satisfied.]
GID00078202	[Christine's expression relaxes slightly, and she nods.]
GID00078203	[Christine's expression becomes furious, and she raises her hands, draws jagged lines in the air.]
GID00078204	[She then points at you, then the direction of the casino, and makes the motion of two hands talking to each other.]
GID00078205	[As one hand continues to talk, she moves the other hand to the wrist, and constricts until the other hand slows, stops talking.]
GID00078206	[Christine looks at you, then shakes her head, points at your collar, then the front gate and shakes her head.]
GID00078207	[She then slowly shakes her head and draws an "X" in the air.]
GID00078208	[She then slowly shakes her head and draws an "X" in the air.]
GID00078209	[She looks at you for a moment, studying you. She doesn't move. After a second or two, she frowns.]
GID00078210	[She frowns, glances at your feet, then nods. She then raises an eyebrow, points at you, makes a circle, then points at your feet.]
GID00078211	[She continues to look at you for a moment, studying you, then her eyes fall to your collar, then your Pip-Boy.]
GID00078212	[She glances back up at you, then she circles herself and points at the ground between you.]
GID00078213	[She repeats the circling motion again. This time, she lowers her hand and circles her finger inward, until she's pointing at the spot between you.]
GID00078214	[Still pointing at the ground between you two, she raises an eyebrow.]
GID00078215	[SUCCEEDED] [She smiles, nods.]
GID00078216	[FAILED] [She makes a mock sigh.]
GID00078217	[She waits. After a second, she raises her eyebrow again.]
GID00078218	[She shrugs, then taps the back of her palm in the direction of the Fountain.]
GID00078219	[She shrugs, then taps the back of her palm, pointing West and down.]
GID00078220	[Almost against her will, she smiles. After a moment, the smile fades, and she points at the ground again.]
GID00078221	[She looks at you for a second, studying you. Then nods.]
GID00078222	[She points at you, then points at the casino, and she slowly shakes her head - then points in the direction of the main gate.]
GID00078223	[She frowns, puts her hands on her hips and glares at you. After a second, she rolls her eyes.]
GID00078224	[She then makes a mocking, slow intake of breath, and then winces. Then she glances at you, points in the direction of main gate.]
GID00078225	[She looks at you for a moment, glances at your collar, shrugs. She then lightly grabs her neck with both hands, holds it for a moment.]
GID00078226	[Then her hands fall away. She looks at you, looks at the exit and nods.]
GID00078227	[She slowly shakes her head, then points at the ground.]
GID00078228	[She frowns. Glances in the direction of the casino, then the exit, then back in the direction of the casino.]
GID00078229	[She shrugs... without strength or conviction. She isn't looking at you when she does.]
GID00078230	[She nods slowly, as if thinking. Then she raises an eyebrow, looks skeptical, then shrugs.]
GID00078231	[She points downwards, makes a circle around her, then back to the same spot... and then her finger drifts, circling, and she makes a mock-frown.]
GID00078232	[SUCCEEDED] [She shakes her head, points at herself, then points at you, nods.]
GID00078233	[FAILED] [She looks frustrated, then makes a dismissive wave.]
GID00078234	[She shakes her head and rolls her eyes.]
GID00078235	[She nods.]
GID00078236	[She nods once.]
GID00078237	[She slowly shakes her head. She points at the ground, then moves each leg outward, straddling the place where she's pointing.]
GID00078238	[She nods.]
GID00078239	[She frowns, shakes her head... pauses... then tilts her head slightly, nods slowly.]
GID00078240	[She frowns, makes a mock motion of loading a gun, then hefting it to her shoulder and taking aim at something in the distance.]
GID00078241	[Then she pauses, makes a sweeping circle, then puts her arms in a circle around it, as if covering it.]
GID00078242	[Shakes her head and makes a motion of two fingers walking.]
GID00078243	[SUCCEEDED] [She looks impressed, nods.]
GID00078244	[FAILED] [She looks frustrated, then makes a dismissive wave.]
GID00078245	[She looks at you, as if surprised. Then glances at your collar, wrinkles her face, and points at it.]
GID00078246	[She makes a wide sweeping circle of the area, looking around... then brings both hands back to her, then to her neck, and holds it.]
GID00078247	[Her hands still on her neck, she looks at you gravely, then shakes her head.]
GID00078248	[She nods slowly, hands still locked on her throat. She looks pained for a moment, and she breaks from your gaze.]
GID00078249	[Her fingers flutter, almost frantically, for a second, and she runs her hands along her scalp, then her throat - then the collar.]
GID00078250	[She points at your Pip-Boy, almost with frustration... then gestures all around her, and her shoulders seem to sag.]
GID00078251	[After a moment, she glances back at you, glances around her, then shakes her head slowly.]
GID00078252	[She points at your collar, then hers, and shakes her head slowly... then cuts the air with her hand and her face becomes blank.]
GID00078253	[She gives you a snarl, glances at your collar, makes a dismissive wave.]
GID00078254	[SUCCEEDED] [Her face wrinkles more, and then she gives a reluctant smile.]
GID00078255	[FAILED] [She looks frustrated, then makes a dismissive wave.]
GID00078256	[She nods and raises a finger.]
GID00078257	[Still smiling, she rolls her eyes, and then slowly taps the back of her wrist.]
GID00078258	[She looks at you, surprised. Then she opens her mouth as if to laugh... silently.]
GID00078259	[Almost as soon as she utters her silent laugh, she stops, looks pained, and her expression becomes dark.]
GID00078260	[She doesn't look at you, continues to stare darkly in front of her.]
GID00078261	[After a moment, she glances at you, then taps the back of her wrist. She nods in front of her.]
GID00078262	[She shakes her head and rolls her eyes.]
GID00078263	[She frowns and raises her middle finger.]
GID00078264	[She shakes her head and pumps her fist near her chest.]
GID00078265	[She nods. She makes a motion with her hands around her chin, drawing it down, and then she raises her hands and clenches them at the sky.]
GID00078266	[She shakes her head... then stops mid-way, frowns... then tilts her head, as if thinking. She seems lost in thought for a moment.]
GID00078267	[She glances at you, as if caught, then she smiles slightly, but there's an edge to it. Then she shakes her head, slowly, once.]
GID00078268	[She points at your Pip-Boy.]
GID00078269	[She nods, looks concerned, taps the side of her head, and expands her hands.]
GID00078270	[She shakes her head, points at your Pip-Boy again.]
GID00078271	[She shakes her head, points at your Pip-Boy again and makes a talking motion with her hand.]
GID00078272	[She nods, then circles her ear.]
GID00078273	[She nods, frowns.]
GID00078274	[SUCCEEDED] [She frowns, raises two fingers, and has them walk together. Then she looks down on the two fingers, and her face becomes angry.]
GID00078275	[Then she chops her hand down, and draws the two fingers apart. One of the finger she points at herself.]
GID00078276	[FAILED] [She pauses, looks at you for a second, then shrugs and shakes her head.]
GID00078277	[She repeats the chopping motion, slower, then draws the two fingers apart. She looks sadly at one of the fingers.]
GID00078278	[She nods.]
GID00078279	[She frowns, shakes her head, and even more so at husband.]
GID00078280	[She hesitates, then waves her hand.]
GID00078281	[She shakes her head.]
GID00078282	[She shakes her head, but rolls it side to side.]
GID00078283	[She hesitates, then waves her hand.]
GID00078284	[She hesitates, then waves her hand.]
GID00078285	[She nods, and looks at you a little surprised.]
GID00078286	[She shakes her head, draws the two fingers together, then shakes her head more emphatically.]
GID00078287	[She raises an eyebrow, looks at you.]
GID00078288	[She nods slowly, studying you. She seems to be gauging you again.]
GID00078289	[She makes a slow circle motion after a moment, taps her wrist.]
GID00078290	The Gala went off, the Switching Station opened up - thought the screeching in the Auto-Doc was bad, Station worse.
GID00078291	Got outside, saw the light show, and it was enough to make me run to the casino.
GID00078292	Also... it seemed like the lights and speakers were helping to guide me... guess your master wanted a back-up in case you died.
GID00078293	As for being assigned to this floor... maybe it's because of my new voice. Your guess is as good as mine. Maybe it recognized me as a guest.
GID00078294	[She nods. Once.]
GID00078295	[She shrugs slightly, then waits.]
GID00078296	[She makes a disapproving frown, shakes her head.]
GID00078297	You know what... you're right. I don't need to use the same methods to kill you, and I shouldn't... it would make me as bad as Elijah is.
GID00078298	All right - forget the proximity frequency, we'll decide this ourselves.
GID00078299	[Christine studies the area, then the Police Station. She pretends to unload a weapon and holds up the imaginary cartridge, waving it.]
GID00078300	[Christine looks at the machine and frowns. She points at the narrow slot on the side and raises an eyebrow.]
GID00078301	[Christine stops, glances at the speaker, then glances at your collar, frowning.]
GID00078302	Need to reset this damn thing... switching the frequencies... come on, come on...
GID00078303	Resetting signal... resetting signal.
GID00078304	That's it... signal frequency's hot, let's see how you deal with this.
GID00078305	Switching frequency, asshole.
GID00078306	Switching frequency, bitch.
GID00078307	Seeing what I can do to shut those turrets down from up here... come on... come on...
GID00078308	...got it, two of 'em down... can't shut down the others - he's cut off access. Dammit! Put him down, bury him - whatever it takes!
GID00078309	...got it, two of 'em down... can't shut down the others - he's cut off access. Dammit! Put him down, bury him - whatever it takes!
GID00078310	"Begin again - but know when to let go."
GID00078311	Sinclair's little surgery carts. Kept them around for his lady friend.
GID00078312	What, you need surgery done? Let's get out of here... those speakers on the wall are making my nerves do a dance.
GID00078313	Guess we're going the long way around.
GID00078314	See? That... wasn't so bad, was it?
GID00078315	Looks like we'll have to go through this pea soup. I can get you across.
GID00078316	We're not heading to the police station, are we? Ghost People hunt there.
GID00078317	He's not dead... it's a trick. Get an axe.
GID00078318	Better make sure he's dead. Poke him with a stick or something.
GID00078319	Watch for Hologram security, not as nice as the lady at the fountain, trust me.
GID00078320	What are we doing here? We're not going to find a doctor on call at this hour, trust me.
GID00078321	Place is haunted, got ghosts walking in it.
GID00078322	Look... I give you this key, and there's nothing to keep you from just killing me and running. And as I see it...
GID00078323	...I just gave up my ace in the hole. So... the only chance I've got left is making sure you don't leave.
GID00078324	And there's no way in hell I'm letting you get to the Sierra Madre vault instead of me. Not after all this time.
GID00078325	It's a shame... I regret it. Still, you dames are all the same - things get a little hot, you get cold feet. That's why I'm still alive. You? Well...
GID00078326	You don't just stop robbing casinos, do you? What's that tape... oh, the one with Sinclair's woman, Vera.
GID00078327	What about it? You want me to give you a standing ovation?
GID00078328	Always asking questions when you should be shooting. You're a piece of work, I'll give you that.
GID00078329	Yeah - don't you? Or... guess Vera Keyes got lost along with the rest of the holo-archives when the bomb hit, huh?
GID00078330	Ghost in name and image. Still a looker, though. Got to hand it to Sinclair, sure can pick 'em. Well, or get picked. Whichever.
GID00078331	[SUCCEEDED] Lucky guess... you sure about that? Because if you make a mistake... well, Sierra Madre's got us both.
GID00078332	[FAILED] Yeah, you're a gambler. Me, I don't take chances. Trust me, only one of us has a sure out.
GID00078333	All right, all right... look, I'll hand it over, I promise. No need to get all upset. We can both come out ahead in this.
GID00078334	What? Hey, hey... now... w-wait... I... ah, forget it. Time for the hard way.
GID00078335	What are you talking about? Medical report? Vera wasn't...
GID00078336	...the Med-X and Superstims. And here I thought she was trying to numb herself to the lights.
GID00078337	Sinclair must have known, though. He was dense, not in that way. But... that doesn't make any sense. If she was sick, dying...
GID00078338	...then why build this place? Why start a damn casino and have her be the lock?
GID00078339	Because she could get closer to Sinclair than I ever could. He built this place for her... well, after the two "chanced" to meet.
GID00078340	That's... hmm. Never mind, doesn't change anything. The Sierra Madre's still waiting for us to crack it open.
GID00078341	I waited an entire lifetime! Sitting in that Villa, watching it all fall apart - Sinclair's Sierra Madre towering over everything? Untouched?!
GID00078342	Then you show up, thinking you can just take it all from me, you and the old man running the show? I planned all this, I made it all happen, not you!
GID00078343	Sure, yeah, I have the key on me. I made other keys, too, to unlock the casino and ruin Sinclair, finally. After all these years...
GID00078344	No... now... now I think ruining you and all your plans would be enough for me. Kill me, I still win, you're never getting in the vault.
GID00078345	Well... "safely?" Around here, that word doesn't come cheap.
GID00078346	Safely? What, after your sweet-and-ruthless talk when we first met, now you care about my safety? Right.
GID00078347	Really? You don't strike me as the type, especially after our little "how can I cooperate" chat at my home.
GID00078348	Real funny. Although you know, after your "collar talk" in the Residential area, I believe you.
GID00078349	Look... I strike up the speaker system, there's going to be ghosts all over this place. Any change in the sounds around here...
GID00078350	...the Ghost People are not big on talking, they are big on listening. Hunting. Killing. More vicious than music critics, trust me.
GID00078351	In the middle of town here? Alone? On a rooftop, with a big lightshow in the air?
GID00078352	Tell you what - why don't you just give me one of those Space Age Cosmic Knives so I can slit my wrists, be less painful checking out that way.
GID00078353	Not one for fighting if we can avoid it. Still, wasn't bad at the pistol range and over the years, I've learned how to handle a knife...
GID00078354	...and explosives a bit. A bit. Made a lot of mistakes along the way. Still have my fingers, though.
GID00078355	Partner, I'm not sure this guy's operating with a full deck. My bet? Process of elimination, lowest common denominator.
GID00078356	He figures the "Strong Man"'s needed somewhere, even if it sounds like the Strong Man's two minds about it.
GID00078357	Plus, I'm guessing wherever ol' Doggy Boy's needed doesn't need smarts. I hope not, or we're royally jones'd.
GID00078358	Didn't see anyone come in? Well... they'll be here soon.
GID00078359	And go on, run for the exit door, this'll be fun to watch.
GID00078360	I still need to eat. At least I think I do. The Villa provides... even if it's not as glamorous as the Cantina Madrid.
GID00078361	Once I... well, realized what you could scrounge up around here, I had a lot of time to experiment. Not the best chef, but...
GID00078362	...well, here's the mix, if you can stomach it. I call it a "Sierra Madre Martini."
GID00078363	Scrape some Cloud Residue off the walls, mash it in a Tin Can with some Junk Food from the machines, then hold your nose and down it.
GID00078364	There's Electric Hot Plates around if you can't find a campfire to mix it at. Also, there's other recipes you can do with the Cloud Residue...
GID00078365	...although it might take a hardier survivalist than me to brew them. I stick to martinis.
GID00078366	Christine, that her name? Nice name. I mean, you can't see it on posters, but... never mind.
GID00078367	I don't know. She might need to hold some place where speaking isn't important. Like stage tech? Lighting? Got me.
GID00078368	And me? I've had prime billing in Europe, New York... and this gig doesn't feel like that.
GID00078369	Don't get me wrong, I can hold an audience, conduct a score from the rooftops, but I'm guessing I'm the odd man out in this whole heist.
GID00078370	Little Miss Silence...? Maybe she needs to be in some place where she can be seen, but being heard isn't important?
GID00078371	[SUCCEEDED] Yeah... maybe the drain in power, that'll cause the security systems to shut down enough to let us in. But... getting back out?
GID00078372	No, the place'll close up tighter than an opening at the Fronds. Or Danny Parker's sphincter when he has to tip a doorman.
GID00078373	[FAILED] Interesting... in the sense that having some light show open the Sierra Madre? Interesting to me, who would have thought?
GID00078374	Oh, it'll light up the casino, light up the sky... set the speakers in the Villa to play beautiful, soothing music.
GID00078375	...and when I say soothing music, I mean with the speakers being the state they are, things'll be screaming, all right. Think air raid sirens.
GID00078376	That means it'll wake up everything in town like a hornet's nest. Not sure what a hornet is? Forget it - basically, trouble.
GID00078377	Vera was a big star, back before the Bomb. Not the best actress, but... well, she had other talents. Nice voice, nice legs.
GID00078378	For some reason, Sinclair... he built this place... she caught his eye. Once he was hooked, that was it, had to have her.
GID00078379	So made the introductions, and guess what? He builds this place for her, like some kind of Cleopatra obsession. Wasn't always a deathtrap.
GID00078380	Of course. What, some kind of surprise to you that I knew people once? Used to have my name in lights, all right?
GID00078381	Knew a dozen Veras, or whatever her name was. Uh... "Vera Keyes." Figured I could pay Sinclair back, introduce the two...
GID00078382	...guy was a slouch in the dame department, had to pick up the slack somehow.
GID00078383	The Clinic? Yeah, I did bring her in. Before the Gala... well, before the first Gala Event. A few lifetimes ago.
GID00078384	She was a stress case, throat was shot, all nerves. When she wasn't doped up on Med-X or Superstimming her pain away...
GID00078385	...look, never mind. I don't want to speak bad about her. She was a classy woman, good singer, and if she couldn't act her way out of a box...
GID00078386	...she was Sinclair's world, and that's all that mattered. He didn't need to know any of that, any of her history.
GID00078387	Sure. First, they figure they can get out, escape. Then they start thinking it over, start thinking about how they can have it all.
GID00078388	They start weighing the odds, taking risks... and then taking each other out. Bomb collars or not.
GID00078389	Although... it's odd, the bomb collars weren't linked before like they are now. Guess someone learned what the problem was.
GID00078390	Dead. Either got killed by one of the Villa's attractions, locals, or the beautiful weather.
GID00078391	Can tell you right now - they didn't stick close to each other, and when they did, they let down their guard at the wrong moment.
GID00078392	Some left signposts to others, trying to help them out - just led to them getting killed by someone a little more greedy than they were.
GID00078393	Well... considering my life's on the line, too, yeah, a few things.
GID00078394	First off, keep everyone together. Keep checking behind you, make sure your partners are following... don't let them wander.
GID00078395	Also, don't go running crazy everywhere. Almost every inch of this town is lethal. So if you're not sure, take it real slow.
GID00078396	And speaking of slow, don't go shouting, or attracting attention. Go quiet. The Ghost People find you, it's over.
GID00078397	Right, look - so, not everything about the Villa was the pinnacle of bright ideas.
GID00078398	In order to pull off the Gala, old Sinclair had to get creative... the Sierra Madre announcement, for example. Not just for the casino, not at all.
GID00078399	The Gala's tied to the casino, draws on its power. Might cause it to reset itself, open the doors for a bit like it was supposed to.
GID00078400	Well, Vera's beautiful voice doesn't run on casino power, exactly. Her broadcast is tied into the emergency broadcast signal for the Sierra Madre.
GID00078401	You know, in case of attack? Well, guess what - the night of the Gala Event, the emergency signal went out all right.
GID00078402	But because the broadcast had been hooked up to the Gala Event, instead of an emergency signal, you get Vera's voice on the radio. Great, huh?
GID00078403	Yeah. The Sierra Madre's last song, one only a few people are ever going to hear. A little sad, but what can you do?
GID00078404	Odd Man out... dead weight. Someone you need holding the toolbox, the nurse passing the scalpel, the chauffer driving you to the concert.
GID00078405	Any guy with hands is who he needs up on that rooftop. Guess he thinks I don't rate, looking like I do. Poor him.
GID00078406	Look... those ghosts are going to come out of the wings behind you in a second, the security types, not the "friendly" bald types.
GID00078407	And if you got in here, the door's probably locked tight behind you - so don't back up or run for the exit, you're not going to make it.
GID00078408	Trust me - as soon as you can, run to the door to the left - use the key you got out of the music rag there, and camp out.
GID00078409	As bad as things are, it's going to get a lot worse if either of us pops - so get backstage... until we get a better plan.
GID00078410	Good, go, and don't get yourself killed - do that, and we're both done.
GID00078411	Good, go, and don't get yourself killed - do that, and we're both done.
GID00078412	Look... just get rid of them, all right? Tried to slip off stage, then they all started changing color and raising their hands... not a good sign.
GID00078413	[SUCCEEDED] Uh... right. Uh... let's see... when you get the door open, there'll be an exit door dead ahead. Don't take it.
GID00078414	It's most likely filled with toxins from the vents. So hug the wall, make as much space between you and the door... or it's Cloud Nine in a casket.
GID00078415	Past that... is my dressing room. Under the table there's a footlocker. It's tucked back a bit, so you might miss it. Inside, a gun, some ammo.
GID00078416	Not much help against the ghosts, still, if you're about to give up, call it quits? Throw it to me so I can eat a bullet first.
GID00078417	[FAILED] Anything else? I've told you all I can think of! Now, come on, get going.
GID00078418	You are preaching to the choir. Sinclair and his security... don't even get me started. Those Holograms...
GID00078419	[SUCCEEDED] Yeah... yeah, so what? We got bigger problems with the Holograms... no, no, wait, you're right.
GID00078420	The Theater piped music and sound backstage, which means those little squealers are in the corridors back there, too.
GID00078421	[FAILED] What about them? The speakers won't kill you if you leave them alone, don't worry about them, just get backstage.
GID00078422	Uh... let's see. Um, once you break right, watch each turn in the corridor, one'll be on your right past my dressing room - and up.
GID00078423	Oh, my dressing room - may have left the radio on, right by the table... uh, if you could just shut it off instead of blowing it u... uh, never mind.
GID00078424	And there was a speaker in the prop room, too - on the wall between the entrances. And... well, walk slow - there's bound to be more.
GID00078425	[SUCCEEDED] Yeah... yeah, right. So... let's see... security's here because the show hasn't started. Guests aren't allowed in, so...
GID00078426	...guess we need to start the show. Okay... so when they were setting this place up... we had rehearsals...
GID00078427	...and heh... Sinclair even set up hologram recordings of the shows so we could watch and critique our performances before a fake audience. Whatever.
GID00078428	Thing is, when the recording queued up, a nice, calm, appreciative audience appeared in the Theater - no security with their head-blasting zap rays.
GID00078429	So, find the music, get it to the projector room upstairs, then play it...? Might reset security, worth a shot.
GID00078430	[FAILED] One thing at a time - and buying time is what we need, all right? Think in the now, it'll sort itself out. I hope.
GID00078431	Look, I'm in danger here, all right, not exactly thinking with a level head, so cut me some slack. Please.
GID00078432	The speakers are all controlled by a central console. It's the farthest from the only door out of here...
GID00078433	...so you'd need to do a full circuit of the corridor to get to it. Once there, you'll need to shut it down, and I don't have the code.
GID00078434	If you have the code, you can turn off all the speakers, make them settle down. Getting backstage should buy us time, just take it slow.
GID00078435	The Holotape should be where I left it... no, wait. It's... it's in Vera's dressing room, probably. May... may be a key to her room on my desk.
GID00078436	Anyway... snag the key out of my room, and look around Vera's room, the Holotape has to be there. As for getting it to the projection booth...
GID00078437	Well... sometimes Vera used to watch from the projection booth, so she must have had a master key... look around her room, might be there.
GID00078438	[SUCCEEDED] What? Oh, my left - your right. So, yeah, run to the door on your right. Heh, almost got you killed there. Us killed there.
GID00078439	[FAILED] Right, the locked door to the left. Watch out, the guards are going to materialize in any second, crouch and take it slow.
GID00078440	Do I have to spell it out? Come on. Time's wasting, and those Holograms are going to be on us any second.
GID00078441	What? Are you sure? That song... that stupid song of hers... no, that makes perfect sense.
GID00078442	And it was always playing here in the casino... dammit, if I'd only brought a recording inside... so, what, you're trying to recover it?
GID00078443	Oh, I'm not going to fight you - I'm going to let security show you out. Didn't see anyone come in? Well... they'll be here soon.
GID00078444	Guess Vera echoes down through the ages, then. Sierra Madre hasn't completely forgotten her.
GID00078445	So that's why you showed... you wanted what was in the music archives on this floor, hook up the signal. Nice.
GID00078446	[SUCCEEDED] No... no... the collars... I know what happened now. Sure, mine activated... but it feels different, the electronic tapdance inside.
GID00078447	I can kill you and still make it out while security is busy frying you to a crisp. Hands are clean, then smooth sailing to the Sierra Madre.
GID00078448	[FAILED] No... I know how the collars behave now, in here anyway. At least the Sierra Madre gave me that.
GID00078449	I should be thankful, in a second, it'll give me another gift - with any luck, security'll leave enough of your ashes for an urn on my mantle.
GID00078450	Well, yeah in the Villa. But I have one inside, too.
GID00078451	We can talk about that later, though, it's not important right now... you came for me, any sign of the others?
GID00078452	Figures... wish he'd show himself, although I'm betting he's not doing that until we've cracked the vault.
GID00078453	That means we'll still need a copy of the song to get into the vault... and after all I went through to smuggle a copy inside.
GID00078454	Wait... you said this guy wanted you to deal with all of us first? What, is everyone else here?
GID00078455	It's safe. I hope. Right now, let's focus on getting everyone else to safety, all right? Everybody else all right?
GID00078456	Forget that walking stomach, not interested in being his lunch... just glad the girl's all right. Where is she? Is she here?
GID00078457	Wait... no, if the Sierra Madre assigned people to floors, she's got to have been sent to Vera's room, right? That's irony for you.
GID00078458	Perfect, couldn't have worked out better.
GID00078459	Dead? For the love of... this whole heist was a gamble anyway. So much for back-up plans.
GID00078460	Dead? For the love of... Chopping up her voice box was a gamble anyway. So much for back-up plans.
GID00078461	Figured that out, huh? Clever.
GID00078462	Figures... wish he'd show himself, although I'm betting he's not doing that until we've cracked the vault.
GID00078463	That means we'll still need a copy of the song to get into the vault... and after all I went through to smuggle a copy inside.
GID00078464	Wait... you said this guy wanted you to deal with all of us first? What, is everyone else here?
GID00078465	You know... people can still surprise me. All right, I believe you. You got spine. Guess the bombs left a little human goodwill behind.
GID00078466	At least you're honest, can't blame you. I'd have done the same if there was a trigger to my head... or a collar on my neck.
GID00078467	I'll be fine, don't worry about me. Go on ahead, I'm going to try and unwind.
GID00078468	All right - well, thanks for bailing me out.
GID00078469	So - what, you're heading to the main terminal now that you've got this floor unlocked?
GID00078470	Hnh. You got a point. You better not let me down. Try and get into the Sierra Madre without me? You'll wish you hadn't.
GID00078471	All right... look, if the Holograms are here to keep me company, then... I don't mind staying here for a while.
GID00078472	But listen... when this thing goes off, try and get into the Sierra Madre without me? You'll wish you hadn't.
GID00078473	It's safe. I hope. Right now, let's focus on getting everyone else to safety, all right? Everybody else all right?
GID00078474	And here I thought I was being clever. Teach me to hold my cards a little closer to the chest... whole heist was a gamble anyway.
GID00078475	Still... there's a way to recover the song from the Sierra Madre archives, right? Just set up links to each floor, then use the lobby terminal?
GID00078476	[SUCCEEDED] Dead? After all I went through... after all that hauling her body through the streets?
GID00078477	[FAILED] Really... "partner." Now, now... you can't pull one over on Dean... but you tried, didn't you?
GID00078478	So you don't want to share... keep her from me, huh? All we have to do is make her sing, and it's all ours.
GID00078479	Although... why lie to me? I'm hurt. I mean, we don't even need her if you get the terminals live, and the music kicking.
GID00078480	Forget that walking stomach, not interested in being his lunch... just glad the girl's all right. Where is she? Is she here?
GID00078481	Wait... no, if the Sierra Madre assigned people to floors, she's got to have been sent to Vera's room, right? That's irony for you.
GID00078482	Perfect, couldn't have worked out better. So - what, you're heading to the main terminal now that you've got this floor unlocked?
GID00078483	Dead? For the love of... chopping up her voice box was a gamble anyway. So much for back-up plans.
GID00078484	Still... there's a way to recover the song from the Sierra Madre archives, right? Just set up links to each floor, then use the lobby terminal?
GID00078485	All right... even if they all end up dead, though, you say there's a way to recover the song from the Sierra Madre archives.
GID00078486	Just set up links to each floor, then use the lobby terminal to tie it all together? Easy. Just a little legwork.
GID00078487	Yeah? Little bit of two-reel memories... we're here to steal from the Sierra Madre, not from each other.
GID00078488	"Blackmail" is such a strong word. I asked her, she said yes, then... she started to get cold feet.
GID00078489	I blame Sinclair... he was such a victim, that maybe she felt it would be too easy... it doesn't matter.
GID00078490	Sinclair built this whole town to accommodate her. Same with the casino's voice lock. He wanted to make sure she had access to everything.
GID00078491	And since I already had access to Vera... well, that meant I had access to the vault, too.
GID00078492	What wasn't I blackmailing her with. Chem use, indiscretions, more chem use... the usual Hollywood tune.
GID00078493	Like Sinclair, people are the architects of their own misfortunes. Leave themselves wide open for someone to waltz right in and take what they want.
GID00078494	As long as they take a single step into the trap. Get a few pictures, get a little dirt, and that person's your piano.
GID00078495	Vera? Med-X was her thing, even Superstimmed herself for the after-rush. Sick.
GID00078496	Way I figure it, you'll try and run for the exit, and only I know where the key is - and where the safest place in the whole theater is: backstage.
GID00078497	You, you're trapped down there, and you couldn't shut off the speakers, unlock the doors, or cancel security if you tried.
GID00078498	I'm not a betting man, I've come too far to leave it to chance.
GID00078499	What... what now? Try and come back here?
GID00078500	No, you belong out in the audience... I mean, not like... uh... you could get backstage. That key you snagged, it won't work.
GID00078501	Of all the... where the hell are those stupid Holograms already? Even if you get back here, you won't live long, trust me.
GID00078502	No, you want to know why? Because there's more beneath the streets, in the buildings, and oh - everywhere else.
GID00078503	They hear anything out of the ordinary, especially "music" screaming through the speakers when I close the connection? They'll be here, fast.
GID00078504	Take? It's not going to take anything because you couldn't offer me anything to stay here.
GID00078505	The Ghost People'll come out of the woodwork when the Gala Event starts blaring, and when they see me trapped up here? It's curtains for Dean.
GID00078506	[SUCCEEDED] Well... yeah. If the Hologram systems still work, that'd do the trick.
GID00078507	Okay... all right, you call up some of those Old World stiffs, that'd be an audience I wouldn't mind having below.
GID00078508	[FAILED] Yeah, and how can you guarantee that? I'm not waiting here alone, trust me.
GID00078509	I mean, if I had a few of those Holograms... or a few hundred... surrounding me, maybe. I'd settle for two, enough to cover a quick exit.
GID00078510	You're full of it - you kill me, we both die. You wouldn't dare.
GID00078511	So you leaving me here? No dice, not going to happen, and nothing you can say will change my mind.
GID00078512	You can look all you want... I still feel safer with a pair of Hologram escorts to make it through the area.
GID00078513	You powered the Holograms up? Well... yeah, that's pretty good protection. Sure worked at the fountain, Vera kept the Ghost People away.
GID00078514	But, uh... how do I know the power won't suddenly go out? And... I don't know, this still sounds risky to me. For me.
GID00078515	If I remember correctly, there should be two Holograms you can switch on in the area... just don't remember how.
GID00078516	Do that, and I'll consider waiting on the rooftop. Maybe.
GID00078517	What? What are you talking about?
GID00078518	You wouldn't. You need me to strike up the sparking chords there. Breaking my legs isn't any way to get me to dance.
GID00078519	You wouldn't... no, yeah, you would. I would. If I thought you screaming wouldn't attract more of the locals.
GID00078520	All right, I'll stay here. For now. But you leave me high and dry, make a run for the Sierra Madre? You'll pay for it, I promise you.
GID00078521	What? You wouldn't. I mean... no, wait, you would. You don't bluff, ever since you first showed up in the Villa and we chatted.
GID00078522	No... you wouldn't. You're not the type. Even when you first showed up in the Villa, you didn't threaten me.
GID00078523	You just let me talk, not even letting on that our collars were linked, when all you had to do was tell me that to get me to come along.
GID00078524	So... no, I don't think you'll shut them off. You don't threaten people, not your way.
GID00078525	Wait, hold on. I didn't say I was scared. Heh, heh. Cold feet? Don't be ridiculous. I've played to worse crowds than this, I can hold the fort here.
GID00078526	[SUCCEEDED] Well... yeah. You got a point.
GID00078527	[FAILED] What do I want? I want a little more insurance than some Old World Villa construction to guard me, all right?
GID00078528	[SUCCEEDED] Well... yeah. You got a point.
GID00078529	[FAILED] Trust you? Right. You're not the one who has to sit up here and wait for the Ghost People to show.
GID00078530	[SUCCEEDED] Well... yeah. You got a point.
GID00078531	[FAILED] Really? You're not the one standing up here waiting for the Ghost People to show, all right?
GID00078532	Oh, right, after all the "we'll both blow up if you don't do as I say" talk we first had. Not put me in danger? Right.
GID00078533	Yeah... yeah, you're right. You didn't have to switch on those Holograms, and you did.
GID00078534	Even when you first showed up in the Villa, you didn't threaten me, were just willing to cooperate to get through this. Hnh.
GID00078535	Unless he's got a friend, no dice. Nobody relies on a single escape route unless they want to get caught.
GID00078536	Unless he's got a friend, no dice. Nobody relies on a single escape route unless they want to get caught.
GID00078537	The police station... Ghost People love this place, no idea why. Might be the Holograms nearby.
GID00078538	Hey, those are my emergency supplies! Uh... I-I mean... I know we're in a bad spot here... just, uh, leave me something, all right?
GID00078539	Yeah, go on... help yourself. Why not?
GID00078540	Leave me something, will you?
GID00078541	Never should have left those stupid handprints. Dead giveaway.
GID00078542	Those machines... Sinclair's little gifts, lasted longer than he did. If you need food, stims... put in a chip, hold out your hand.
GID00078543	Pretty as a picture.
GID00078544	Uh... Dean, I... didn't hear you come in.
GID00078545	I'm not wearing my dancing shoes, so I walk a little softly now. What, you think I was a Chinaman, come to cut your American throat?
GID00078546	Dean, really.
GID00078547	What... no hug? Come here.
GID00078548	Dean, I'm getting ready.
GID00078549	You sing like a bird, pop the safe, and we're as through as through can be.
GID00078550	Dean... I just... about tonight, I... I don't know.
GID00078551	You don't know? I ask one simple favor of you, and you tell me "no?"
GID00078552	I didn't say no. I just said that... I don't think...
GID00078553	You're right, you don't think.
GID00078554	I don't need you - I'll send you back to the farm, worse off than you were, because you'll have seen the Sierra Madre, and had to let it all go.
GID00078555	I could have gotten any leggy dame out of Hollywood to get out here and play Sinclair's heart strings.
GID00078556	You just happened to be the one I caught, and it was really your own fault, a little too much into the chems and meds, and...
GID00078557	Aw, shhh, don't cry. Look, I'm not trying to hurt you. Just one last little job, a little less dirty, a little less messy. He trusts you, Vera.
GID00078558	And so do I. After this, I promise you, all those other Holotapes, they'll go away.
GID00078559	Of course, Dean.
GID00078560	Is... is this thing on? You hear me down there? Trying to help you out here... disable the speakers, play a little music...
GID00078561	...and that's more like it, got a beat you can swing to. And they won't set off your collar any more - just hit that guy where it hurts.
GID00078562	...and that's more like it, got a beat you can swing to. And they won't set off your collar any more - just hit that guy where it hurts.
GID00078563	Hnnhhhh... Dog getting full.
GID00078564	OM NOM NOM
GID00078565	Rhrrrrrr...
GID00078566	RhhhhaaarrrRRRRRRRR!
GID00078567	Can't take any chances, though... you may be some victim who simply stumbled down here. If so, can't let you let Dog out... no, not yet.
GID00078568	If you're who I think you are, you came to fetch Dog, use him to drag others here. Now I'll use you - and that Pip-Boy you're wearing.
GID00078569	You're smart. Clever. The key to Dog's cage is simple. Take my voice to the cage above. Let me speak to the beast inside.
GID00078570	Then you and I... we can talk.
GID00078571	Hnnh. City smells bad in some places, so bad it makes people fall down.
GID00078572	Careful, the Villa's filled with pockets from the Cloud. Lethal.
GID00078573	I'm in control. The Master won't help Dog now... and it won't help you.
GID00078574	Not listen, Dog out of cage now.
GID00078575	[SUCCEEDED] The key? Why it's the Old Man, the one who brought us here.
GID00078576	I hid the key on me so Dog wouldn't know... I just need the Old Man to show up, so he and I can talk.
GID00078577	If Dog was in control when the Old Man appeared... well, he would just do whatever he commanded, as always. And I can't have that.
GID00078578	[FAILED] It's close, safe, as you know.
GID00078579	[FAILED] It's close, safe. I did lock myself in, after all.
GID00078580	[SUCCEEDED] Trauma... yes, in a manner of speaking.
GID00078581	[FAILED] No... sometimes it simply wakes voices up.
GID00078582	[SUCCEEDED] That's the easy explanation, the one humans use. Pre-War technology, as if it's the cause of all ills, mind and body.
GID00078583	I needed to come out of the cage to protect Dog. From clever humans... like you.
GID00078584	[FAILED] Perhaps. Or maybe I was here all the time, watching. Waiting for you.
GID00078585	Dog... Dog has heard that before. Was there pretty lights? There... were things to pull? Hard to pull, but Dog did. And... a cage.
GID00078586	...and Dog was hungry there. Dog... was someone else there, with Dog. Then... then there was noise, then... lights... and streets... screamed.
GID00078587	...Dog doesn't want to go to cage. It's inside Dog now, Dog can see the cage, hear the noises. The way to casino... it'll hurt you. Inside.
GID00078588	Do you see these wounds of his, covering his skin...the bear trap on his arm? He placed his own hand in it.
GID00078589	The name he carved in his chest? To remind him of who he is, he inflicts pain on himself to silence me, when all I try to do... Hrr!
GID00078590	...he cuts, hurts, and tries to murder me out of him. He won't succeed. Just makes me angrier.
GID00078591	Dog is the beast, we simply change cages. Like the ones here.
GID00078592	Dog and I take turns in the cage... one steps out, the other goes back in.
GID00078593	Dog and I take turns in the cage... one steps out, the other goes back in. Now - what do you want?
GID00078594	Dog is listening.
GID00078595	Dog will crush you, snap your bones, make red everywhere.
GID00078596	[SUCCEEDED] Hnnh? Master? Don't want Master to be mad... what does Master want Dog to...
GID00078597	[FAILED] Dog tired of listening to you - put you in cage, piece by piece.
GID00078598	No. No, Dog, no...
GID00078599	...knows now. Voice was always small... Dog could have torn it apart, eaten it all this time, tear it...
GID00078600	...apart, Dog... we cannot be apart, you need if... hnnnh... hrrhhaharrrrr...
GID00078601	...Dog... Dog is... empty. The voice... Dog is hungrier than ever...
GID00078602	Dog... Dog doesn't have a... hnh. Here it is. Dog... Dog didn't know it was there. How did it get there?
GID00078603	Does Master want Dog to fetch someone? Dog will hunt down whoever you want, bring them here.
GID00078604	Master, Dog is here. What does Master want?
GID00078605	Yes, Master... Master sounds different, quieter. Master... Dog doesn't want to be in the cage any more. Dog will be good this time, Dog promises.
GID00078606	Yes, Master. Here, Dog sorry, Dog... just... just let Dog out of the cage. Don't want to be here any longer.
GID00078607	Now Dog speak. Now Dog not afraid. And... hungry. More hungry.
GID00078608	Dog will obey. Dog will stay here... for now.
GID00078609	After... after that, Dog find food... tear apart food, eat. Chase it down, can't run, feed. Finally, until Dog is full.
GID00078610	Yes, Master. Dog waited a long time... brought you many people. Dog will follow.
GID00078611	Already have a Dog with you... Dog will meet you at the Fountain. Maybe find food on the way.
GID00078612	Master, Dog waited a long time... brought you many people. If Dog finds more, will bring them to the Fountain, Dog promises.
GID00078613	Yes, Master. Dog hopes to see you soon.
GID00078614	Dog good at punching... hitting people with metal bear jaw until they go quiet.
GID00078615	Dog sometimes pick up club when thing need to hit is big, need to punch in many places.
GID00078616	Hard to pull things...? Dog has to pull very, very hard to... are we going there?
GID00078617	Dog not want to stay and pull things... hard to do... and cage there.
GID00078618	Taste like plastic and copper. Gas inside, in pockets, hssss when teeth sinks into them.
GID00078619	Master went away until you show up with him on your arm.
GID00078620	Don't know. Dog keep bringing people here.
GID00078621	Dog doesn't like to eat them always, sometimes so many. Keep stabbing Dog, cutting him.
GID00078622	Voice doesn't get mad when Dog feeds on the people here. Voice not like Ghost People, worried there are too many to eat, too many knives.
GID00078623	Started eating them because wouldn't go quiet when Dog smashed them with bear jaw. Only want one.
GID00078624	Got Dog angry, others kept cutting him and slicing him with knives when he tried to make one go quiet with teeth.
GID00078625	So Dog started crushing them, then when they stop twitching, then eats them. Then they not get back up with hssss-chkk noise, Dog not like that.
GID00078626	Dog can tell when they not yet dead... twitch a bit, make low noise, then noise when they get back up, listen.
GID00078627	Dog doesn't like to eat them always, sometimes so many.
GID00078628	Dog fetches. Dragged you here... Dog thinks. You not struggle like others. Trap makes you sleep, make your voice go to cage.
GID00078629	Dog doing what he was told. Tried to catch as many as he can, can eat the others.
GID00078630	No eat you, though. Master talk through you, like voice inside Dog. Dog missed hearing Master, not hear Master for long time.
GID00078631	Might find way back if Master lets you go. If he not want you to go, he makes head red spray. Then Dog has to find another one.
GID00078632	To leave...? Go through gate, walk. Hard to find way, Dog can do it, too hard for most to come here. Why so quiet in streets.
GID00078633	Nrrrrrrh... rhhhhharrhhh!
GID00078634	[SUCCEEDED]Hnnh? Master? Don't want Master to be mad... what does Master want Dog to...
GID00078635	[FAILED] No... Dog no listen to you, no listen to your voice anymore - will tear you apart, feed on you.
GID00078636	[SUCCEEDED] Master? Master... Dog... Dog is listening.
GID00078637	[FAILED] No... no, you put Dog here, you keep him here! Like other cages you put Dog in!
GID00078638	If... if other voice comes out... Dog... Dog won't wake up. Dog doesn't want to sleep, please don't make him...
GID00078639	...go to sleep. Good. Yes... make him sleep. Please...
GID00078640	...don't make me go to sleep. I... Dog is tired. Dog is tired, can't... keep eyes open. Sleep... Dog needs to sleep.
GID00078641	Dog... Dog never thought of the voice as... small. As something he could hold...
GID00078642	...on for much longer. What are you doing? What...
GID00078643	...do you want Dog to do? Voice is small now, Dog... Dog could... Dog choke the voice, crush it into red mash.
GID00078644	Dog is sorry, so sorry, didn't want to, but...
GID00078645	...it's time for you to realize who's in control here. First, we tear you apart - then this casino, and the Old Man with it.
GID00078646	Yes, Dog can do that. Dog hopes to see you soon.
GID00078647	...do this? Yes, he can. You caused this - coddled him, protected him, now I'm going to have to take control from...
GID00078648	...you, you need to go, run. Dog is going to burn voice... burn voice out, burn it away.
GID00078649	...and Dog looks just like me. You've hurt yourself. Inside. Do you see now, see...
GID00078650	...in the water. Dog understands now. Dog knows what happened.
GID00078651	He's right. If you merge us, then... I... we... or whatever we become... we can't help you when you reach whatever's at the Sierra Madre's end.
GID00078652	And Dog... Dog doesn't want to unremember you, may forget you.
GID00078653	We will forget almost all that has happened here. You'll be alone - at the Old Man's mercy. Like Dog. Like me.
GID00078654	...to stop you. You think your pull is stronger than mine? No... no, I've minded Dog, protected him far longer than you ever have. He won't...
GID00078655	...listen to you. If Master sent you, Dog is listening.
GID00078656	...him, just as I do. Do you understand now? Do you understand why I have to take control? He...
GID00078657	...why keep hurting self, voice keeps... telling Dog to do things. Dog just wants voice to go away... away.
GID00078658	...too late. Too late for us... too late for you to do anything but...
GID00078659	...listen to you. Your voice... Dog will listen to you.
GID00078660	Dog is tired of voice inside, tired of being in another cage, again. Try to...
GID00078661	...kill this human, Dog. Kill them. If this casino is destroyed, good, it'll kill the Old Man, too, the one who...
GID00078662	...shouts at Dog, the voice shouts, and to stop the voice, Dog needs to burn it out.
GID00078663	You did it. You... I don't feel him struggling anymore... I'm in pain, and... I hate to say it, I'm starving, but... I'm not fighting him.
GID00078664	All I wanted was him to listen to me, take care of him, keep him from hurting himself...
GID00078665	Now I can. One day, when he's ready, I'll let him out. When we... understand each other.
GID00078666	Dog can't remember. Don't want to go, can't make him stay there.
GID00078667	[SUCCEEDED] The lights were pretty. In the sky. Pointed at casino. And the casino opened up.
GID00078668	[FAILED] Uh-uh. Dog... Dog wants to stop talking now.
GID00078669	Maybe. Not sure you could find way back once leave. Dog has to smell and hunt for path back here sometimes... Cloud keep moving.
GID00078670	It okay... no one ever leave except Dog... and Dog not want to leave. You here until Master lets you go.
GID00078671	[SUCCEEDED] Dog can see the voice. Looks just like Dog...
GID00078672	[FAILED] Dog... Dog does not understand. Voice? The other voice? What do you want Dog to do.
GID00078673	If Dog... if Dog goes into the water... Dog can't help if Master gets mad. You were nice to Dog, Dog wants to help.
GID00078674	Dog doesn't want to die. But the voice keeps shouting, and...
GID00078675	Dog tried to shut it out, tried to hurt self enough to make it...
GID00078676	...quiet. Shhhhh, Dog. Let me handle this. I'll let you feed on this human when we're done.
GID00078677	No... if you rip their arms off... or legs, mask people stay down. Easier to rip off legs and arms when they fall on ground, just keep hitting them.
GID00078678	If can't make them fall down and rip off legs, make them ash. Saw one caught in electric sparks so much, he turn into burnt pile. Not get back up.
GID00078679	Dog knows... please... help Dog end the voice, Dog just wants it to go away. Dog...
GID00078680	...and I have more in common than we know. Soon, you'll be inside Dog, just as I am.
GID00078681	Dog tried. Just hard... hard to hear over voice sometimes... so loud... pain... pain...
GID00078682	...won't shut me out, Dog. It won't silence me. This human... both of them, they mean to...
GID00078683	...help Dog, please. Please.
GID00078684	Lou... ten... ant? Long ago. Smart. Gave us all things to do. Like watch. And kill. Gone now.
GID00078685	Miss Lou. Miss the Base. Miss the Church. Don't like here. Don't want to talk about it any more, makes head hurt.
GID00078686	[SUCCEEDED] Dism... disin... chop legs off while stand up, eat when fall down. If not that, make them electric ash.
GID00078687	[FAILED] All make them stay down. Most of time.
GID00078688	[SUCCEEDED]You... were kind to Dog. Dog will listen... Dog is glad you came...
GID00078689	[SUCCEEDED] Master? Master, Dog hoped you come, voice... voice is going...
GID00078690	[FAILED] No... Dog is my creature, and he's more than enough to end you here and now.
GID00078691	Dog knows where to hit them, make them stay down... base of neck, lower back, hit it hard enough, life snaps out of them.
GID00078692	Dog can... see where back of collar is? Follow down, to lower back - hit neck, middle back, right on spine, crack. Then they not get back up.
GID00078693	Dog hits them, then Dog eats them... easier to make quiet twice that way.
GID00078694	No... Dog no listen to you, no listen to your voice anymore - will tear you apart, feed on you.
GID00078695	Dog put his hand in it, hurts. Made the voice go away, now can't get it off. Don't want it off, hurt keeps voice sleeping... bleeding.
GID00078696	It also keeps others quiet, too. Dog hits them with metal bear teeth until their voices stop, makes Master's voice come back.
GID00078697	Here? Followed voice in air, then here... here as long as can remember. Don't like this place... hard to find things to eat sometimes.
GID00078698	Better than the cage. Dog doesn't like being locked up. Voice in air didn't say anything about a cage and nothing to eat.
GID00078699	Hurt self. Hurt makes the voice go away... it doesn't like pain.
GID00078700	Dog doesn't like pain, either, but keeps voice quiet, so Dog will hurt self until voice dies. Dog hurt self enough, voice go away, never come back.
GID00078701	Dog doesn't understand... too hungry, hard to hear words... Master, when can Dog feed.
GID00078702	If Dog was fed like last time, Dog would listen. If the feeding was quiet.
GID00078703	Maybe voice could make Dog stay, Dog not want to be in cage, Dog want to be free, find Master.
GID00078704	Nnnh... getting tired of hearing your orders. Dog's clawing at the cage, hungrier than usual.
GID00078705	You must need something, I can see it in your eyes. The Gala... of course. How could I forget?
GID00078706	If you want me to... heel... if you want Dog to obey, then he'll need to be fed, like last time.
GID00078707	Hnnh-hnn.
GID00078708	Yes, Master.
GID00078709	Nnnh-Hnnn.
GID00078710	Yes... no... don't know what the word means, everyone says the same, except the voice. The voice says it backward.
GID00078711	Dog is getting tired, Master. When can Dog eat?
GID00078712	Too much talking makes Dog's head hurt. Getting hungry.
GID00078713	Dog trapped here, too. This place not like West. Air like copper wire. Gut heavy, hurts, beeps sometimes.
GID00078714	Back West... in bone cities... Dog wore a collar on wrist, turned him into color of ground, turned him into color of sky.
GID00078715	Dog hears many voices... one in air. The... other one. And Master. Master is the nicest. Gets mean, mad sometimes. But lets Dog feed.
GID00078716	Master was quiet for a long time until Dog heard him on your arm... did you eat him? Dog gets hungry, too. Being hungry makes the voice... mad.
GID00078717	Dog eats whatever he can catch. Sometimes they run, but Dog is strong, moves fast.
GID00078718	Sometimes... makes voice mad when I eat... Master doesn't mind.
GID00078719	Is true. Dog wore it right on his hand, where bear trap is now... he thinks.
GID00078720	When put it on, hard to see. Hard to see... Dog was told not to be seen then. Same as now, except different.
GID00078721	Dog and others... had to hide in Base. And Church. The Master was there. Master was... spoke like many people. Smart. Like Lou-Lieutenant.
GID00078722	Dog misses the Church. When got dark, no people, Dog could sit on floor and look up at ceiling. Could... take off wrist-collar then.
GID00078723	All gone. All gone. It better now that found new Master.
GID00078724	New Master tells Dog what to do, rewards Dog, like old Master. Dog goes get people, drag them here... like vat. Dog knows how to do that.
GID00078725	If people fight, Dog hit them until they stop. And if more than one, Dog can eat them, so Dog hunts hard for as many as he can find.
GID00078726	Don't know where other voice come from. Wish would go away. Always trying to stop Dog, caging Dog.
GID00078727	Voice started talking not long ago, Dog think... was always there. Start talking when Master showed up? Making Dog sleep, go to cage.
GID00078728	Voice hates Master. It okay... voice always hide when Master around, go quiet, watch Master as he does things. Voice scared of Master, Dog thinks.
GID00078729	Master always feed Dog if not in cage. Master lets Dog do what Dog wants. Not like other voice in cage. Always mad with Dog, shouting at him.
GID00078730	He takes care of Dog. He tells Dog what to do. Told Dog to come here, put collars on people.
GID00078731	Sometimes people fight. Dog holds them until they go quiet, don't make any noise. If collars don't fit or go too quiet... find others for Master.
GID00078732	Master makes the other voice go away - the other voice hates Master, Dog can feel it. Master's voice is like pain, protects Dog.
GID00078733	Lost it. Got hungry. Made the other voice mad, madder than it ever was, mad enough to lock Dog up.
GID00078734	Other voice... don't wake him up. When voice wakes up, Dog goes to sleep and voice climbs up in Dog's head.
GID00078735	The voice puts Dog in places... puts him in cages and locks him in.
GID00078736	Sometimes when Dog gets tired. Or eats too much, gets full. Sometimes... when Dog goes to the cage... then voice wakes up.
GID00078737	The voice locks Dog in when it comes up, always trying to keep Dog from food. Voice did it at the cage where you found me. Then Master came.
GID00078738	Dog is better at the baser instincts than I... I merely have the brain for it.
GID00078739	His sinew and muscle are difficult to move consciously... he's always hungry, clumsy, heavy.
GID00078740	Of course I know. Even if I don't see it happen - down in the cage, I hear echoes of the footfalls, the click of the collars.
GID00078741	Every time I see one of you I know exactly how you got here - you couldn't help yourselves, anymore than Dog can help himself.
GID00078742	You heard the voice, the promise, and then you walked right into one of the Old Man's traps. Then... then Dog comes for you, drags you here.
GID00078743	You can lead me to water... no, being trapped in this courtyard while lights are flashing and sirens are screaming...
GID00078744	I can survive one or two of the inhabitants... more than that, even Dog would have to work to keep full without being carved to pieces.
GID00078745	And the gate here... if it somehow got locked, it'd be the holding cell at the Police Station again, except with no way out.
GID00078746	Really... an amusing thought.
GID00078747	If you needed his teeth to devour those metal switches, chew up the diagram, then let him out.
GID00078748	There's a sequence, precise and clear as a knife, that must be followed. And it requires more than instinct to operate.
GID00078749	No, you need me, here - out of the cage.
GID00078750	The Gala Event is the way to bring the Old Man out. He won't show himself until the casino doors are open.
GID00078751	So triggering the Event is key... and the key. The question becomes... can we trust each other to do this? We'll see.
GID00078752	If we go there, you'll have to give me control. If you bring Dog out, then... I'll make sure you pay in blood.
GID00078753	Things here... are... under control. Find the one that dragged us here, end him.
GID00078754	Dog understands... Dog has done... bad things, knows why voice was...
GID00078755	...furious with him. Tired of the anger. Thank you... Courier. Even if it's only for minutes before the Sierra Madre kills us all, then...
GID00078756	...Dog hopes you find a way to save self, like you help Dog, and...
GID00078757	...when you meet him, find a way to save yourself, as you tried to save us. Otherwise, I'll be upset with you.
GID00078758	Dog understands. Need help, need Dog in case.
GID00078759	Of course. You... we might not get through this, otherwise. Need to survive, no matter what the cost. Now... now...
GID00078760	You were there all the time...
GID00078761	...all the time, you were there, and so close...
GID00078762	...together.
GID00078763	Who... who are you? What is this place?
GID00078764	I feel as if I've woken up.
GID00078765	I don't know you, yet I feel like I do, and a feeling of... gratitude. I... forgive me, I... I'm wounded. This chain... this bear trap on my arm...
GID00078766	...how did I even get this far with these wounds? The pain is excruciating, I... I need to rest for a moment.
GID00078767	That... that was not the answer I was expecting.
GID00078768	Thank you... for whatever you have done. I will remain here, need to get my strength back.
GID00078769	[SUCCEEDED] Master? Master, Dog hoped you would come, voice... voice is going...
GID00078770	[FAILED] Dog... Dog wants to, Dog does, but...
GID00078771	[SUCCEEDED] You think you can figure out what to... hnh. Of course you can.
GID00078772	I'll stand at my post. Once you trigger the event... well, we'll see who makes it to the Sierra Madre.
GID00078773	[FAILED] No... you can barely give me instructions, let alone order Dog. Bark your orders somewhere else.
GID00078774	It always does... makes him sleepier. Weaker. Easier to keep out of trouble. As for the type of food...
GID00078775	Make sure it isn't struggling, if you can. It's hard enough to choke down half of what I suspect he eats. And make sure it's not a bomb collar.
GID00078776	All right... for a moment there, I thought... hnh. I'll wait here then, come back when you've found a carcass. Or three.
GID00078777	More? Don't push your luck.
GID00078778	You're a brave one. Sure you're ready for the answers?
GID00078779	Dog might know more, you should ask him. Beware the answer, because I think Dog got hungry, he couldn't help himself.
GID00078780	I tried, I always try, and he... he keeps giving in.
GID00078781	All it takes is the right... command. Whenever Dog hears the... his Master giving orders, I go back in the cage.
GID00078782	So that leash on your wrist... and the one on your neck. I won't truly be free to... express myself until every trace of that voice is destroyed.
GID00078783	Still... if you ever want to speak to me, bark my audio log at him, the one in the police station. That'll call me out.
GID00078784	Orders - for me. This should be good.
GID00078785	It's close. Closer than I'd like... Dog's been into things, needs to think before he eats, chew before he swallows. He's... eager that way.
GID00078786	Now the collar's a part of me. Inside. I can feel its electronic heartbeat, clicking and burning down below... like before.
GID00078787	It was cold and heavy before going in the cage... now you're here, and it's pulling and kicking again, tugging like a leash. Interesting.
GID00078788	No... why did I lock him in the cage. I locked him in because I could feel him... getting hungry again. There wasn't much time.
GID00078789	If Dog roams, he gets into trouble... eats things he shouldn't, listens to others he shouldn't... so he's safer in here. We're safer in here.
GID00078790	I hoped if I locked him in here... the one he obeys would come for him. Instead, I get you.
GID00078791	No... no, I don't think so. Even in here, I have more control than you do.
GID00078792	I'm not leaving until the one who controls the collars shows... not his voice, not his hand, not his lackey... him.
GID00078793	And when he comes to see me, we'll settle things. So go on, go back to your master, tell him I'm waiting for him. Dog may follow him - I won't.
GID00078794	Don't play stupid, I already have to mind one child. You must have figured it out by now.
GID00078795	The Old Man obsessed with the Sierra Madre... riddled with greed. Hoped you might be him when I woke up. All you are is his hand...
GID00078796	...you're the same kind of greed. Followed the radio, the broadcast, and now you're here, all confused. Not for long. You'll figure it out.
GID00078797	Really. Yet it led you here, to me. And now you're here, and it's burning a hole in my guts. Maybe it's crying for its owner.
GID00078798	They... detach. When segmented, they look like nothing more than metallic Radscorpions... and if they're attached to neck flesh, warm, red...
GID00078799	Dog doesn't care what's on the body he's crushing in his hands, he'll mangle it, twist it, make it fit until he's full.
GID00078800	Dog can't help himself... hungry... greedy. And now the collar's inside, alive again. And we're trapped here until it goes cold.
GID00078801	As if I had a choice. Sometimes instinct takes over, and that's when I go into the cage. It's like curiosity that way.
GID00078802	After all, you wouldn't have put that collar on by choice... perhaps it was your curiosity that caused that hand to close on your neck.
GID00078803	Of course I know. Even if I don't see it happen - down in the cage, I hear echoes of the footfalls, the click of the collars.
GID00078804	Every time I see one of you, I know exactly how you got here - you couldn't help yourselves, anymore than Dog can help himself.
GID00078805	You heard the voice, the promise, and then you walked right into one of the Old Man's traps. Then... then Dog comes for you, drags you here.
GID00078806	You're not him anymore than I'm Dog. But that collar around your neck...
GID00078807	...you're an extension of the Old Man's grasp, clumsy, perhaps, but a tool, yes. And once you get acclimated to the Sierra Madre...
GID00078808	...then you'll feel the same overpowering hunger the Old Man does. And then you'll be him, not just his hand.
GID00078809	Elijah. Human, weak like all of you are. Feeling age circling him like starved dogs, howling for blood.
GID00078810	To me, he reeks of age and failure. And madness. To me, he is simply the "Old Man." To Dog, he is "Master." His name, meaningless.
GID00078811	Running out of years, hopes and dreams running through his withered hands like sand from the Big Empty... and scorched by the sun.
GID00078812	Me? You think I want to haul bodies around the wastes like a Brahmin at the whip? No, Dog does it, when the Old Man says fetch, Dog fetches.
GID00078813	You were in a man-trap, and Dog made his rounds, and dragged you here. When, I don't know. But... it must have been... recent. Before the cage.
GID00078814	Of course you can't. This cage is locked tight... from you and the Old Man.
GID00078815	The way back doesn't matter... try to leave, try to disobey, and your collar ends the journey faster than you can say, "begin again."
GID00078816	You're clever, you'd be able to find a way back if you left the Villa. Dog can... I can find the way back, if "back" is where I even wanted to go.
GID00078817	Until the Old Man lets you go, you're going nowhere. This beautiful paradise, with all its toxins and death... it's home.
GID00078818	I don't remember you... that isn't surprising. What is... is that it was when Dog was out of his cage... free, hungry.
GID00078819	He knows not to eat anything he catches in the traps... after that, however... so he dragged you here, you got spared.
GID00078820	Dog must have fed after you arrived... once he was fed, that allowed me out of the cage, and put him inside. Do you remember how long you were out?
GID00078821	Must have already been in the cage... already had the collar in me. You're lucky Dog didn't devour you... otherwise, we'd be closer than we are now.
GID00078822	The Old Man... this "Elijah," tried to hold the sun in his hands, arrogance, was cast down for it. Icarus' crime was to fly too high, Elijah...
GID00078823	Elijah wanted to bring the sun down to him. Hnh! Arrogance.
GID00078824	Heard the call of the Sierra Madre, just like you did... exactly the same way.
GID00078825	Finds out it's more than a story, comes to this shining poisonous grail, this jewel of the desert.
GID00078826	Dog knows him more than I do. Dog's always nodding, always obeying him, because he's weak and hungry and greedy for master's affection.
GID00078827	Oh, I have the key, always did. Hid it on the chain behind my neck before Dog came bursting out, eating everything he could.
GID00078828	Wanted to make sure whoever came to fetch Dog spoke to me first, got within reach. Instead... I get you.
GID00078829	Dog and I don't share... everything. What I know, he doesn't.
GID00078830	What he knows... what little he knows... I don't. For example, your arrival is a surprise. I wished that I could have remembered, I'm sure Dog knew.
GID00078831	And when he's feeding, well... I sometimes have to find out about it later. Now all there is to do is wait for my intended guest.
GID00078832	[SUCCEEDED] They were here when I arrived... so I made use of them, in a manner of speaking. More their... voices, really.
GID00078833	These collars... they don't just track us. You can eavesdrop on them as well. Tune to a frequency, and you can hear everything someone is saying.
GID00078834	So perhaps it's a good thing that Dog swallowed his collar. Anyone listening would find it difficult to hear past the... digestion.
GID00078835	[FAILED] I was afraid Dog would get lonely. The voices, as static and whispering as they are... are still company.
GID00078836	Then I still win. I'd rather die in this cell than have Dog follow him any longer, follow his orders, his commands, desperate for recognition.
GID00078837	The Old Man... he has the need to hold on, to the past, to the Madre... I'd rather be free, let go of this shell, than have it cage me any longer.
GID00078838	Dog? You're not talking to him now, are you? No, even if you could drag Dog out of his cage, you still couldn't get him out of this cage.
GID00078839	I put him here for a reason... if he could have escaped, he would have. So here he stays.
GID00078840	Yes, but Dog doesn't know that. We don't share everything. Sometimes it's a blessing... sometimes... it causes difficulties.
GID00078841	Now I think it's a blessing, it keeps you on that side of the cage. Now... you go fetch. Find your master, bring him here so we can talk.
GID00078842	Yes... you could. And once he was out, all starving and hungry... what do you think he would do then?
GID00078843	Be careful what cage you open, because he won't go back in it without a fight. He'll tear you apart, he won't care if it kills you both.
GID00078844	Dog... obeys. Yes. Why... do you have some means of contacting the Old Man?
GID00078845	You... don't play it. If you do, I'll find a way to get out of the cage, end you. I'll murder you, crush your arms and legs until...
GID00078846	They all wanted their freedom at first. Then... they realized they could get inside the Sierra Madre.
GID00078847	After that, their freedom wasn't important any more. They couldn't let go, just like the Old Man. So you say you want your freedom...
GID00078848	No... even if you feel that way, it won't last. You'll forget, get greed-blind, and you'll turn.
GID00078849	No... I don't trust you. Even if you're not working with him, you'll fall into the same trap he did.
GID00078850	You may think you can take your revenge... that'll change. You'll start thinking there's a way to have it all.
GID00078851	No! No, no, don't! I'll make you suffer for this, I promise you.
GID00078852	Although it may not matter... I suspect the Sierra Madre will be reward enough for ones like you.
GID00078853	No, you wouldn't. If you did, you won't escape this place alive. I'd shatter every one of your limbs to splinters and leave you here.
GID00078854	You think I'm afraid of your collar exploding, killing us? No, I'll leave you breathing, then keep walking until my collar goes cold.
GID00078855	I'll prop your broken body in view of the Sierra Madre so you can see what you came to steal... forever out of reach as you die.
GID00078856	Hnh. No... no, you're not. Even though Dog's more docile... easier to control.
GID00078857	You may regret this. This place... this place is where creatures like Dog can survive. The people that fill its streets...
GID00078858	He is as vicious, more vicious than them. His hunger can help you more than I can. When I am in control... this shell is difficult to... fight in.
GID00078859	[SUCCEEDED] Very good. Yes... it's another layer of white noise to ensure privacy. Unfortunately, it's also acted as a dinner bell for the residents.
GID00078860	As long as the holographic greeter outside is active, however, I can get by them... the Holograms fascinate them. Ghost-worship, perhaps.
GID00078861	[FAILED] Yes... interesting that. More like a dinner bell to some.
GID00078862	Prove it... how? Words are worthless.
GID00078863	Uh-huh. Master ordered it. "Take places." Then... Master went away. Left Dog... Dog in cage.
GID00078864	Casino open long time ago, not sure when... voice keeps putting Dog in cage. Haven't seen Master since, only hear voice on your arm and from walls.
GID00078865	I am not sure you belong here. No, you don't belong here.
GID00078866	Yet... you came this far. And I'm not interested in remaining here any longer. I'll unlock the cage.
GID00078867	And so... greed, practical or otherwise, has its day.
GID00078868	The... inhabitants of the Villa. They are difficult to kill. They need to be chopped apart, hacked on the ground... disintegrated, if you can.
GID00078869	They are difficult to kill... but not to devour. And Dog is always hungry.
GID00078870	If he is with you, when they fall, he will fall on them, end them. If I am with you... fighting will be far more difficult.
GID00078871	[SUCCEEDED] Very good. Yes... it's another layer of white noise to ensure privacy. Unfortunately, it's also acted as a dinner bell for the residents.
GID00078872	As long as the holographic greeter outside is active, however, I can get by them... the Holograms fascinate them. Ghost-worship, perhaps.
GID00078873	[FAILED] Yes... interesting that. More like a dinner bell to some.
GID00078874	Dog is afraid of me as long as the Master isn't around.
GID00078875	[SUCCEEDED] The "Master" - Elijah... reminds Dog of someone from long ago. His leader, commander. Commanders.
GID00078876	The Master was a strong personality... personalities as well. Dog is slavish, was conditioned to serve the Master until death.
GID00078877	The Old Man... Elijah merely came along and opened that door in Dog's mind. Now Dog does whatever the Old Man wants.
GID00078878	[FAILED] Habit. Conditioning. It doesn't matter.
GID00078879	Mad? Mad doesn't even begin to describe... there's not a word for the hate I feel inside. It's consuming... twists every thought to red.
GID00078880	After all that's laid ruin to the world... again and again, I thought at last, we could be free... thought Dog could be free.
GID00078881	No... no, the world's always got another cage, waiting, keeping everything you want... just out of reach.
GID00078882	Gather others, drag them here... fetch, like an animal... and hurt them if they resist.
GID00078883	Dog doesn't even blink, even hear their cries when he's twisted their arms full circle... fragile things, screaming on the ground...
GID00078884	To listen to him... commanding Dog... to hurt others... and Dog just nods, eager and willing to serve.
GID00078885	Do anything? Me... me, Dog puts in the cage, hurts himself to try and drown out my voice, when all I want to do...
GID00078886	...aah... hrrr, never mind, useless. Finally had to start fighting back, screaming on my own. Had to take matters into my own hands, lock Dog up.
GID00078887	[SUCCEEDED] I've watched over Dog for so long. Tried to stop him from... hurting others, killing others, quiet that mindless howling instinct of his.
GID00078888	He doesn't understand, he has the brain of a child... he knows when he does wrong, he just can't help himself.
GID00078889	[FAILED] No... because all I need to do is bide my time. I'll settle this... myself, as I always planned.
GID00078890	He's my brother - kin. Without him, I wouldn't exist. Maybe I was nothing more than his conscience, trying to rein him in. Useless.
GID00078891	I... I just need him to show restraint, let go of the needs, the hungers. Ease the burden... just once, so I can have my thoughts to myself.
GID00078892	The instinct is stronger than me. Dog is stronger than me. He's just a child... he knows when he does wrong, he just can't help himself.
GID00078893	I don't know when I first spoke, or when I first started thinking for myself, it was so long ago. I... slept for a long time... before...
GID00078894	...I want to believe I was the one in control. Once. I don't know anymore. Then Dog got a new Master. A new voice. And I woke up, to protect him.
GID00078895	[SUCCEEDED] Trauma... yes, in a manner of speaking.
GID00078896	[FAILED] No... sometimes it simply wakes voices up.
GID00078897	Heard the call of the Sierra Madre, just like you did... exactly the same way.
GID00078898	Finds out it's more than a story, comes to this shining poisonous grail, this jewel of the desert.
GID00078899	Dog knows him more than I do. Dog's always nodding, always obeying him, because he's weak and hungry and greedy for master's affection.
GID00078900	Ask him. Or better, don't. It wouldn't be an interesting conversation, much like this one.
GID00078901	He did, yes. A team did, with collars linked just like yours. Did he tell you everything, or just about the pretty lights?
GID00078902	There was more. Only he truly recalls, though... and should. I won't spoil it for you, especially when we have more... pressing matters.
GID00078903	Very good. As for the casino... yes, it did.
GID00078904	Because something got left inside. The Old Man... Elijah.
GID00078905	He's trapped in there. As I hoped he would be.
GID00078906	Because he couldn't. As soon as he made his way into the casino, it sealed up...
GID00078907	...and the casino's construction allowed me an opportunity to escape. The collars... unhooked. I... was free.
GID00078908	No... I saw to that...
GID00078909	It should have... the casino's construction is unusual. Signals in there get... scrambled, some alloy in the architecture... I don't know.
GID00078910	I wasn't sure until the collars de-activated that I had won. Trapped him in his cage. Dog... I... could be free.
GID00078911	Dog happened. When the collars came off... he got... hungry. And all my work, all my effort... wasted because of his hunger, his greed.
GID00078912	Ask Dog. It doesn't matter... it's in the past, as much as I try to forget it, it's always... with us.
GID00078913	[SUCCEEDED] Interesting... so it seems you have another link we don't. And... you're to blame for this.
GID00078914	Yes... he wears a Pip-Boy on his wrist, just as you do. If he's feeding commands and signals, then I would be careful.
GID00078915	He's most likely installed a contingency switch in the Pip-Boy. If the signal gets cut off, or you try and remove it... well, then we'll all die.
GID00078916	[FAILED] That I don't know. The collars came back to life... I'm not sure how.
GID00078917	I felt it when you woke me up... that kicking in my gut, the collar was coiled with a charge again, like a snake.
GID00078918	Really. As much hatred as I hold for him, he is much, much smarter than many I've met... no offense meant, of course.
GID00078919	He seems to not only understand the workings of Pre-War tech, he seems to breathe it. And... these collars, commandeering your Pip-Boy...
GID00078920	Are the marks of someone who makes mistakes - but he's not leaving much to chance when it comes to ensuring our compliance.
GID00078921	No... this time is different. The key is different.
GID00078922	Maybe it's familiar, comfortable. Practice makes perfect.
GID00078923	And as much as it bruises my ego, some things require... brute strength. In the right combination.
GID00078924	Besides, none of your assembled band of thieves look able to rip a 200 year rusted power switch down like a machete to fire up an entire town.
GID00078925	[SUCCEEDED] Hmm... Hrrr... That's the easy explanation, the one humans use. Pre-War technology, as if it's the cause of all ills, mind and body.
GID00078926	I needed to come out of the cage to protect Dog. From clever humans... like you.
GID00078927	[FAILED] Perhaps. Or maybe I was here all the time, watching. Waiting for you.
GID00078928	I do. And after you threw me in the cage at the Police Station, I have no intention of telling you.
GID00078929	I do... the diagram there tells me what I need to know.
GID00078930	This Villa was built to decay, but parts... parts were well-defended, indeed. There was a method in the layout, you can... see it.
GID00078931	The terminal outside... one of those means this place was designed... properly. No, if locked, it could hold others out... and even Dog inside.
GID00078932	You're right... but trust? Trust is such a... harsh word. I prefer... mutual need. It's more honest.
GID00078933	No, I can help you. These wiring diagrams... I know how to operate the switches in sequence to make fire appear in the sky.
GID00078934	I... we just need to make sure that Dog doesn't surface before that happens. To do that... he'll need to be fed. That makes him stay in the Cage.
GID00078935	Dog has torn apart a number of the inhabitants of this town... while he doesn't prefer them to... other flesh... it'll do for the time being.
GID00078936	Find some of the inhabitants... it'll require some hunting on your part. Kill them, take some of the remains inside them, bring it back here.
GID00078937	They're not easy to kill. But... I have faith in you, and the beast must be fed if you want him to stay in this cage.
GID00078938	No, you'll throw me in the cage when you need to, just like at the Police Station. Trust you? No... you've made trust... difficult.
GID00078939	I'm not staying here and doing what you "order" me to do. Not again... and the sequence here? Just see if Dog can figure it out on his own.
GID00078940	All right... for a moment there, I thought... hnh. I'll wait here then, come back when you've found meat from two of the bodies.
GID00078941	Two chunks of meat from their bodies should be enough. Hunt... quietly, so as not to draw more here.
GID00078942	If you don't... then I can't guarantee I'll remain in control long enough to help you. It is... your choice.
GID00078943	[SUCCEEDED] You think you can figure out what to... hnh. Of course you can.
GID00078944	I'll stand at my post. Once you trigger the event... well, we'll see who makes it to the Sierra Madre.
GID00078945	[FAILED] No... you can barely give me instructions, let alone order Dog. Bark your orders somewhere else.
GID00078946	Really. And why is that? Dog is much more... docile. Obedient.
GID00078947	So you want me to listen. To obey. No... I can't. Because Dog wouldn't let me. I can already feel him clawing at me.
GID00078948	If you want me to remain, then I'll need to stay aware... enough to operate the switches properly.
GID00078949	I... we just need to make sure that Dog doesn't surface before that happens. To do that... he'll need to be fed. That makes him stay in the Cage.
GID00078950	And what would that gain you? Are you so eager to slice off your hand to spite your arm?
GID00078951	Pretty circle on machine, all glowing.
GID00078952	Those machines feed on Sierra Madre Chips. There's codes that unlock other things, too.
GID00078953	I... he's asleep. Finally. Shhhhhh.
GID00078954	Dog... all I wanted was for you to listen to me, let me care for you. Keep you from hurting yourself...
GID00078955	Now I can. And one day, when you're ready, I'll let you out. When you're calm, and we... understand each other.
GID00078956	And we're at peace, you and I, mind and instinct. Then the world will be ready for us.
GID00078957	Hello? Voice? You there? It's Dog......Dog can hear himself. Voice is... is in cage? Locked.
GID00078958	Now Dog speak. Now Dog not afraid. And... hungry. More hungry.
GID00078959	Dog find food... tear apart food, eat. Chase it down, can't run, feed. Finally, until Dog is full.
GID00078960	What is this place?
GID00078961	Feel strange, like... sleeping. On my neck, is this... a chain? I... what's carved on my chest?
GID00078962	"God." No... not God. Something in reverse... hnh. Was that one of them...?
GID00078963	Should rest, get my strength back... then explore this place, see what it holds.
GID00078964	...going to make casino burn, no more being...
GID00078965	...back in the cage. Stop what you're doing, we can...
GID00078966	...can hear you now. Not much longer, not...
GID00078967	...listening to me. Tired of being your minder, tired...
GID00078968	...of putting Dog to sleep, he wakes up in cage, hungry, Dog wants...
GID00078969	...to protect you, always wanted to protect you, the reason I have to take control is...
GID00078970	...Master. Master set me free, Dog needs to...
GID00078971	...listen to me. If you do this, we both...
GID00078972	...die. Dog wants to die. Don't care anymore, tired of you, tired of place. Master will...
GID00078973	...help us. Please let me help us. If you don't, then you're...
GID00078974	Good, well done... now, for the festivities, and your parts in all this.
GID00078975	The owner of the Sierra Madre... for whatever reason... keyed the Grand Opening to the Gala Event itself.
GID00078976	It needs to be fired off in order for the casino doors to open. As I've discovered, one person can't do it.
GID00078977	So, get your team in position indicated on your Pip-Boy, then trigger it properly.
GID00078978	You're so close now, don't let me down. Otherwise, I'll have to rely on the next team.
GID00078979	This gate to the Sierra Madre's sealed, locked. For now. Do as I say, and it won't be locked for much longer.
GID00078980	Damn speakers at end of hall - red light means they're shielded. Must be a way to shut them off somewhere else.
GID00078981	Outside, you may notice your vision'll pulse, get dizzy. It's the Cloud. Eats your insides, slowly. Too much exposure, death.
GID00078982	Get the mute down the elevator and into the Manual Override Chamber.
GID00078983	I can hear the event firing off. Now get to the main gate of the Sierra Madre, quickly.
GID00078984	Get there soon or the doors will seal, and you'll be trapped outside.
GID00078985	Get there soon or the doors will seal, and you'll be trapped outside.
GID00078986	You're at the Ghoul's Gala area... now, make him stay.
GID00078987	You're at one of the Gala locations, you'll need to bring the mutant here. Only he has the strength to operate the levers, I've found.
GID00078988	The bell tower. That's where you'll trigger the Gala Event. It's a ways up. I'm sure you'll find a way to climb up there.
GID00078989	And once you get near the top... look for a ladder. It's easy to miss.
GID00078990	And once you get near the top... look for a ladder. It's easy to miss.
GID00078991	Watch out for the Villa inhabitants, they're... difficult to kill unless you chop them apart... if you can, blow them up or disintegrate them.
GID00078992	Picking up an emitter signature - watch for security Holograms, dangerous. Don't shoot them - attacking them is useless.
GID00078993	Villa's comm speakers have aged poorly, like the Madre. Pre-War junk. The speakers emit a signal that'll set off your collar if you stay too long.
GID00078994	There are damaged speakers, and shielded ones... the damaged ones you can destroy at range - don't get close, you can't switch them off like a radio.
GID00078995	That's the way out - after you break into the Sierra Madre's vault. Try to leave, I'll set off your collar.
GID00078996	Don't go through the gate to Puesta del Sol yet - gather the others first.
GID00078997	Picking up signals near your location. Detonators. Watch for traps.
GID00078998	Leave the Salida del Sol gate alone. You're not done with the Villa yet, so don't stray.
GID00078999	There - the Switching Station. That's where you'll need to bring the mute.
GID00079000	You've gotten one of the floors re-established, good... accessing the music archives now. Two more to go.
GID00079001	Oh... it seems the casino has uninvited guests... the Villa inhabitants were pounding at the doors - now they've found a way inside.
GID00079002	Deal with them - and don't try and leave yourself, or I'll let the collar do its work.
GID00079003	Oh... it seems the casino has uninvited guests... the Villa inhabitants were pounding at the doors - now they've found a way inside.
GID00079004	Deal with them - and don't try and leave yourself, or I'll let the collar do its work.
GID00079005	Another fragment... good. Almost have the entirety of what I need from the music archives.
GID00079006	Once you have the last fragment, you can thread the archives together at the main floor terminal.
GID00079007	Once you have the last fragment, you can thread the archives together at the main floor terminal.
GID00079008	You have the last fragment, that is all I need. Now...
GID00079009	Go to the main lobby terminal, thread the music sequence together.
GID00079010	Now... back to the Suites. And we'll sing the lock open.
GID00079011	Ghosts... they fill the Villa. More in the Casino... much more.
GID00079012	They carry out the functions the dead once did. They cannot be harmed... they only perform the same rote tasks until their power dies.
GID00079013	They are of no consequence - except for the Security Holograms, the ones with the silhouettes of the armored Sierra Madre guards.
GID00079014	Most Holograms perform specific functions. The Security Holograms, ever since the bombs fell, now perform their function.
GID00079015	They will kill anyone they detect. They are immune to guns, weapons, EMPs... even energy weapons. Still, they have limitations.
GID00079016	Their design limits their field of view, enough to avoid detection.
GID00079017	Each has an emitter - destroy or disable it, and they cease to be a threat.
GID00079018	Still... at least they still work as intended. Other technology here is more of a threat to you... notably, the Villa's radios and speakers.
GID00079019	Someone who followed the call of the Sierra Madre, just as you did. Now that I've found it's more than a story... I intend to take what's inside.
GID00079020	Maybe that's why you came. Why you followed the Pip-Boy here... and straight into one of my traps. Now, this is your reward.
GID00079021	Confused? Don't be. I'm commandeering the hologram technology of the Villa.
GID00079022	Numbers, equations, circuits... all can be controlled, provided there's a connection, and the knowledge to use it.
GID00079023	This Villa, the casino... a treasure trove of such devices. The Holograms included.
GID00079024	One is a trusted ally... obedient, collar or no, although the collar helps. The other two... well, we'll have to see what the traps caught.
GID00079025	The Cloud is what blankets the sky here... you may smell it in the air, copper and sulfur... burns the lungs and seeps into the skin.
GID00079026	As for its origins... I am not certain. Pre-War industrial pollutants... something in the Sierra Madre structure...
GID00079027	It is unique across the wasteland... and deadly. It has kept this place preserved since the Great War.
GID00079028	Assembly stations. Schematics are stored within... dispensers with unlock codes.
GID00079029	They use the Chips scattered around as batteries... alloys and raw material embedded in the shell.
GID00079030	They resemble the vending machines of the Mojave, but they are crafting devices of tremendous versatility. Once an Old World convenience, now...
GID00079031	...now, they are a means of survival. Use the Chips to power them. Select from the holographic display, the device will assemble it.
GID00079032	I've unlocked the West and East gates to Puesta del Sol and Salida del Sol...
GID00079033	...now that you've survived the Villa, I need to get to my position, you don't need me to hold your hand anymore.
GID00079034	I'll keep monitoring you via the transceivers through the Villa... if I need to offer guidance, I will.
GID00079035	A display of lights, fireworks... music in the streets, a Pre-War festival to mark the casino's opening. The bombs struck first.
GID00079036	It is of no consequence, only firing the event is - get the three in position, then travel to your position in Salida del Sol and trigger the Gala.
GID00079037	After that, the real work begins.
GID00079038	That is for me to know. You get that far... you'll see for yourself.
GID00079039	I do not know. A Pre-War icon, perhaps. It is of no consequence aside from being a circuit I can utilize.
GID00079040	Hmm! Get here? You walked into one of my traps in the Mojave... following the Sierra Madre signal. Now, you're here, with that collar on your neck.
GID00079041	When you came into the bunker, you saw a victim, their head blown off for disobedience.
GID00079042	The city is filled with other stories, many such stories. Is "no" your choice?
GID00079043	I'd suggest taking the FEV reject to his position first... although you may need his brutality and strength elsewhere first.
GID00079044	As easy as the Villa was to navigate... the outlying areas of the Villa are far more dangerous, thicker with the Ghost People, traps, and toxins.
GID00079045	Use your team as I use you... listen to your collar, watch where you step. You're no use to me dead.
GID00079046	Perhaps you think this is a simple robbery. A cheap casino heist.
GID00079047	No... this is a heist of the centuries. We're not plundering the Sierra Madre - we're plundering history, taking from the Old World itself.
GID00079048	It won't let its secrets go easily... not without a fight. I wouldn't expect anything less.
GID00079049	It's like that Pip-Boy on your wrist, except filled with explosives. A little radio of the Old World, just needed some tuning.
GID00079050	Do what I say, and the collar won't go off... refuse, try and run, disobey me? I'll kill you and find someone else.
GID00079051	There's no escape from here until I let you go. The sooner you accept your situation, the better.
GID00079052	That structure you see above the Fountain - the Sierra Madre Casino... you need to break inside. A... heist. Too many years in the making.
GID00079053	But to get inside, avoid its traps... you'll need to gather the team. As I've found, one cannot do it alone.
GID00079054	Around the Villa are three other collars like yours - Collar 8, 12, and 14. Find all three and get them here, to the Fountain. Then, we'll talk more.
GID00079055	And should you get any ideas about killing each other and taking the treasure of the Sierra Madre for yourself - a warning.
GID00079056	All your collars are linked... one of you dies, you all die. If that's what it takes to make you cooperate, so be it.
GID00079057	When you came into the bunker, you saw a victim, their head blown off for disobedience.
GID00079058	The city is filled with other stories, many such stories. Is "no" your choice?
GID00079059	Then you are of no use to me.
GID00079060	Anywhere sheltered from the Cloud... inside buildings, tunnels... any place not exposed to the outside air.
GID00079061	Anything the Cloud has touched has preserved it one way or another... but only the Holograms in the Villa truly remain.
GID00079062	Unfamiliar with the legend of the Sierra Madre? The casino exists. You are one of the few who look upon it.
GID00079063	Where you're standing is the Villa beneath the casino above. The wreckage... the Villa... lies in the shadow.
GID00079064	The Villa is a dumping ground of failed construction... Pre-War junk that has aged poorly.
GID00079065	I brought you here. There are mechanisms in place once the traps across the Mojave are sprung.
GID00079066	For now, your sole focus should be the Sierra Madre, and how to get inside. Until then, you won't leave alive.
GID00079067	Yes... the inhabitants... avoid them if you can, they are difficult to kill.
GID00079068	Whatever has created them, bullets, explosions, energy... it can make them inert for a time, then they seem to crawl back up, restored.
GID00079069	Perhaps it's the Cloud... perhaps something in their physiology.
GID00079070	It is the Cloud covering the Villa. The longer you are outside, the more its toxins seep into your system... through the lungs and the skin.
GID00079071	It will eat at you the longer you are outside... so wherever you go, move fast, or you'll soon find yourself too weak to move.
GID00079072	It is the Cloud that surrounds the Villa. It shouldn't prove lethal in the time you are here... prolonged exposure would be hazardous, however.
GID00079073	Fall asleep... and you will not wake up.
GID00079074	The Sierra Madre has many... defenses, means of screening guests for illicit or dangerous items. Your arrival here, weaponless, was not my intention.
GID00079075	The Casino, this Villa... it takes anything with even a trace of radioactivity, traces of unknown substances... and returns it home. The bunker.
GID00079076	The process is automated, and the casino itself has other, similar "services." I was unable to find a workaround, except to send others in as tools.
GID00079077	No... while it will erode your health, it will only bring you to the point of death, no farther. At that point...
GID00079078	The air here is lethal only if you enter concentrated pockets of the Cloud. Too long inside one, you'll die, so be careful where you step.
GID00079079	I've seen some survive concentration of the Cloud for short periods of time if healthy enough - others were too weak.
GID00079080	Rebreathers, chemical suits... there is no protection against it, it decays all it touches. I've found fighting it useless.
GID00079081	Yes, music was intended to be broadcast all over the Villa... over time, however, the radio signal has decayed and emits a different frequency.
GID00079082	Speakers and radios interfere with the bomb collar frequency, and can trigger the detonators... prematurely.
GID00079083	It is an unfortunate side effect, one I did not anticipate. I was unable to calibrate the collars to block the signals - so you'll have to make do.
GID00079084	Everyone asks that. Should be asking how they plan on leaving.
GID00079085	It only takes putting a collar on one to begin the chain. One with a collar may chain another. And that one, another. Had traps all over the wastes.
GID00079086	The chain ends with the super mutant. Although with him... the collar wasn't even necessary. He only needed... guidance.
GID00079087	Gather the three others needed for this job, return them here. After that, I'll have more instructions for you.
GID00079088	Take the others to their positions to trigger the Gala Event. After that, the doors of the Sierra Madre should open.
GID00079089	Yes. But not immediately. You'll hear a beep from your collar's detonator - when you do, step back, scan the area, and find the signal source.
GID00079090	There are damaged speakers, and shielded ones... the damaged ones you can destroy at range - don't get close, you can't switch them off like a radio.
GID00079091	The damaged speakers are sparking, ha... hard to miss. The casings are resistant to vandalism - punching or hitting them will not destroy them.
GID00079092	Travel West, toward the Villa Police Station - follow the radio frequency and the alarms.
GID00079093	Although there's a great deal of interference at the source. Perhaps that's why I lost contact with him.
GID00079094	No matter, aside from Collar 8, there should be weapons, armor at the police station. Go West, avoid the Villa inhabitants, bring the mutant back.
GID00079095	Gunshots, energy blasts - even spears thrown with great force - can puncture their exterior.
GID00079096	Shielded speakers can't be destroyed at all. You'll need to avoid them or switch them off via a terminal. I... I'll leave the method up to you.
GID00079097	Your piece of RobCo trash will help you, I've ensured it. It can latch on to the signal of the collars...
GID00079098	...and tune into their frequencies. The bomb collars come with radios embedded in them. You can eavesdrop easily.
GID00079099	It was part of their design... to listen in. They can even screen out white noise from the environment to allow greater monitoring.
GID00079100	Yes... Collar 8, the FEV reject, the Super Mutant. He's docile, predictable, and provided he's not starving, should be easy to command.
GID00079101	I lost contact with him some time ago... probably after he dragged you here from the trap. Find him, he'll follow you, collar or no.
GID00079102	A long story. FEV... a virus with an even longer story... it gave birth to the docile one, turned him into a Super Mutant long ago.
GID00079103	Because in some respects, breaking in to the Sierra Madre is easier than breaking human instinct. Greed.
GID00079104	The Villa is filled with corpses. Some killed by the dangers here, some by me. Others... turned on each other.
GID00079105	Once they realized the Sierra Madre could be theirs, they cared nothing for their freedom... their survival... or each other.
GID00079106	The ones brought here live on only in what they've left behind, their marks - graffiti on the walls. And victims they've killed.
GID00079107	Some tried to help... left supplies and healing for others who came. Their reward? They were tracked down, killed by others with baser instincts.
GID00079108	Some of these murderers went as far as to leave traps behind them... turning markers for help into deathtraps for anyone following them.
GID00079109	It killed some of them when they forgot where the traps lay... or when they desperately needed the assistance they had cut others off from.
GID00079110	Too many. This place is dangerous... and its quarantine measures, its hazards... have claimed many. Failures upon failures.
GID00079111	Do you think I wanted to place collars on you to ensure compliance? No... if robots could have done this, I would've sent them.
GID00079112	The Sierra Madre is a complicated lock. Cracking it open requires human hands.
GID00079113	The Sierra Madre has many... defenses, means of screening guests for illicit or dangerous items. Your arrival here, weaponless, was not my intention.
GID00079114	The Casino, this Villa... it takes anything with even a trace of radioactivity, traces of unknown substances... and returns it home. The bunker.
GID00079115	The process is automated, and the casino itself has other, similar "services." I was unable to find a workaround, except to send others in as tools.
GID00079116	Still... I have not left you defenseless, and the Sierra Madre's security in some respects, can help you if you are resourceful enough.
GID00079117	This place is well-preserved. Few who came here ever returned. All of the treasures of the Old World lie scattered about, virtually untouched.
GID00079118	Search, hunt... craft what you can from what you find. The trash of the Pre-War era can keep you alive - food, knives, more. Use them.
GID00079119	Even the Villa's toxins... and the residue it leaves behind... can be shaped into tools and weapons. Gather it as well.
GID00079120	Also... there is one more thing in your possession, a rifle that will keep you alive, as surely as the collar will.
GID00079121	It is a Holorifle, a weapon I constructed when I arrived... I have since made superior models - and modifications.
GID00079122	For now, that tool will have to do until you find other weapons... and I suggest you do, the Holorifle's ammo is limited.
GID00079123	Still, it should serve well enough. I fashioned it from the Holograms of the Villa and used it against the Villa's... living inhabitants.
GID00079124	The collars. They're Pre-War tech, I suspect this great land had... compliance issues before the war.
GID00079125	It's one of a series of models. The one on your neck? Special, easier to make adjustments. Unreliable in other ways, notably radio interference.
GID00079126	A place far from here, called the Big Empty. Almost didn't make it out.
GID00079127	Were two others there... a woman. And a man, a courier. The woman was familiar... the other... I don't know what happened to him.
GID00079128	Big Empty's a treasure box, a scientific graveyard of Old World misery. Like the Sierra Madre... there's treasures there, sleeping. Some, awake.
GID00079129	The Holorifle, the Saturnite alloy... the hologram technology, hibernation chambers, Securitrons, the collars...
GID00079130	...even the suits attached to those things stalking the Villa... that's only the surface of what's there. Right now, the Sierra Madre is what I want.
GID00079131	What do I want. Weapons. Security. A citadel of my own.
GID00079132	The Madre's all these things. It's a fortress and a weapon. A chance... to... "begin again."
GID00079133	Once I unlock its archives, I can carve the Mojave into any shape I choose.
GID00079134	The Cloud is unique in my travels. Its proximity to the Sierra Madre isn't a coincidence.
GID00079135	Right now it protects this casino, preserves it. It can be used to preserve other Old World relics - and cleanse them, at the same time.
GID00079136	And as much as I've researched hologram technology, the Big Empty facility was clear - only the Sierra Madre got Holograms working... properly.
GID00079137	The Holograms here kill trespassers. That's what I want. Dump one of those emitters in the middle of any battle, there's no defense.
GID00079138	It's like holding light in your hands. Can't fight it... only watch it burn. Just one is a portable army. Arm it - anyone stands against you, dies.
GID00079139	No, there is one last thing I want from the Sierra Madre. Its bounty. The machines that fill its streets, its corridors.
GID00079140	They provide, provide almost anything. Perhaps in the Pre-War era, they were commonplace, things to dismiss.
GID00079141	Now, they are far more valuable. You know it. They helped keep you alive.
GID00079142	Veronica... she... survived HELIOS. She would. Resourceful.
GID00079143	As for "losing" HELIOS One... that was the only outcome, aside from retreat. NCR, swarming like ants over Old World relics... Hoover Dam... HELIOS...
GID00079144	I won't let those... children seize anything else. Hardin... McNamara... can't stop them... won't. So I will, with the Old World as my weapons.
GID00079145	Sources of food, supplies... medical assistance, ammo... make more collars, even print currency. Make a nation.
GID00079146	The Cloud allows me to wipe the slate clean. Collars ensure cooperation. Holograms - defense. The Vending Machines provide... everything else.
GID00079147	The Sierra Madre can kill nations and build them, using its technology with the right applications.
GID00079148	Attack? No, not attack them. Wipe the slate clean. Make the Mojave like it was meant to be... undisturbed by man.
GID00079149	I'll send the Cloud, the Holograms. Bring ruin in my hands until only I stand atop the HELIOS One tower again.
GID00079150	I'll scour Hoover Dam with the Cloud, rain its walls with spears from the sun... with an army of Old World ghosts behind me, Holograms all.
GID00079151	I'll kill them until it's only me, me alone... in a quiet world. In a world that's nothing like what happened at HELIOS One.
GID00079152	I've read your Pip-Boy. Seen what you've done...
GID00079153	If you wish to end them... I could use someone like you. Resourceful. Uncompromising. NCR has many soldiers... many citizens.
GID00079154	I know that. Their days were numbered since they occupied Hoover Dam.
GID00079155	Hnh. Perhaps... perhaps I was too quick to put a collar on a potential ally.
GID00079156	Very well. I'll come down... and show you what the Sierra Madre has in store.
GID00079157	It started with... a setback. Fires, blood, beneath the sun... a sun so close you could touch it.
GID00079158	Moments like that, however, failures... can provide the brightest clarity.
GID00079159	You think I'm a murderer. If I was, I'd have set off your collar long ago... the collar ensures compliance, encourages... cooperation.
GID00079160	Think about it. Would you truly have gotten into the casino without those collars? No, human nature is against us, always.
GID00079161	Did you know... did you know that I had to keep adjusting the collars, keep changing the rules to make this moment possible?
GID00079162	Every time, even with collars clutched at their necks... they would betray each other, kill each other, to get inside the Sierra Madre.
GID00079163	It... it was insanity. They could've had it all, it was so close. And... and they kept turning on each other, again and again.
GID00079164	Cracking the Sierra Madre was difficult... but cracking greed, that was more difficult. So the dead man's switches went in.
GID00079165	When your life is tied to another's, sacrifice and cooperation - they can be conditioned, learned, and you can focus on the matter at hand.
GID00079166	Greed can be beaten. Contained. Controlled. You know it better than anyone... or I hope you do. It doesn't matter.
GID00079167	No. I am not going to take the chance while I'm so close... not this close, no. Not again... I can wait... afford to be careful.
GID00079168	You... you're locked down there. This is the only entrance, and I have free rein of the Sierra Madre. I have time... more than you.
GID00079169	Besides, there might be more traps. I'll send more scouts in... yes, others. You're... resourceful, don't want to leave anything more to chance.
GID00079170	Everyone asks that. Should be asking how they plan on leaving.
GID00079171	It only takes putting a collar on one to begin the chain. One with a collar may chain another. And that one, another. Had traps all over the wastes.
GID00079172	The chain ends with the super mutant. Although with him... the collar wasn't even necessary. He only needed... guidance.
GID00079173	The mutant. Heh! He swallowed one of the collars... after that, he was mine. The collar wasn't even necessary.
GID00079174	All his kind, they exist to be given orders. They're soldiers - simple, stupid. I ask him to fetch, he did... even without the threat of death.
GID00079175	Even when I stopped speaking to him, he continued to leave the Villa, gather victims from the mantraps, out of habit.
GID00079176	He must have found you in one of them. If so, he's probably forgotten - he only remembers my voice.
GID00079177	He put the collar on you, dragged you here, because he doesn't know any better. It's in his nature, greedy and child-like.
GID00079178	"Dog?" Hnh. Appropriate. It's what I called him. You've met him. You know why he forgot - his brain was ruined by FEV, his memory, wreckage.
GID00079179	He may know the way back, somewhere, deep down. I doubt it. He tracks by smell and instinct. Still, he could be trained.
GID00079180	It lies in the bunker - or whatever mantrap caught you. It's the Sierra Madre, its security systems strip guests to their garments.
GID00079181	It has... prejudices against outside material, "contraband." Almost anything with a radiation signature.
GID00079182	The New Vegas casinos do the same thing, manually. Although preventing bloodshed, not radiation poisoning, is their main concern.
GID00079183	Of course. I walked all this way. If you're worried... I'll give you a map back - or show you the way out when this is all over.
GID00079184	The Villa did, as an extension of the casino, yes - and then sent it back to the owner's residence. Here, "begin again" is more than a slogan.
GID00079185	You think I wanted to send you here without weapons, healing? No, the Sierra Madre lays you bare, strips and stores all your worldly possessions...
GID00079186	...it's automated to move things as the builder saw fit, Sinclair - even the guests. It's what divided your team, me, assigned us to "our floors."
GID00079187	No contraband, nothing foreign in his paradise - even common Pre-War vending machines were banned from the Villa.
GID00079188	No... I don't think so. It'd most likely trigger other security measures... if you hurt the Vault at all.
GID00079189	The builder of the casino built it to last - the Sierra Madre withstood the war. I'm sure the Vault is protected as well.
GID00079190	Besides, you wouldn't have followed the signal if you didn't want this place's secrets for your own. You're curious... past the threats.
GID00079191	Then all you need to do is wait, be patient. Hnh... you may be down there for a while. Just as I was, trapped inside the casino.
GID00079192	Consider this punishment for following the Sierra Madre signal in the first place. So eager to rush ahead... now, enjoy your reward.
GID00079193	You've gotten far. Any farther, try to breach the vault, you'll become a corpse.
GID00079194	What's inside is mine. Anyone else touches it... tries to take it from me... they'll answer for it.
GID00079195	[SUCCEEDED] The collar? Even if you could trigger it... no, you'd die.
GID00079196	[FAILED] Really? No, I don't think so. I can afford to wait, and your threats... meaningless.
GID00079197	Kill yourself, and you decide this now. I can shut down your signal, prevent the collar from going off.
GID00079198	[SUCCEEDED] Huh... clever.
GID00079199	[FAILED] Really? No, I don't think so. I can afford to wait, and your threats... meaningless.
GID00079200	[SUCCEEDED] The elevator. Then you'd be trapped for certain, no probability of escape.
GID00079201	[FAILED] The vault would be as shielded against vandalism just as the casino itself was. No... any damage you could cause would be minimal.
GID00079202	[SUCCEEDED] You might destroy access to the data... not the data itself. Besides, there would be safeguards in place.
GID00079203	[FAILED] There's nothing you can do that I cannot undo... or recover. And I have the time now, thanks to you.
GID00079204	But, you recognize the value of what's down there. You would no sooner destroy what's inside the Sierra Madre than destroy yourself.
GID00079205	Persist in threatening me... or the Sierra Madre's secrets, you're of no use to me, I'll set off your collar now.
GID00079206	[SUCCEEDED] Huh... clever.
GID00079207	[FAILED] Quite certain. How you managed to come all this way amazes me - perhaps it was luck.
GID00079208	[SUCCEEDED] Huh... clever.
GID00079209	[FAILED] Indeed... and how would I reach you, let alone speak to you. Perhaps you're not as resourceful as I suspected.
GID00079210	Even... even if you damaged the mechanism... there's a chance of repairing it. It might take years... but it's possible.
GID00079211	[SUCCEEDED] I've lost much in the past by... falling to my instincts. This time... this time will be different.
GID00079212	[FAILED] Silence and patience will convince me. I'll come for you, in time. Irritate me, and I'll silence you forever.
GID00079213	[SUCCEEDED] That signal... that siren's call... lured me in, yes. And being trapped in the Sierra Madre, perhaps forever...
GID00079214	That has made me more - cautious. I have my freedom, access to the bottom of the casino, and you, under my control. Heh... I can wait.
GID00079215	[FAILED] If you want to appease me, then do so in silence. I'll come for you, in time. Irritate me, and I'll silence you forever.
GID00079216	True... the collars... have worked better than I'd hoped. With adjustments.
GID00079217	Still... I'm not eager to leap into another trap - the Sierra Madre's or yours. This experience has taught me human nature is... unreliable.
GID00079218	You say your freedom is important to you - so did the others that fill the Villa, before they turned on each other.
GID00079219	[SUCCEEDED] Hnh. The collars... yes. Technology solves so many ills.
GID00079220	[FAILED] Enough talking, save your energy. You'll be down there for a while.
GID00079221	[SUCCEEDED] I... I have earned it, fought for it. Paid for it in blood, mine, others - countless times.
GID00079222	[FAILED] Let you go? To crawl back to whatever caravan whore spawned you? No, she was perhaps more talented in deals than you.
GID00079223	If you seek to goad me... impatience and greed led you here, not me, it doesn't control me as it does you.
GID00079224	I won't fall prey to another trap - either the Sierra Madre, or yours. There is no trust between us, and there will be no trades, either.
GID00079225	[SUCCEEDED] This casino isn't some caravan safe. And the lock that secures the Sierra Madre vault doesn't hold all its secrets.
GID00079226	[FAILED] Take all the time you need. I suspect the Sierra Madre is more than proof against bobby pins and crowbars.
GID00079227	[SUCCEEDED] Hiding in the Sierra Madre... an interesting thought. I'd come to see it more as a prison.
GID00079228	Hide, flee... it doesn't matter. The Sierra Madre is patient. I can be as well. You won't get any farther inside, and you won't escape my sight.
GID00079229	[FAILED] As long as you're wearing that collar, you're not far from me. A press of a button, and I'll find you - I'll just listen for the explosion.
GID00079230	Find a way inside - you can try. The Sierra Madre is a patient thing, and it has outlasted many who've come to its doors.
GID00079231	The punishment often equals the reward for those without the foresight to see what's in store. I'll let you test the security, see how you stand up.
GID00079232	[SUCCEEDED] I've had enough... enough of others stealing from me.
GID00079233	[FAILED] Take all the time you need. I suspect the Sierra Madre is more than proof against bobby pins and crowbars.
GID00079234	[SUCCEEDED] I've had enough... enough of others stealing from me.
GID00079235	[FAILED] As long as you're wearing that collar, you're not far from me. A press of a button, and I'll find you - I'll just listen for the explosion.
GID00079236	Hmm... compliance. Good. The others... fought, argued. If they had only obeyed...
GID00079237	I see the collar has done its work, I can hear it in your voice. Stand and wait outside the Vault, where I can see you from the elevator.
GID00079238	After that... I wandered, alone. Saw the storms of the Divide, walked among the Ciphers of the West. Traveled to the Big Empty.
GID00079239	I heard the signal. The woman's voice, the Sierra Madre, promising a chance to begin again, reverse my fortunes. All... nonsense.
GID00079240	I tracked the signal. Came here, scouted the city... using other hands. Kept dying on me, killing each other. You - you got the farthest of all.
GID00079241	Are you listening? Good. From now on, when I talk, listen - and follow my instructions.
GID00079242	Play stupid, play clever, make the mistake of saying "no?" That collar on your neck'll go off and take your head with it.
GID00079243	Hurry up and deal with the FEV reject, he's of no use to us.
GID00079244	Must be a back entrance to the kitchen - check the main casino side corridors. Find it.
GID00079245	Now get out, before your collar blows!
GID00079246	That idiot's opened the gas valves! A single spark - or he sets off his collar, the casino's going to burn. Us along with him.
GID00079247	Shut off the gas valves, or that idiot'll kill us all.
GID00079248	Don't let him spot you! If he does, talk him down before he has a chance to ignite the gas.
GID00079249	This is the past you're walking through. Few have ever seen it. No one else ever will.
GID00079250	I worked hard to get here, it'll give me what I need before I leave. And it'll always welcome me back.
GID00079251	Now... look for a way to wake this ghost up, remind it it's got guests.
GID00079252	You woke it up... good. Emitter frequencies... lighting up everywhere...
GID00079253	Damn recordings... dead echoes in the frequencies...
GID00079254	Casino's security is shutting down... opening up its vendor and gambling programs in the back casino... Heh! Still might be something for sale.
GID00079255	Maybe something can help you now - security's shut down. After you're done looking around, head to the lobby, and we'll deal with your... friends.
GID00079256	You inside. Can you hear me? Power's fluctuating... emergency power. Oh! You are in.
GID00079257	Good... thought that might be the end of you. Unfortunately, your... "friends" also found their way here. Knocked unconscious... just like you.
GID00079258	Wondering what happened? You were hit by casino security. Detects anything foreign - radioactive, it subdues the "visitor," moves them if needed.
GID00079259	Hnh... getting interference from old recordings... the guests who were trapped here... eh, shut that noise off...
GID00079260	Looks like the casino moved your "friends" around once inside... might be useful. Or not. Wonder if they came to help or kill you. Still...
GID00079261	My signal should work through the speakers, now that you're inside. Heh, heh! Welcome to the Sierra Madre, in all its glory.
GID00079262	This is what the Old World stood for, even with bombs about to rain down on them. Now look at it.
GID00079263	Beautiful... now its guests are all dead. Better this way. Quiet. How the Mojave should be.
GID00079264	Now - with the casino sleeping, it's got places closed off - won't let you go yet. We'll get there, trust me, just need to wake it up.
GID00079265	Speakers and radios interfere with the bomb collar frequency, and can trigger the detonators... prematurely.
GID00079266	It is an unfortunate side effect, one I did not anticipate. I was unable to calibrate the collars to block the signals - so you'll have to make do.
GID00079267	Casino's woken up, paying attention to us. Good.
GID00079268	Wondering what happened to your team...? Looks like they got moved to other floors. Interesting, maybe that's why... hmmm, yes... yes.
GID00079269	Perhaps the casino recognized specific guests... or guests with a voice or look close enough for them to be... assigned to that floor. We'll see.
GID00079270	Had hoped with the power restored, the systems would fully awaken... especially the sound archives.
GID00079271	But no... your teammates' collars on each floor are interfering with the systems.
GID00079272	It's the white noise filters embedded in their construction... they're blocking the casino speakers, the music.
GID00079273	You'll need to recalibrate... or destroy... each collar. To do that, you need to get close, re-set the signal - or blow their heads off.
GID00079274	I'll leave the choice up to you - my preference? End them now. They're of no use.
GID00079275	After all, it's safe to kill them now, provided you make it quick.
GID00079276	You see, the collars don't work inside the Sierra Madre... well, between floors. Else, I'd set off the collars, be done with it.
GID00079277	So find them, deal with them, as long as you're fast and can get off the floor after killing them.
GID00079278	The floors... whatever they lined this place with, interferes with the collar frequency... so if you kill them, you should have some time to run.
GID00079279	Uh... just not sure how long, may not be consistent. More... less... whatever, it doesn't matter.
GID00079280	What we need is in the basement, we need to go to the top first and ride our fortunes down. After we deal with your team on the other floors.
GID00079281	Find the mute and deal with her. She's somewhere on this floor.
GID00079282	Floor's buzzing with emitter signatures. Watch out for Holograms.
GID00079283	Your collar's ticking. Get out of that floor!
GID00079284	The elevator to the casino vault is locked, find a way to open it.
GID00079285	The door to the vault is voice-activated. Which means we need the starlet's voice. Or recordings of it.
GID00079286	If that Ghoul's still alive... correct that. Or break him.
GID00079287	Door's sealed. Must be a key to the backstage. Hunt for it.
GID00079288	Get to the door before the collar explodes, move!
GID00079289	Now, deal with the Ghoul. This has gone on long enough.
GID00079290	Think you can escape? No, that hand on your throat is mine, always was.
GID00079291	You won't get out. I'll bring the whole Sierra Madre down on you, bury you here with all the others.
GID00079292	You think you've escaped?! You can't outrun me, you were always under my control! Do you hear me?! Do you hear me?!
GID00079293	You've heard of the Sierra Madre Casino.
GID00079294	We all have, the legend, the curses. Some foolishness about it lying in the middle of a City of Dead.
GID00079295	A city of ghosts. Buried beneath a blood-red cloud... a bright, shining monument luring treasure hunters to their doom.
GID00079296	An illusion that you can begin again, change your fortunes.
GID00079297	Finding it, though, that's not the hard part.
GID00079298	It's letting go.
GID00079299	You've heard of the Sierra Madre Casino.
GID00079300	We all have, the legend, the curses.
GID00079301	Some foolishness about it lying in the middle of a City of Dead.
GID00079302	A city of ghosts.
GID00079303	Beneath a blood-red cloud...
GID00079304	...a bright, shining monument, reaching out, luring treasure hunters to their doom. An illusion.
GID00079305	A promise that you can change your fortunes. Begin again.
GID00079306	Finding it, though, that's not the hard part.
GID00079307	It's letting go.
GID00079308	It's letting go.
GID00079309	It's letting go.
GID00079310	It's letting go.
GID00079311	It's letting go.
GID00079312	You've heard stories of the Sierra Madre Casino. We all have.
GID00079313	This story's different than the others. It's all in promise of beginnings. And the ending.
GID00079314	The survivors of the Sierra Madre thought about gathering at the Fountain and waiting for the Courier.
GID00079315	In the end, the collars' silence made them uneasy, and the fear of turning on each other made them hesitate, and leave the goodbyes - unspoken.
GID00079316	The radio message at the fountain was enough for them, and there was no need to add another farewell on top of all they had suffered.
GID00079317	In the years that followed, the legend of the Sierra Madre faded, and there were no... new visitors to the city.
GID00079318	Years later, when a mysterious blood red cloud began to roll across the Mojave, then West toward the Republic, no one knew where it had come from.
GID00079319	Only that it brought death in its wake. Attempts to find the source of the toxic cloud failed.
GID00079320	The Mojave was cut off. Through the Cloud, lights were seen from HELIOS One.
GID00079321	There were stories of ghosts immune to gunfire, who struck down anyone they saw with rays of light.
GID00079322	The last chapter of the Mojave came when a modified REPCONN rocket struck Hoover Dam, releasing a blood-red cloud, killing all stationed there.
GID00079323	All attempts to penetrate the Cloud and re-take the Dam failed, and both the NCR and Legion finally turned away from it, citing the place as cursed.
GID00079324	In the years that followed, communities across the West began to die as traces of the Cloud began to drift over lands held by the NCR.
GID00079325	Only two remained alive in the depths of the Cloud, at the Sierra Madre, waiting for their new world to begin again.
GID00079326	The Courier, lured by the promise of the Sierra Madre, could not escape. Once inside the vault, the casino did not let go.
GID00079327	When the Courier finally passed away, the casino created a new Hologram to walk with the other ghosts that filled its casino.
GID00079328	It was a pre-programmed homage intended for another. It assumed a new meaning in the likeness of the Courier.
GID00079329	A means of allowing even the dead to begin again.
GID00079330	[Christine taps her collar, makes a sweeping gesture at the area, then begins to pulse her fingers outward, faster and faster.]
GID00079331	[Christine nods at the Vending Machine, then makes a sweeping gesture with both arms and draws them to her chest.]
GID00079332	I'm not one for church, but there's a bell tower to the north that has a nice view of the Sierra Madre. Well, did, anyway.
GID00079333	You smell gas? I smell gas. Might be a valve nearby, we can use it to torch any locals that come near us.
GID00079334	Surprised these homes weren't robbed blind, folks leaving the key out like that. If only the Sierra Madre'd done the same.
GID00079335	Now, there's a view. Hello, beautiful.
GID00079336	Bones. Dog not like bones, don't taste good... unless meat on them.
GID00079337	Cage over there with things to pull, hard to pull, Dog can do it. Done it before? Not remember.
GID00079338	Place with hard to pull things is over there... "W" on your wrist thing? Weh-st. West.
GID00079339	This is the place you need to go when everyone is in place. Until then... nothing more than a diseased view of the Sierra Madre.
GID00079340	Can you hear me...? Damn transceivers... let me link the collars to the speaker in the tower... then... there.
GID00079341	[You hear banging from the speaker, as if someone is hammering on a wall with their fists.]
GID00079342	[You hear a tapping from the speaker... a series of sharp taps, then a slow, two taps.]
GID00079343	I'll pull the switches. And when I find you, I'll pull your head from your body.
GID00079344	Ready. The both of us. I'll keep Dog locked in his cage... you just open the Sierra Madre.
GID00079345	Dog is scared... wants out of cage. Cage you put me in. Will pull levers, be good, just let Dog out.
GID00079346	Dog is ready to be good, pull switches, see the lights.
GID00079347	What are you waiting for? Rubbing it in? Strike up the band already.
GID00079348	Careful when you do... you think the Villa's bad now, you haven't seen anything yet.
GID00079349	Come on, partner. So close now, stage is set, strike up the band.
GID00079350	Just get ready to run when you do... I sure will. Think the Villa's bad now... you haven't seen half the hell this town can raise.
GID00079351	[The hammering stops for a second... and there's one final bang from the speaker, as if someone is smashing their fist into a wall.]
GID00079352	[A single tap comes from the speaker, then silence.]
GID00079353	Finally. Now, the gates will open. And so will the skies.

GID00079355	[The Hologram flickers in acknowledgement.]
GID00079356	The world's most famous stars and entertainers were invited to its Grand Opening.
GID00079357	An invitation was a sign of... exclusiveness.
GID00079358	The opening was supposed to symbolize a road to a brighter future, not just for the world...
GID00079359	... but for all who came to its doors.
GID00079360	A chance for anyone to begin again.
GID00079361	Except - the Sierra Madre never opened.
GID00079362	The war froze it in time, like a big flashbulb going off. The Grand Opening - one big ending of humanity.
GID00079363	It's still out there, in the Wastes, preserved, just waiting for someone to crack it open. But getting to it. That's not the hard part.

GID00079367	I warned you to cooperate. Now I'll have to begin again.
GID00079368	When you die, I'll be waiting...
GID00079369	Heh... now, come on, you open up. Open up, damn you.
GID00079370	Open the vault... I can make it worth your while, think about what you're throwing away. I have other weapons, other technology I can share with you.
GID00079371	And the Big Empty... I know the way there. I know some of its secrets... if...
GID00079372	The collars... the collars were a mistake, I see that now. Why would I kill you? After all you've done... after all we've done together.
GID00079373	Are you listening to me?!
GID00079374	Everything down here... I swear... so much you could use, you could rule the wastes with what's down here...
GID00079375	...make your own army, re-shape the world, and if others disagree... put collars on them, I can show you how.
GID00079376	Don't you leave me here. You can't do this to me.
GID00079377	Eh? Getting dark in here. Machine... machine's losing power, no. I still have Pip-Boy light... maybe... maybe... no, no, that doesn't work.
GID00079378	Where... where is the door. Can't find the door.
GID00079379	Calm, been in worse situations... find a way out... somehow, then find that Courier...
GID00079380	Maybe Veronica... no... no, she thinks I'm dead.
GID00079381	Must be someone... maybe that other courier, one with the flag on his back... maybe... no... no, said he'd never come to the Sierra Madre...
GID00079382	No way out. Can't... can't end like this.
GID00079383	You. I know you can hear me. When you die, Courier... I'll be waiting. Your grave's going look just like this vault.
GID00079384	When you die... I'll be waiting here... at the Sierra Madre. Waiting.
GID00079385	...would you stop? Such a kidder.
GID00079386	This is Vera Keyes, auditioning for Love Sets Sail... god, this script. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy to have the w...
GID00079387	...is that a plane over head? Those bombers are nothing but big hornets buzzing around the sky these days...
GID00079388	...is it gone. All right. This is Vera Keyes, auditioning for "Love Sets Sail."
GID00079389	"Malcolm... ever since our freighter went down, I feel like my heart's fallen to the bottom of the ocean along with my... ugh"
GID00079390	...along with my career. God... heh... all right, all right...
GID00079391	Sinclair?! Sinclair, I'm trapped. Please, oh god, the security systems won't let me out, they're keeping me here.
GID00079392	Sinclair! Sinclair!
GID00079393	We all pay for what we've done. I'm so sorry, Sinclair. Sorry, I... I should have trusted you.
GID00079394	I'm going to die here, amongst the ghosts. I... I'm still being recorded by the holographic system.
GID00079395	The doors, they... they sealed. I... I can hear the other guests, screaming to be let out, to let go.
GID00079396	Let go? Let go of what?
GID00079397	I came so far to be here... now, now I just want to leave. Please... let me leave.
GID00079398	Sinclair? Sinclair, where did you go? Why did you leave me here? Why...
GID00079399	Sinclair, is that you?
GID00079400	Think you can run? The longer you try and keep your distance, this scanning frequency will flush you out.
GID00079401	[Christine flicks her finger back and forth quickly like a switch, then nods to the north.]
GID00079402	[Christine frowns, looks upward, then back at you. She nods her head upwards, then makes the motion of holding a gun at the ready.]
GID00079403	[Christine's eyes dart around at the walls and the ceiling. She glances at the exit, then takes a slow breath. Sweat appears on her brow.]
GID00079404	[Christine's eyes dart in the direction of the screeching sound. She looks frightened and trembles slightly, as if fighting an urge to run.]
GID00079405	If your marker's right, think the roost we're looking for is to the southeast.
GID00079406	I am all about keeping low in this section of town... so let's see about creeping by the locals, all right?
GID00079407	Ah, aren't the trees lovely this time of year, all blooming and green...
GID00079408	Nice spot for sunning. Well, if the sun ever touched here.
GID00079409	Tired of being inside. Want outside, get food inside Dog.
GID00079410	Why leave a bear trap here, so high up. Someone's arm must have lost it.
GID00079411	Oh god. He... I guess he was lost a long time ago. Even at the end...
GID00079412	Still... thanks for bringing word. At least, now I know.
GID00079413	Hmm. Unlikely. He was a little too focused on gears and diodes... tech was the cure-all.
GID00079414	Would you mind if I looked at the message?
GID00079415	Fine. I guess it doesn't matter anyway, keep it. I won't ask again.
GID00079416	What was on it? What did he say?
GID00079417	Yeah. Yeah. Thought as much. He'd been fading away for a long time.
GID00079418	You did? Where? Oh my God, I mean... I thought... I don't even know what I thought might have happened to him.
GID00079419	But... you don't have a "this is good news" expression on your face.
GID00079420	...it doesn't matter. He died when we all retreated to Hidden Valley. I didn't expect to see him again, no one did.
GID00079421	You killed him? But...
GID00079422	Did he say anything when you met him? Anything...anything at all?
GID00079423	Where did you get this?
GID00079424	Guess I was right about the bad news, huh? Same look Elder McNamara always gave me when I was up for promotion.
GID00079425	All right, I'll watch it.
GID00079426	That was... that was hard to watch.
GID00079427	The parts I understood? Didn't matter. Past all the garbage, all it amounted to was goodbye.
GID00079428	Sorry... feel a little out of it. Head's spinning a bit...
GID00079429	Oh. Oh!
GID00079430	I think he left me a gift. Maybe I can use it better than he did.
GID00079431	Trapped him? Where?
GID00079432	This crouching's hell on my knees.
GID00079433	[Christine crouches down.]
GID00079434	Wish I had a Stealth Boy instead of this bear trap.
GID00079435	Right behind you.
GID00079436	Hnnnn. Dog is following.
GID00079437	No have wrist-collar now - Dog still good at not be seen.
GID00079438	How Dog hunted back West. For Lou.
GID00079439	Get a porter, carrying someone's bags - not my style.
GID00079440	[Christine puts her palm flat and lowers it to the ground, shakes her head.]
GID00079441	Allying with you is already more of a burden than I can bear.
GID00079442	Hnnh-Nnn. Dog can't carry any more.
GID00079443	I can help you in the Cloud, not for long, though.
GID00079444	Don't dive in for too long, only so much I can do to help.
GID00079445	[Christine looks at you, touches her throat, frowns.]
GID00079446	Hnnhrr... air smells bad.
GID00079447	Eyes stinging.
GID00079448	Won't get rid of me that easily.
GID00079449	Trying to lose me in the Cloud? Not a chance.
GID00079450	Let's bring down the house!
GID00079451	[Christine's face peels back in a snarl.]
GID00079452	Rhhhharrrhhh!
GID00079453	That's done it.
GID00079454	Ah! Get a rug, put me out, something!
GID00079455	[Christine begins to beat at the flames on her body.]
GID00079456	Hrnnnnooooo!
GID00079457	Fire.
GID00079458	Feeling the music.
GID00079459	Spring's back in my step.
GID00079460	[Christine blinks, takes a breath, then nods.]
GID00079461	Pain's going away.
GID00079462	Finally - pain's gone, can focus.
GID00079463	Nnnf!
GID00079464	Hnnhr!
GID00079465	Hnnhr!
GID00079466	Unff!
GID00079467	[Christine's eyes blank, and she falls.]
GID00079468	Hnnh.
GID00079469	Rrr!
GID00079470	Can finally park in handicapped spaces now.
GID00079471	[Christine taps herself, then waves her hand - she looks in pain.]
GID00079472	Hhrrnnnnnhhh!
GID00079473	Dog's damaged.
GID00079474	Yeah... that's the sweet stuff.
GID00079475	[Christine checks herself, gives the thumbs up.]
GID00079476	Hnh. Better.
GID00079477	Physician, heal thyself.
GID00079478	Bullets all cashed out here!
GID00079479	[Christine taps her gun in frustration.]
GID00079480	Hnnnrh?
GID00079481	Too many targets, not enough bullets.
GID00079482	Song and dance might work better than what I've got.
GID00079483	[Christine taps her weapon angrily, assumes defensive stance.]
GID00079484	Hrhhhnnnhh!
GID00079485	Can't hurt this one, give me something that will.
GID00079486	They're cutting through this like paper!
GID00079487	[Christine quickly taps what she's wearing, makes a hatchet motion.]
GID00079488	Don't want to repeat that number.
GID00079489	Feels like someone played my head like a trombone.
GID00079490	[Christine shakes her head, gets quickly back on her feet.]
GID00079491	[Christine quickly leaps to her feet, narrows her eyes, and scans the area.]
GID00079492	Nnnnnn... eyes went black.
GID00079493	Good thing Dog wake up and not other voice.
GID00079494	At least I woke up instead of remaining in the dark.
GID00079495	Whatever it is, I want to kill it.
GID00079496	Uh... could use a little boost here.
GID00079497	Great, spilling my guts out to everybody.
GID00079498	[Christine winces, then tries to hide it.]
GID00079499	Hrrrrrrn.
GID00079500	Losing blood.
GID00079501	I'm bleeding green here, any ideas?
GID00079502	[Christine winces, clutches her side.]
GID00079503	Hnnnhrrrrrhn.
GID00079504	Head swimming. Can't hold myself... together much longer.
GID00079505	I don't know. Last time anyone saw him was in the battle at HELIOS One. I wasn't there.
GID00079506	He gave orders to hold the plant until it could be reactivated. But he ran out of time. The NCR overran it. Everyone thought he was dead.
GID00079507	But I got a note from him at a comm station. That's... how he liked to talk, even to me. He wasn't good at face-to-face.
GID00079508	I would say he was my tutor, but that doesn't cover it.
GID00079509	After my parents passed, he looked after me. The whole Brotherhood brought me up, really, but he made sure of it.
GID00079510	I never had a grandfather - not that I knew, anyway - but Elijah was in some ways what I'd imagine a grandfather to be.
GID00079511	I hear you.
GID00079512	[Christine nods.]
GID00079513	Very well.
GID00079514	Hhh-hhnn. Dog hears you.
GID00079515	Yeah, right. Oh, you're serious. You bet.
GID00079516	[Christine narrows her eyes, nods.]
GID00079517	Of course... murder's in our blood.
GID00079518	Hrrrrrrrrrrr... Dog will do that.
GID00079519	All you, trust me.
GID00079520	[Christine raises an eyebrow, then shrugs.]
GID00079521	As long as you don't get yourself killed.
GID00079522	Only if save pieces for Dog...
GID00079523	That's a relief. I-I mean, not like I care. I'm fine on my own.
GID00079524	[Christine narrows her eyes, then shrugs.]
GID00079525	Make up your mind.
GID00079526	Dog stays.
GID00079527	I can't say it hasn't been fun... well, I can, but I'll save it for my memoirs.
GID00079528	[Christine nods.]
GID00079529	I'll make more progress on my own - just don't get us killed.
GID00079530	Dog will leave.
GID00079531	Arrrooooooooooohnhrhnhr.
GID00079532	So hungry.
GID00079533	Time to feed.
GID00079534	So be it.
GID00079535	Don't have time for this.
GID00079536	Just wanted a little peace and quiet.
GID00079537	Time to make some music.
GID00079538	Strike up the band.
GID00079539	Great.
GID00079540	[Christine's eyes narrow, stance changes.]
GID00079541	Lose the second-stringer, and I'll make the time.
GID00079542	Strike up the band, Domino's back in town.
GID00079543	[Christine glances at your companion, shakes her head, then raises her index finger.]
GID00079544	[Christine nods.]
GID00079545	I'll only travel with you... get rid of the other piece of meat, then we'll talk.
GID00079546	I'll follow you. For now.
GID00079547	Nnnn-Nnn... too many, Dog waits until you lose one... maybe let Dog feed?
GID00079548	Dog is ready. Where we go?
GID00079549	Tactics? What, we going to get into a shootout soon, or...?
GID00079550	[Christine raises an eyebrow suspiciously.]
GID00079551	Tactics? Why don't you let me worry about that - you just follow along, I'll take care of you.
GID00079552	Hnnrrh? What do you want Dog to do?
GID00079553	Style's not something you just change, friend.
GID00079554	[Christine looks at you and waits.]
GID00079555	As long as I am in control, fighting... is difficult. I'm not the... beast he is.
GID00079556	Hrnnnh? What do you want?
GID00079557	Sure, let's jaw all day and all night, why not?
GID00079558	[Christine frowns, taps the back of her wrist, then circles her finger.]
GID00079559	And what do you want to discuss now?
GID00079560	Hnnnh... Dog is listening.
GID00079561	If that's all, let's shake a leg.
GID00079562	[Christine nods.]
GID00079563	Good... you were starting to bore me.
GID00079564	Dog hears you, will follow.
GID00079565	Boxing's not really my thing. I prefer the gentle touch... but all right, it's your show.
GID00079566	[Christine nods, and her stance changes slightly.]
GID00079567	To warn you, as long as I'm in control, my coordination... suffers.
GID00079568	Dog good at smashing things that move with bear trap.
GID00079569	I'll be sure to cover you, don't you worry.
GID00079570	[Christine nods, closes one eye and slowly pulls an invisible trigger.]
GID00079571	While I'm in control, my ability to use his hands is... difficult.
GID00079572	Dog will try... trigger and sight... Dog prefer to hit with bear trap.
GID00079573	You're the one who dragged me out of my apartment, so yeah, I'm keeping close. So what?
GID00079574	[Christine tilts her head slightly.]
GID00079575	What is it? It won't matter in the end.
GID00079576	Hnnh?
GID00079577	Like dancing with your shadow.
GID00079578	[Christine nods.]
GID00079579	If you're sure.
GID00079580	Hrnnnh, Dog will be kin. Like others in night.
GID00079581	All right.
GID00079582	[Christine nods.]
GID00079583	Go on - but keep it quick.
GID00079584	Hnnh-hnnn.
GID00079585	Enough gum-flapping, Madre's not getting any younger.
GID00079586	[Christine nods.]
GID00079587	If you mean into the casino, then - yes.
GID00079588	Hnhhr!
GID00079589	Oh, you bet. I'll flank them... might take me a while, though, so you just hold tight.
GID00079590	[Christine nods, makes a half circle with her hand.]
GID00079591	I'll watch over you.
GID00079592	Hnn.
GID00079593	Fine. "Tactics" means "stay out of sight" around here anyway.
GID00079594	[Christine nods, waits.]
GID00079595	Fine. What else?
GID00079596	Hnnh-nnn. Dog not sure he remember anyway.
GID00079597	Wait a moment, before you go.
GID00079598	Everyone, please, may I have your attention.
GID00079599	Has your life taken a turn? Do troubles beset you? Has fortune left you behind?

GID00079626	Guess they skedaddled. Sounds good to me.

GID00079628	Nothing.
GID00079629	Where are they? Not done yet.
GID00079630	Lost them.
GID00079631	Where did you go?
GID00079632	No matter where you run, I'll find you.
GID00079633	Lost, but not forgotten.
GID00079634	Now where did you go?

GID00079638	Finished here.
GID00079639	That felt... good.
GID00079640	Nice finish.
GID00079641	Leave 'em wanting more.
GID00079642	[Christine scans the area, then relaxes slightly.]
GID00079643	Enough - the Sierra Madre is our target, not its ghosts.
GID00079644	Perhaps they ran. If not... we'll see them soon.
GID00079645	Hnh.
GID00079646	Sierra Madre's playing tricks with me now.
GID00079647	Forget this, let's focus on getting into the casino.

GID00079649	Food!
GID00079650	Dog was getting hungry.
GID00079651	Kill this one before they call others.
GID00079652	I'll end you.
GID00079653	Of course, it was getting too quiet.
GID00079654	Going to need a hand here, "partner."
GID00079655	[Christine's eyes narrow, stance changes.]

GID00079664	Something's moving, moving.
GID00079665	Trespassers.
GID00079666	Something's out there.
GID00079667	Sounds like we got a tourist.
GID00079668	What was that?
GID00079669	[Christine holds up her hand, pauses, then starts scanning the area.]
GID00079670	Where is the food?
GID00079671	Dog hungry, please come out.
GID00079672	Where are you?
GID00079673	I'll find you, you can't hide.
GID00079674	Still looking... although I'm all for following suit and leaving.
GID00079675	Vanished like a Maxis act.
GID00079676	[Christine scans the area intently.]
GID00079677	Hnnnrrrrrrrrrrrr.
GID00079678	Hnnnnrrrrrr...
GID00079679	Whatever it is, it's still out there. Waiting.
GID00079680	It'll come to us, Dog. Just wait. We'll kill it together.
GID00079681	Still out there.
GID00079682	I can hear you moving, whoever you are.
GID00079683	[Christine raises her hand, and starts scanning the area.]
GID00079684	What're you doing that for? Fine, let's settle this.
GID00079685	[Christine points at your collar, then hers.]
GID00079686	Hnnhh? Hrnnnnn.
GID00079687	If this is how you want to die, then so be it.
GID00079688	Fine, fine - don't want us both blowing up anyway.
GID00079689	[Christine checks herself, stops attacking, looks angry, points at collar.]
GID00079690	Hnnnr? Hnnn.
GID00079691	Next time, I'll break your legs and hang you from the Madre gates.
GID00079692	If you find a place to pawn that, go right ahead.
GID00079693	Greed took the others - go on, keep it. I'll get it back eventually.

GID00079696	Take from me again, and I'll leave you for the Sierra Madre.
GID00079697	Vera, sweetheart... see you soon.
GID00079698	Guess a fat lady's singing somewhere.
GID00079699	You win, Sinclair.
GID00079700	So much for the Sierra Madre.
GID00079701	[Christine clutches her collar as she falls, clawing at it.]
GID00079702	:: Death cry ::
GID00079703	Finally, the howling will end.
GID00079704	Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
GID00079705	[Christine makes frantic motions with her hands.]
GID00079706	Hhh-hhh-hhhhnnn!
GID00079707	Look out.
GID00079708	Let me whip up a special cocktail...
GID00079709	[Christine waves for you to get back, makes throwing motion.]
GID00079710	Hnnnh-Hnnnh-Hnnnh.
GID00079711	Let sound and thunder answer this.
GID00079712	Valor, you're up - discretion and me, we're outta here.
GID00079713	[Christine shakes her head, waves at you to follow.]
GID00079714	Hnnnh-hnnnh-hnnh.
GID00079715	Find a defensible position, we'll kill them there.
GID00079716	Ah!
GID00079717	[Christine takes the blow, doesn't flinch.]
GID00079718	Hnh!
GID00079719	Ennh!
GID00079720	Hnnnhhhr!
GID00079721	Die.
GID00079722	Time to cash this one out.
GID00079723	Godammit.
GID00079724	Batting a thousand, that's us.
GID00079725	Used to open in Paris. Paris. Now this.
GID00079726	Can't believe I left the apartment for this.
GID00079727	[Christine narrows her eyes, and her stance changes.]
GID00079728	Hrrhrhhhhnnnh!
GID00079729	Something needs to die.
GID00079730	Let's deal.
GID00079731	[Christine nods, adjusts her gear.]
GID00079732	All of your weapons will do. And your stims.
GID00079733	Dog fetches... will share... have food?
GID00079734	You sure? I mean... look, you can't just tell me to walk now, you know. That's... well, not very friendly.
GID00079735	[Christine raises an eyebrow.]
GID00079736	You... want us to split up. All... three of us?
GID00079737	Why you send Dog away? Dog hear you right?
GID00079738	[Christine nods.]
GID00079739	I'd shed a tear, but I'm sure we'll be chatting again.
GID00079740	I'd shed a tear, but I'm sure we'll be chatting again.
GID00079741	Come back if you need something.
GID00079743	Don't be ridiculous - point that somewhere else, will you?
GID00079744	[Christine frowns, points at your collar, then hers.]
GID00079745	I didn't take you for suicidal.
GID00079746	Don't shoot. Bullets hurt.
GID00079747	A little party favor before the grand finale.
GID00079748	[Christine points at mine, then taps her temple.]
GID00079749	Thinking ahead... good.
GID00079750	Want Dog to fetch bomb-thing? Or not touch?
GID00079751	Watch where you're chucking those things!
GID00079752	[Christine covers her ears.]
GID00079753	Don't waste those - save one for when they get close.
GID00079754	Arooooooooo!
GID00079755	The cleaners will knock twice. Make sure they're thorough.
GID00079756	Dog will obey. Dog will stay here... for now.
GID00079757	Things here... are... under control. Find the one that dragged us here, end him.
GID00079758	Thank you... for whatever you have done. I will remain here, need to get my strength back.
GID00079759	...Hnnnhrhhh... my voice... won't work, won't hold him, down, doesn't matter, won't help...
GID00079760	...Hnnnhrhhh... he's gotten too strong, too scared... even my own voice won't help...
GID00079761	You...? Master... no, not Master. Dog remembers you. Left Dog in cage, mean to Dog... now, Dog...
GID00079762	You... you hurt Dog, keep hurting him. Dog hungry, not want to hurt any more... not want to...
GID00079763	You...? Master... no, not Master. Dog remembers you. Kind to Dog... Dog can't...
GID00079764	Kind to Dog... then hurt Dog... you hate Dog, hate...
GID00079765	Master? Dog not hear you come in... too hungry, now... at cage door? Master, Dog is listening now you are close and he can hear you over hunger.
GID00079766	I'll wait here until there's fires in the sky.
GID00079767	Dog is waiting.
GID00079768	You better have brought enough meat. I can feel Dog's teeth tearing at my ribs, hungry to get out.
GID00079769	Why Dog eyes go black for bit. You talk to other voice?
GID00079770	Dog wants out... Dog is hungry.
GID00079771	Let Dog out. Hungry, hate being in here.
GID00079772	So here we are. A row of switches all lined up. How familiar...
GID00079773	...these switches won't move themselves, after all... there must be some trick to it. Now that I'm here... what do you expect me to do?
GID00079774	Why are we here? Dog not want to be here... place too much like a cage for Dog.
GID00079775	If Dog was fed like last time, Dog would listen. If the feeding was quiet.
GID00079776	So... are we on our way to somewhere else...? A Gala Event, perhaps?
GID00079777	Where are you taking Dog? Dog doesn't want to leave, heard Master... saw Master in sky.
GID00079778	And when Master not there... woman at fountain... she is made of lines and light, want to watch.
GID00079779	If it isn't the clever one. What do you want?
GID00079780	You are the nice voice... kind to Dog. You keep the other Voice quiet.
GID00079781	Remember you... you were mean to Dog, make Dog sleep... and other Voice come out.
GID00079782	Hnh. Dog remember you.
GID00079784	Be patient, I'm going. Maybe you should know when to let go.
GID00079785	You made it, good. I'm getting tired of waiting for you - and Elijah. Surprised? Yeah... I made it here, just like you did.
GID00079786	You made it, good... <Coughs>ugh.. Hurts to talk. I'll keep this quick in case my... voice goes out.
GID00079787	You're back. You sure you still want me here, collars and all? Not much for waiting around with a bomb around my neck.
GID00079788	I... I wish you luck in the Vault. Elijah... he's tough to pin down.
GID00079789	[Christine is looking at the Fountain, her eyes narrowed. She then scans the courtyard perimeter, gauging the distance.]
GID00079790	[She glances at your wrist, then back at the Fountain.]
GID00079791	[The woman before you looks disoriented, pained - she blinks a few times, then winces, as if the act of blinking causes her pain.]
GID00079792	[Christine points at the sky, makes a fist, then makes an explosion gesture with her fingers.]
GID00079793	[Christine shakes her head, narrows her eyes, then points at your compass.]
GID00079794	[Christine motions to you, points at the door uneasily, then makes a pulling motion with her hand. She seems hesitant to go near it.]
GID00079795	[Christine looks at you warily.]
GID00079796	[Christine glares at you.]
GID00079797	[Christine raises an eyebrow.]
GID00079801	So you showed. Felt the collar start kicking again as soon as the elevator doors rattled open.
GID00079802	Think you're going to up-stage me, here at the Sierra Madre? I don't think so. Now that I'm inside... well, I don't need you anymore.
GID00079803	Finally, a friendly face... hey! Partner! Up here.
GID00079804	In a bit of a predicament here... had to duck backstage, take a powder, the audience is a little... murderous tonight.
GID00079805	All right, you're resourceful, I'll give you that - it's going to take a lot more than juggling keys and shooting speakers to stop me.
GID00079806	As I see it? All I need to do is kill you, then make a run for the exit. You do the same, you'll be clawing at the lock until your head blows off.
GID00079807	So maybe you and I should have a little chat - just like we did when you first waltzed into town.
GID00079808	Those electric ghosts aren't the kind of audience I like at the best of times - at least the ones in the Villa had manners.
GID00079809	Don't even know how I ended up here... guess the casino still recognizes guests even after all this time, huh? How's that for history.
GID00079810	Not going to be performing here again, that's for sure. This place is a dump! Lousy acoustics.
GID00079811	Not now, we got bigger problems.
GID00079812	Was that him floating above the Fountain, the boss man? The one who put these bowties on our necks?
GID00079813	Sure does like to make a presentation... wish he'd keep it down, or else the Ghost People are going to swarm the gates, Vera Hologram or no.
GID00079814	Have a seat, and then we'll talk.
GID00079815	The Sierra Madre. Mmm... beauty, isn't she. She the one who invited you here?
GID00079816	Or maybe you didn't catch her voice on the radio. Woke up, confused, like some of the others. Least you're still breathing.
GID00079817	By the way, don't get up or make any sudden motions, no matter how uncomfortable that chair gets... the cushion's just for show.
GID00079818	I'll hold up my end, don't you worry. We get to the Sierra Madre, it'll be a different tune, trust me.
GID00079819	"Hold the wires, Dean." Talk about being a second stringer.
GID00079820	So this is where I'm supposed to put on the show? Played better venues, let me tell you.
GID00079821	What's that there... wiring? Looks... looks like it's tied to the sound system in the Villa, except for that snipped section there.
GID00079822	So... what, I stand here, hold the two ends in my hands, and tap them together like cymbals?
GID00079823	Didn't think much of our chances, now I'm thinking I was wrong. What's the next step?
GID00079824	Well, now, if it isn't my ball, chain, and dog collar rolled all into one.
GID00079825	You have that sad, questioning look in your eye. Not sure talking to me's going to make it any better.
GID00079826	[You get no response.]
GID00079827	Are you listening? Good. From now on, when I talk, listen - and follow my instructions.
GID00079828	Play stupid, play clever, make the mistake of saying "no?" That collar on your neck'll go off and take your head with it.
GID00079829	You've returned. Why? Gather the three as I've instructed, then I will have more for you - not before.
GID00079830	Good, well done... now, for the festivities, and your parts in all this.
GID00079831	The owner of the Sierra Madre... for whatever reason... keyed the Grand Opening to the Gala Event itself.
GID00079832	It needs to be fired off in order for the casino doors to open. As I've discovered, one person can't do it.
GID00079833	So, get your team into position indicated on your Pip-Boy, then trigger it properly.
GID00079834	You're so close now, don't let me down. Otherwise, I'll have to rely on the next team.
GID00079835	You. You're in the vault... finally. After all this time. The Sierra Madre... mine.
GID00079836	Don't move, don't go into the vault. And don't touch anything else... there may be more traps down there... another security system.
GID00079837	Enough talking.
GID00079838	Whoever designed the Sierra Madre... their obsession with messing with frequencies and signals...
GID00079839	I'm coming down - I'll meet you face to face at the vault entrance. If you resist, I'll use the collar, even if it puts the vault at risk.
GID00079840	I'm coming down - I'll meet you face to face at the vault entrance. No tricks. If you prove troublesome, well... there's always the collar.
GID00079841	I'm coming down, forget the Sierra Madre security, I'll find you myself. Try to break into the vault, I'll set off the collar.
GID00079842	Curious? You must be. We have time, now that you've done your work. And our interactions have been too one-sided, even for my tastes.
GID00079843	Ask! You still have time.
GID00079844	This is the place you need to go when everyone is in place. Until then... nothing more than a diseased view of the Sierra Madre.
GID00079845	Can you hear me...? Damn transceivers... let me link the collars to the speaker in the tower... then... there.
GID00079846	[The flickering Hologram stares at you expectantly.]
GID00079847	[The holographic cashier faces you, flickering. It seems to be waiting for you to speak.]
