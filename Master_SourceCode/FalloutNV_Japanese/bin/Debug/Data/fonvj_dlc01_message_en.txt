GID00079848	You found Dean's secret stash!
GID00079850	You decide it's best to leave Christine down in the manual override chamber.
GID00079852	You don't have a Holotape that will play in this projector.
GID00079854	You don't have the skill to do that.
GID00079856	Your collar has stopped beeping.

GID00079867	You have disabled the emitter.
GID00079869	Your collar is emitting a high-pitched beeping noise.
GID00079871	Explosive collar set to timer-based trigger.
GID00079873	The panel next to the elevator has buttons to go either up or down.

GID00079884	Dog has devoured a fallen enemy.
GID00079886	On quick glance, the diagram seems to have something to do with the switches immediately to the right of it.
GID00079887	(Intelligence 7)
GID00079889	Ignore the diagram.
GID00079890	Study the diagram.
GID00079891	Dead Money takes you to an extremely dangerous area of the Mojave Wasteland, a one-way journey until your business at the Sierra Madre is finished.
GID00079892	In Normal Mode, you'll encounter new traps, enemies, and new companions whose lives are tied to yours. In Hardcore Mode, you'll be fighting the environment as well, a toxic city that erodes health over time. Companions are more vulnerable, and so are you.
GID00079893	Dead Money is recommended for experienced Couriers (Level 20+). If up to the challenge, continue on. The Sierra Madre Grand Opening awaits... and has been for 200 years.
GID00079895	Stay in the Mojave Wasteland.
GID00079896	Seek out the radio signal in the Bunker.
GID00079897	The door won't open. It doesn't look like there's any power running to it.

GID00079905	The terminal doesn't respond. Something is preventing its standard functions.
GID00079907	The elevator appears to have been locked down by security. Perhaps Christine is involved.
GID00079909	Do nothing.
GID00079910	Dean has died.

GID00079919	She has learned a secret Melee Weapon technique that increases her attack speed by 150%% and gives her a 25%% chance to knock down enemies.
GID00079921	The elevator descends to a small, cramped room filled with electrical controls. There's no room to move, and the air is filled with a high whirring noise from the machines not unlike an Auto-Doc saw.
GID00079922	It appears the power can be manually controlled from this location - although it looks like manual operation was only intended for emergencies, and the terminal upstairs could do it via remote provided it was unlocked.
GID00079923	This knowledge in hand, you take the elevator back up to the Switching Station.
GID00079925	This door is hermetically sealed due to the gas leak and Elijah's override. It will not open until the valves are shut off and Dog is dealt with.

GID00079939	Return to the Mojave Wasteland.
GID00079940	You are no longer being poisoned by a toxic cloud.

GID00079975	Leave the generator alone.
GID00079976	Smash the generator.
GID00079977	This is an unusual-looking crafting station. As you approach, lines of tiny holographic items appear on the dispensing tray - wireframe schematics and lists of consumables the machine can assemble and package for the consumer. There is a slot on the side with a Sierra Madre symbol. The slot does not look part of the original design.
GID00079979	Dean has gone to the Villa Fountain.
