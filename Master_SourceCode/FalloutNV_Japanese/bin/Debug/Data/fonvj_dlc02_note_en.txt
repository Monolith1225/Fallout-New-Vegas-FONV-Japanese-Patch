GID00086060	September 20th
GID00086061	I count 28 of them. 11 adult males, 8 females, 9 children aged 2 - 10. Some rifles and pistols in bad repair. Old world clothes, ratty.
GID00086062	September 22nd
GID00086063	Got close enough last night to hear them talk. Spanish, I think. From Mexico?
GID00086064	Heard them say "paradeeso" a bunch. Think that means paradise. Here to stay, then.
GID00086065	Seem harmless. SEEM.
GID00086066	October 5th
GID00086067	The one I call "Maria" is pregnant. Think the father is "Jose" but she spends a lot of time with "Pablo" too.
GID00086068	October 7th
GID00086069	"Pedro" ran out to pee in the stream and would've seen me if he looked to his left. Too close. Need to give them space.
GID00086070	November 10th
GID00086071	"Jose" broke his leg chasing a bighorn. Too far from camp for them to hear. Told myself to leave it be but couldn't. 300 yards from their camp did my best Jose screaming imitation until a bunch of them came looking, then strung them along to the crest where they could hear the real Jose.
GID00086072	Probably useless. Compound fracture, broke the skin.
GID00086073	November 11th
GID00086074	"Infec-shee-own." So many goddamn words nearly the same, think I'd be fluent. But anyway Jose's leg has got it so he's going to die. Nature for you. Of course they're giving prayer a try.
GID00086075	November 12th
GID00086076	Left bottle of antibiotics on a rock outside their camp last night. They thanked God (Dee-os) of course. As though that asshole saw fit to burn the world but still cared enough to leave some medicine on a rock.
GID00086077	November 15th
GID00086078	Jose will always limp but otherwise he'll be okay. Good deed for the month.
GID00086079	Will they make it through the winter?
GID00086080	Hi Mandy,
GID00086081	This is Horace Applebaum out at the Zion General Store. I placed an order three weeks ago for the De-Luxe Mountain Man All-In-One Survival Kits - you know, the ones that come with a compass, a pair of walkie-talkies, and a full first aid kit?
GID00086082	I'm writing to you because, as of today (06/15/2057), I still haven't received the shipment. I'm fresh out of the kits here, and with the summer tourist season picking up I really need the new ones ASAP.
GID00086083	Thanks,
GID00086084	Horace
GID00086085	February 28th
GID00086086	Ambush in the narrows. 6 males killed. Took a 10mm through thigh, steel jacket, missed femoral. Lucky. Used tourniquet to make sure no blood spattered on rocks back to cave. Have set traps all along entrance passage but if they find me it will be matter of time. Still, 24 confirmed kills in 10 days = at least 1/3rd their combat force, not bad for an old man.
GID00086087	March 2nd
GID00086088	Lucky lucky lucky lucky. Patrol was small - 3 men. Screaming woke me - point man caught under deadfall. Panic fire ricocheted into the cave, almost hit me. Crawled forward and killed them all with SMGs. Nearly used frags, stupid, finger in pin when remembered ricochets.
GID00086089	Leaving at once. No other patrols in area but they'll be searching narrows for these 3. Taking as much food as I can drag with me and heading to cave south.
GID00086090	January 1st
GID00086091	Happy New Year.
GID00086092	Two months in cave. Still lethal outside. Don't get it. In army they said 2-4 weeks cleared fallout.
GID00086093	Less than a month's water left. Been mopping condensation off cave walls, wringing shirt into bottles. Trading calories for H2O. Food stocks holding. Thanks, USGS.
GID00086094	If there was even a chance I'd see the two of you again, I'd run outside.
GID00086095	January 10th
GID00086096	Sounded like windstorm out there for 2 days. Radiation down 500. What happened?
GID00086097	January 15th
GID00086098	Took a peek. Snow. It glows green.
GID00086099	January 28th
GID00086100	Radiation low enough I could risk short exposure outside.
GID00086101	More important, cave stream now drinkable if I use Rad drugs.
GID00086102	January 30th
GID00086103	There is nothing alive out there.
GID00086104	June 14th
GID00086105	Just got back. Tired. Good scrounging along the way. Ended up dragging back a cart of stuff.
GID00086106	Write tomorrow. Sleep.
GID00086107	June 15th
GID00086108	Departed April 10th. Walk to SLC took 15 days. Would've been 7-9 back in the old days, but had to circle pockets of radiation and foraged along way.
GID00086109	Don't know what I was thinking. Imagined I'd find my house, dig through rubble, find - something. Your bones I hoped, and Little Nut's. Would've buried them. Here in Zion maybe.
GID00086110	SLC is mostly craters. Warped steel girders where highrises sat. Mounds of bricks.
GID00086111	Never found our house. Didn't even find street. What wasn't a crater was scorched clean.
GID00086112	Want to believe it was fast, a flash, both of you vaporized. Lies to make me feel better. I'll never know. Which part of city got hit first? Northeast and you both died in a blink. Farther away and you burned alive screaming or the blast broken glass and bits of brick and wood splinters shredding you like hamburger. Look at it coward and listen don't turn away face it. If you'd been brave lucky man you would've found a spot and blown your brains out.
GID00086113	But not you. You took your time walking back, made a shopping trip of it. Scrounger.
GID00086114	The truck was still there on the 77 north of Spanish Fork. The Chryslus too, but no sign of the old couple's bones.
GID00086115	Outside Nephi I caught a trail. Three men, tracks heading toward Fountain Green. Thought about following but didn't. Stupid fantasy of friends, more likely cannibals.
GID00086116	June 20th
GID00086117	Took two days to build door and electrify it.
GID00086118	No soliciting, assholes. Home sweet fucking home.
GID00086119	April 25th
GID00086120	24 of them, half boys, half girls. Youngest is 8 maybe, oldest 13-14. Dirty and scrawny, been on foot a long time. Children's crusade.
GID00086121	Struck camp on nearly the same spot as los mexicanos. 30 years and a lifetime ago.
GID00086122	I've spent 2 nights listening to them. English. Literate. One of them reads stories while the little ones fall asleep.
GID00086123	They escaped someplace they call "The School" but can't figure out where it was. When they want a little one to behave they tell him to stop or "The Principal will get you."
GID00086124	Principal better not show up or I'll blow his goddamn head off. I can still shoot straight.
GID00086125	October 28th
GID00086126	Five days on foot, still can't sleep.
GID00086127	Outside it's like nothing happened. Sky looks wrong, that's all.
GID00086128	Hike back to overturned NatGuard truck near Toquerville? After blisters heal, maybe.
GID00086129	Looks like USGS team was researching something here in cave. Cleared out when bombs fell, left equipment behind. Probably thought they had families to run back to.
GID00086130	October 29th
GID00086131	Char, must've said this out loud a thousand times walking here. Maybe writing it will feel more like you heard.
GID00086132	You were right.
GID00086133	I was north of Spanish Fork. Took the 77 along Provo Bay to steer clear of town. Would've been home in an hour. Engine died, truck just stopped. So did a Chryslus in other lane. Knew right away.
GID00086134	First nuke hit SLC inside a minute. I was looking South - Lucky Man! Flash behind me so bright world looked on fire. Old couple from the Chryslus starts screaming they can't see.
GID00086135	Didn't watch you die, Char. Saved my eyes. Counted 12 more flashes next 7 minutes. Ground shook each time, 18 seconds later.
GID00086136	When nothing hit for half hour, took a look. Globe of fire where you and Alex died. Didn't kid myself.
GID00086137	Didn't know what to do. Grabbed my pack and rifle.
GID00086138	Saw to the old couple. Sat them up against car, let them hold and comfort each other. Told them I was going to get help, everything be okay. One bullet through both heads. Instant.
GID00086139	Five day hike back to Zion.
GID00086140	You told me. Stop running off to the wild. Man belongs with his family.
GID00086141	You were right. You were right. You were right. You were right. Wasn't there to hold you and my boy. Died without me. Never touch you or him again.
GID00086142	Should shoot myself. What I deserve.
GID00086143	Can't. Maybe soon.
GID00086144	October 31st
GID00086145	Black rain falling outside. Geiger jumping. Should let it kill me but bottling water from back of cave all the same.
GID00086146	November 2nd
GID00086147	Sounds dead outside, but can't look. Geiger goes lethal 15 feet from cave mouth.
GID00086148	Do the math. Radiation goes down before water runs out or I never leave this cave.
GID00086149	If you are reading this message then do yourself a favor and turn and run straight out of this canyon.
GID00086150	For near 11 months my people have been engaged in daily battle with an evil spirit of this place. Arriving February of last year with a party 118 strong, we were attacked by primitives and forced to defend ourselves. Whereupon something began killing us in wide numbers. We have done our absolute best to find and kill this thing, thinking it was a man because it uses our firearms against us and traps of all kinds. But no man could defy our efforts as this thing has. It is more evil than any man could be.
GID00086151	We have been reduced to just 34 of our number. We have lost six overseers before me. Some have perished from the sickness in their lungs we carried out of the Vault, but that number is small next to the count of friends this thing has murdered.
GID00086152	Now that I am finally made overseer, we are leaving straight away and will not return. If you have come to this seeming paradise seeking the fresh water, abundant game, and shelter you suppose you will find here, do not be deceived. You will find only death here. Leave at once and put miles between you and this place.
GID00086153	May God have mercy on us all,
GID00086154	J. Hendricks
GID00086155	Overseer
GID00086156	V22 Expedition
GID00086157	January 2nd
GID00086158	I've been leaving notes for them, and gifts.
GID00086159	They like the books. Started with stories but moved on to weapons manuals, medical books, practical stuff.
GID00086160	In the notes, well it's embarrassing, almost like those cards people used to give to each other, everything sweet and loving. I tell them to read and to learn and to make the most of their new home. I tell them that I'm giving them Zion as a gift to make up for all the sorrows of their lives so far and all the sorrows man has visited on man. I tell them to be kind to each other and modest. I tell them never to hurt each other but that if someone else comes along and tries to hurt them to strike back with righteous anger. Stuff like that. I sign every note "The Father," because well, just because.
GID00086161	January 18th
GID00086162	Have I mentioned that I'm dying?
GID00086163	Mind's still sharp. Lungs are the problem. Might be cancer. Cough's been getting worse for months, finally there's blood in it. Getting harder to visit my little friends, breath's so short.
GID00086164	I've given away most of what I own. They'll find the rest in the caves when they get a little older.
GID00086165	I don't want them to find me though. "The Father" is a broke-down old man? Disappointment.
GID00086166	It's time. I don't want another birthday.
GID00086167	January 23rd
GID00086168	It's cold enough that I won't last long on the high mound up next to Red Gate. I think I've got enough breath left in me to make it. I'll just lie down and stare at the sky. Feels right.
GID00086169	I hope they'll do well. I hope no harm comes to them, from within or without. Did my best to prepare them with the last few notes. Said something kind about each one of them, what makes each one special. Told them The Father was pleased by their kind natures and that it would be up to them to handle things on their own from now on, that I'd be silent but still watching and still caring.
GID00086170	Lying, then. Oh yes.
GID00086171	Lied to you, Char. And Alex. And Sylvie. Told you I'd be with you forever. But I wouldn't go back and unsay it once if I could.
GID00086172	What was the point of it all? So many failures.
GID00086173	But I never forgot your face. Or Little Nut's. Or (sorry) Sylvie's. They used to say that happened after a while but it never did for me.
GID00086174	Maybe the only point of all this living was to keep those pictures in my head going for as long as I could. It was the only life I could give you. Not a day went by without.
GID00086175	It wasn't choice. I chose to die again and again. Just never did. Body had its own drive.
GID00086176	Well, the little ones will need it. Species will need it if it's to continue. That blind drive onward.
GID00086177	I wish them well. It's been a gift to me, at the end of it all, to behold innocence.
GID00086178	Goodbye, Zion.
GID00086179	Randall Dean Clark
GID00086180	Feb 5th, 2053 - Jan 2124
GID00086181	March 5th
GID00086182	Baby was breech. Would've been a son. Michael.
GID00086183	Did my best to turn him. Failed. Must've done Caesarean too late. Had to put Sylvie out and she never woke up.
GID00086184	Buried them south of the narrows.
GID00086185	Well. This time I was by their side. So much better.
GID00086186	I think I can finally do it. Blow my fucking brains out all over this goddamn cave.
GID00086187	February 11th
GID00086188	Fuckers killed all the men. I think they would've taken the women alive but Maria and Selena opened fire and some of the others went for their guns so they shot them down and some of the kids with them.
GID00086189	If I could've warned them.
GID00086190	February 12th
GID00086191	Elena and Carmen and 5 children still alive, being kept in a pen.
GID00086192	There are more than 100 of these assholes in blue suits. Every suit says "22" on the back. Why? Armed to the teeth with submachine guns, pistols. Estimate 60% male. Everyone seems to follow the dark-haired guy but can't get close enough to tell. Assholes are disciplined - patrols, sentries - they mean business.
GID00086193	Say I go in at night and get the women and children out. Where to next?
GID00086194	But I have to get them out. Have to.
GID00086195	February 13th
GID00086196	Recon during night. Well-organized, sentries along most approaches, but stream not covered.
GID00086197	Are they sick? Lots of coughing fits. Tuberculosis?
GID00086198	Women and children still in pen. Will try to infiltrate by stream tomorrow night.
GID00086199	February 14th
GID00086200	They ate them.
GID00086201	February 19th
GID00086202	Ambush along riverside trail. 6 males killed. Heard their coughing a mile away.
GID00086203	Used their grenades to booby-trap bodies, kept half. Secured 6 SMGs, 500 rounds 10mm, 6 frags.
GID00086204	February 20th
GID00086205	Ambush along riverside trail. 2 males died checking bodies. Killed 2 more with rifle. Shot 1 through calf and let asshole crawl off to spread message. Coughed like I'd shot him through lungs.
GID00086206	February 23rd
GID00086207	Ambush half-mile east of coal pits wash. 8 males killed.
GID00086208	May 5th
GID00086209	The comeback goes on.
GID00086210	Add prickly pear to list of survivors with honey mesquite, and banana yucca. Odd nodules / mutations but safe to eat. Harvesting oh so careful, never take more than a fifth. Mouth waters every time I'm about to eat something that isn't from a can.
GID00086211	May 7th
GID00086212	Clouds of those stinging flies near fallen tree I call The Napper. Little flashes in the cloud. Something dragonfly-sized that zaps them midair then scoops them up. Something new.
GID00086213	May 19th
GID00086214	Bighorn sheep! A family - ram, ewe, and little one
GID00086215	Fucking Goddammit
GID00086216	May 20th
GID00086217	The sheep were different. Brawny. Ewe had curved horns just like the ram.
GID00086218	Seen some tiny lizards but this is first time seen animals that big.
GID00086219	Fingers crossed. 5-10 years breeding, fresh meat, hides, horns.
GID00086220	I know it's time to go back, Char. When winter has passed.
GID00086221	September 9th
GID00086222	Never been so scared in my life.
GID00086223	Canada wasn't scary, just sickening, the criminality of it.
GID00086224	The end of the world wasn't scary. When I knew you and Alex were dead, I didn't have anything left to be scared about. I just went on for some reason.
GID00086225	I wasn't scared fighting the Vaulters. It was like I kept daring them to finish me. When I killed them, I think it was the closest I came to feeling happy in years.
GID00086226	Sylvie is pregnant. And I am terrified.
GID00086227	Ridiculous old man. A father again at 47. In this world?
GID00086228	She's so excited and so - trusting. Says it's God's will that we have this child. Like nothing can go wrong.
GID00086229	You see, Char, she doesn't know about you and Alex. Never told her. Almost did sometimes but what you and I had, it seemed wrong to share it.
GID00086230	More like an old man not wanting his young wife to know how he failed the one who come before her.
GID00086231	Hiking into Toquerville for medical books and supplies. This will be done right.
GID00086232	I'm sorry, Char. Hope you can forgive me.
GID00086233	February 5th
GID00086234	Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me, happy birthday you useless old dinosaur, happy birthday to me.
GID00086235	Happy 60th. What do you get a man who has everything?
GID00086236	A bottle of whiskey and a 12 gauge slug through the roof of the mouth! Whoo!
GID00086237	Come now. What do I have to do to prove to myself that I've lived long enough?
GID00086238	I'm a shriveled old man. White beard. Seen enough sunrises and sunsets. Saw the big sunset, been hanging on through the long night 36 years now. Ridiculous.
GID00086239	Not kidding myself into thinking there's anything on the other side of this. Fine. Things weren't so bad before I was born.
GID00086240	Char and Alex. Sylvie and Michael-who-could've-been.
GID00086241	Thoughts of the beloved dead before dying.
GID00086242	Goodbye, Zion.
GID00086243	February 6th
GID00086244	Fucking didn't do it, coward as usual. Maybe two bottles next year.
GID00086245	January 13th
GID00086246	The Coughers are gone finally. All 34 that still lived. Ate their dead for strength, then struck out SE.
GID00086247	Victory. 10 months of killing. All I feel is cold.
GID00086248	They deserved every goddamn bit of it.
GID00086249	January 17th
GID00086250	Thought I was dreaming but the screams were real. For a moment thought they'd tricked me, just pretended to leave Zion, then sent a patrol to track me down. But the screams were a woman's.
GID00086251	Edged around corner in passageway to have a look. One Vaulter, ankle deep in bear trap. Leveled my SMG but the way she was crying stopped me.
GID00086252	How she screamed when she saw me. Been their boogey man a long time.
GID00086253	Name's Sylvie. Claims she ran away from them. Calls them evil people, "children of the devil." Turns out they were sick after all, something they caught in a Vault they lived in. She never came down with it (yet).
GID00086254	So help me, I've wound up being her nurse.
GID00086255	January 18th
GID00086256	Her story matches what I learned from my "interrogations" last year, but according to her - let's just say it was bad to be a woman in that group. So when they left, she slipped away.
GID00086257	She knows next to nothing about living outside a Vault. Says she wants to learn.
GID00086258	August 22nd
GID00086259	10 sets of tracks 1/2 mile NE of canyon entrance. Barefoot???
GID00086260	August 23rd
GID00086261	Saw them through scope. Corpses walking around. Finally gone crazy. Dementia maybe.
GID00086262	August 24th
GID00086263	I'm not crazy, they're real. Goddammit they are real.
GID00086264	Rushed me the moment they saw me, snarling like animals. They look like corpses but don't smell rotted.
GID00086265	I'll be putting them out of their misery. Doing for them what I never could for myself.
GID00086266	September 3rd
GID00086267	The last of them. All gone.
GID00086268	Mandy,
GID00086269	Who the hell is running this shipping company? I've just received three crates of Dinky the Dinosaur(TM) Officially-Licensed Dino-Action Dolls! These things were supposed to go to some tourist trap in Nevada, how the hell did they get here?
GID00086270	Mandy, what the hell can I do with this stuff? Maybe if we file off the Dinky trademarking we can turn them around as kiddie souvenirs and make a few bucks, but I'm still looking at a major loss here.
GID00086271	Whatever's going on in your shipping department, take care of it, or I'll find somebody else to handle my orders, I swear to God.
GID00086272	Yours,
GID00086273	Horace
GID00086274	PS - I still haven't received that order of survival gear I requested last month. You know, things I can actually sell to people?
GID00086275	Dear Scoutmaster Mitchum,
GID00086276	Thanks for following up! You'll be happy to know that the Li'l Scout Lunchboxes you ordered have arrived. You can pick them up from the General Store when you arrive in Zion. The General Store is open Monday through Saturday, 7 am till nightfall. We look forward to seeing you and your scouts on Independence Day!
GID00086277	All the best,
GID00086278	Horace Applebaum
GID00086279	Daniel has mentioned that the Sorrows could use additional healing powder to supplement their existing supplies. The ingredients to make healing powder, Xander Root and Broc Flower, can be found throughout Zion. In addition, caches of healing powder may also be present at camps in the valley.
