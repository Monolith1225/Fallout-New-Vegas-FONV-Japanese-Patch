GID00097278	What was that sound you played? Some kind of memory glitch?
GID00097279	It could be one of those robo-viruses. You might be contagious - stay away from other computers.
GID00097280	Probably just some old data floating around in your memory. Nothing to worry about.
GID00097281	That's an impressive multitool suite you've got. I bet I could make all sorts of stuff with that.
GID00097282	You look like a toolbox. Can you help me make stuff?
GID00097283	Hey, is that an ArmCo Portable Reloading Bench built into you? That'll be handy.
GID00097284	Do you do anything with bullets? Like, maybe help people make them?
GID00097285	ED-E? What are you doing here?
GID00097286	What's an Eyebot doing here?
GID00097287	Can you repair my weapon?
GID00097288	If you switched to the 3/8 wrench and the smaller drill, those weapon repairs would be easier.
GID00097289	Wow, you're way better at fixing weapons than me!
GID00097290	If you drop the power output by .24, you'll be able to make more energy ammo with no quality loss.
GID00097291	Wow, you're way better at fixing weapons than me!
GID00097292	I need some Microfusion Cells. Can you make some?
GID00097294	I'm running low on Small Energy Cells. Can you make me more?
GID00097295	You know, if you strip out the plasma relays on those energy cells, you could make flamer fuel.
GID00097296	Could you maybe make some energy cells that catch fire instead?
GID00097297	Remove the safety catches on those Microfusion Cells and you could turn them into satchel charges.
GID00097298	I want something that goes boom. Can you do that?
GID00097299	Can you make me some flamer fuel instead of energy cells?
GID00097300	I don't need energy cells right now - I'd like some satchel charges, ED-E.
GID00097301	I'd like to make some ammo. Can you help me?
GID00097302	Let me access your multitools. I want to make something.
GID00097303	I'd like you to replay one of those audio logs.
GID00097304	Look, we don't need to fight about this - we can talk this out, right?
GID00097305	You brought me here to talk. If you wanted to kill me, you'd have waited until I came for the Chip.
GID00097306	What are you doing here?
GID00097307	Can you tell me again what you're doing here?
GID00097308	Dry Wells is destroyed - that was your birthplace?
GID00097309	The Long 15 is no more. The main supply line into NCR is cut.
GID00097310	Caesar is dead, I killed him.
GID00097311	Caesar is dead, died on the operating table.
GID00097312	Was hoping you could help me shape something.
GID00097313	Is this where you're making camp?
GID00097314	Any recipes you can teach?
GID00097315	Any more recipes.. or histories... you can teach?
GID00097316	Any more recipes you can teach?
GID00097317	I got your final message.
GID00097318	I reached Vegas, and I dealt with House.
GID00097319	Wait here.
GID00097320	<Follow Protocol::Wait>
GID00097321	Find anything in the dust of Hopeville?
GID00097322	Have you been to Hopeville since the Ashton missile hit?
GID00097323	It sounds like you know me, but I've never met you.
GID00097324	We've never spoken before - I'd remember your voice.
GID00097325	Any recipes you can teach?
GID00097326	I have some materials I've gathered, if you wanted to take a look.
GID00097327	Let's get going.
GID00097328	<Follow Protocol::Reinitiate>
GID00097329	No, it wasn't your boot-up sequence, it was a recording. Something about someone called RALPHIE.
GID00097330	Yes, I'm sure I heard it. Did something knock your memory modules loose?
GID00097331	Okay, if you don't want to tell me, just say so.
GID00097332	I think I could use your help getting out of here. Can you come with me?
GID00097333	That's a recording from your development - are you saying you can override electronic security?
GID00097334	Was that the voice of your creator? What happened to him?
GID00097335	That's fascinating. Let's keep going.
GID00097336	Only panels with a dish-shaped receiver? The console in the main room had one of those, I think.
GID00097337	Well, it might be enough to get us through this silo.
GID00097338	Well, I'm sure he's fine. Wherever he is.
GID00097339	Maybe you'll see him again someday.
GID00097340	All right, let's keep moving.
GID00097341	It sounds like Dr. Whitley really cared about you.
GID00097342	Dr. Grant sounds like a war crime waiting to happen.
GID00097343	That's a terrible story, ED-E, but we should get moving.
GID00097344	Who the hell is "General Winters?" The recording mentioned a Colonel Autumn.
GID00097345	RALPHIE who? You're still not making sense, ED-E.
GID00097346	You don't have to tell me. I would have beat the crap out of her.
GID00097347	Wow, do you kiss your mother with that mouth?
GID00097348	Sounds like Dr. Whitley was a bit of a rogue element.
GID00097349	Do you record everything that's said around you?
GID00097350	I guess Whitley found a way to keep you from being scrapped. Let's keep going.
GID00097351	So you're trying to get all the way to Navarro? Isn't that in NCR territory?
GID00097352	Oh... right. Navarro. That... sure is far? From where you started?
GID00097353	Whitley turned you loose all on your own? That must have been scary.
GID00097354	Come on, we need to keep going.
GID00097355	What was that?
GID00097356	That sounded bad.
GID00097357	No time to talk - I don't like the look of this place, we should keep moving.
GID00097358	Thanks, ED-E. Let's keep going.
GID00097359	Where did this happen?
GID00097360	Sounds like that kid was pretty fond of you. Why did you leave?
GID00097361	Come on, ED-E, let's go.
GID00097362	Are you... are you saying you can stop this missile?
GID00097363	No, ED-E, I won't let you sacrifice yourself like this. There has to be another way!
GID00097364	Better you than me. Let's do this.
GID00097365	Yeah, I'm beginning to see where you get it from.
GID00097366	He should have obeyed orders. Without respect for the chain of command, the whole unit falls apart.
GID00097367	I think I would have liked him.
GID00097368	Let's get going.
GID00097369	Really? Well, I'd better be careful what I say to you, huh?
GID00097370	No, ED-E, I don't want to hear your recordings of "human mating calls." That's just... wrong.
GID00097371	Yes, ED-E, I'm sure you didn't make the entire trip in one go. It's still impressive.
GID00097372	I'm amazed you didn't break down somewhere along the way.
GID00097373	It sounds like it wasn't easy for him, either.
GID00097374	I bet Whitley would be proud of you for making it this far.
GID00097375	Raiders, huh? Amateurs. I'd have tracked you down and salvaged you for scrap.
GID00097376	You're lucky you got away from them. They would have sold you for scrap in a heartbeat.
GID00097377	No wonder you didn't make it all the way to Navarro.
GID00097378	Sounds like they blew out your primary stabilizing jets. I can't believe you kept going after that.
GID00097379	That bullet probably did something bad.
GID00097380	You gave that up to continue Whitley's mission?
GID00097381	Was it worth it? You still haven't made it to Navarro yet.
GID00097382	Illinois? So that's where you got that plate. The other you, I mean.
GID00097383	Illin-what? Come on, you're making that name up.
GID00097384	What's a Chicago?
GID00097385	But the log said that this kind of encryption would kill you!
GID00097386	It looks like I can still choose the missile's actual target. Maybe we can work with that.
GID00097387	Are you sure this is the only way to stop the missile from launching?
GID00097388	If... if you're really sure you want this, okay. Go ahead and stop the missile. And... goodbye.
GID00097389	I don't care! I'll just change the missile's target myself. I never liked the NCR anyways.
GID00097390	Forget it. The Legion has this coming.
GID00097391	Slow down, slow down - what do you mean you're not the ED-E I know?
GID00097392	You're a copy? Made by the military bases in the Divide? Weird.
GID00097393	This silo must have some pretty advanced engineering facilities to remote-scan you and build copies.
GID00097394	So you're some kind of... robot clone?
GID00097395	There are more robots like you? With the same memory and everything? Interesting....
GID00097396	Never mind.
GID00097397	Whitley was really protective of his Eyebots, huh?
GID00097398	I can't believe they'd approve that. I've met enough robots to know they're more than just machines.
GID00097399	Let's press on. We've got a lot of ground to cover.
GID00097400	He sounds more like a father than an inventor in these logs.
GID00097401	He must have tried to change things. He doesn't seem like the type to let that slide.
GID00097402	I can see why you left that place, then.
GID00097403	I hope those bastards got what was coming to them.
GID00097404	< Storage Node. Do not translate. >
GID00097405	Great. Maybe you'll actually be useful to me, then.
GID00097406	Suddenly a lot of things make more sense.
GID00097407	Is that what you're doing? Trying to find your way home?
GID00097408	Come on, ED-E. We've got to fly far and fly fast if we want to get to the end of the Divide.
GID00097409	Come on, ED-E. Time to move on.
GID00097410	Yes, ED-E, I'm sure RALPHIE the Robot would be very proud of you.
GID00097411	I'll do whatever I can to help you get home - after we deal with things here.
GID00097412	Don't worry, I won't let any mean old generals get you.
GID00097413	Sometimes I feel the same way. Why do you think I became a courier?
GID00097414	What the hell happened? You just ran off on me.
GID00097415	Are you okay?
GID00097416	Must have been an override function piggybacked on that broadcast. That's what pulled you here.
GID00097417	You just heard that signal and flew off. Are you catching the robot crazies or something?
GID00097418	Come on. We're ending this. Right now.
GID00097419	Okay, well, don't do it again. Come on, let's go.
GID00097420	You're at the mercy of your programming, I get it. It's not your fault. Now, are you ready to go?
GID00097421	Whatever he's planning, Ulysses obviously wants you there. Come on - I'd hate to disappoint him.
GID00097422	What happened? You just took off like you finally found home.
GID00097423	Of course I came after you. I wasn't going to leave you behind.
GID00097424	An override frequency? So, what, Ulysses just... called you here?
GID00097425	But why would he do that? It wasn't to lure me here, Ulysses already knew I was coming.
GID00097426	Play the log about your ability to crack encrypted systems.
GID00097427	How about the one where Dr. Whitley yelled at Dr. Grant?
GID00097428	Let's hear the log where Whitley talks about Colonel Autumn's plans.
GID00097429	Play me Whitley's phone call with Colonel Autumn.
GID00097430	I want to hear the recording of when Whitley sent you on your journey.
GID00097431	Let's hear the one where you were attacked by raiders.
GID00097432	I liked the one where the little kid found you.
GID00097433	Play me the trailer for RALPHIE the Robot's Incredible Odyssey.
GID00097434	Yeah, he's probably dead. Guess that means I own you now.
GID00097435	You'd better level with me, trashcan, or I might stuff you back in that pod.
GID00097436	Fine, whatever. Listen, robot: I own you now. Follow me and try to make yourself useful.
GID00097437	Big deal. You're a glorified computer, why bother switching you off to improve you?
GID00097438	If you ask me, Whitley got too invested. It's just robot research, not having a kid.
GID00097439	Spill any of my secrets, and I'll spill your electronic guts. Just so we're clear.
GID00097440	How long ago was this? And you still haven't made it? So much for upgraded navigational systems.
GID00097441	Boo hoo, poor little robot lost his daddy. Stop moping, trash can.
GID00097442	Heh heh. Robot skeet shooting. Sounds fun.
GID00097443	That's what all this was about? Some old pre-War kids' show?
GID00097444	Sounds like a big damn waste of time to me.
GID00097445	Run off on me like that again and I'll recycle you into tin cans. I own you, robot.
GID00097446	You think I'd leave valuable property like you behind? No way. You might be worth some caps one day.
GID00097451	Whatever. I only rescued you for the fire support anyways.
GID00097452	Whatever, trashcan. I really don't give a shit about your problems.
GID00097453	That was a .308 round. Probably hand-loaded - that would have destroyed most robots your size.
GID00097454	I thought all robots were bulletproof.
GID00097455	Nah, I think I'll just go ahead and trigger the launch. I never liked either of those places.
GID00097456	Maybe you better tell me who you are, and what you want.
GID00097457	How are you speaking through ED-E?
GID00097458	Last I heard, Legion didn't use machines as mouthpieces to hide from their enemy.
GID00097459	There's something left down there? Town looks like it was bombed.
GID00097460	The damage here looks like it was caused by underground detonations - on a scale I've never seen.
GID00097461	What is this place?
GID00097462	Are those the bodies I saw in the silo? The soldiers that look like they'd been flayed?
GID00097463	I don't care what you have to say. I only want to know where you are.
GID00097464	Those... troops, NCR or Legion, the ones in the silo were already dead.
GID00097465	Enough talking. You went to a lot of trouble to lure me here, so let's get on with this.
GID00097466	You think I'm coming after you? Think again.
GID00097467	What were the creatures in the underpass?
GID00097468	I'm not planning to go into the Divide after you.
GID00097469	Fine. I'll find this trigger - then I'll come find you.
GID00097470	Those Marked Men in Hopeville - some had strange masks and blades I'd never seen before.
GID00097471	[Legion] Those Legionnaires in Hopeville wore Legion armor - and strange masks and blades.
GID00097472	Some of the flayed Hopeville soldiers looked like NCR... but fought beside others in Legion armor.
GID00097473	[NCR] Those soldiers in Hopeville... were once NCR, I'm sure of it. Why were they with the Legion?
GID00097474	If this is the High Road... where does it lead?
GID00097475	What did you mean, "slower death for the Mojave?"
GID00097476	When you say, "slower death for the Mojave," you mean they're spreading out from the Divide.
GID00097477	I've never seen creatures like that before now.
GID00097478	So... what, they weren't that important then?
GID00097479	You wouldn't have recorded those messages if they didn't matter to you.
GID00097480	I was never a Legion agent.
GID00097481	I haven't listened to them all. If there's time, I will.
GID00097482	If you saw this happen, then how did you survive?
GID00097483	I'm not interested in talking - only getting through this.
GID00097484	This canyon is miles long - maybe longer. Where can I find you?
GID00097485	What happened here?
GID00097486	Enough of this. Tell me where you are.
GID00097487	Forget this. What do you want?
GID00097488	Inhabitants? It doesn't look like anyone's alive down there.
GID00097489	[NCR] Those bodies in the silo were NCR soldiers... some special forces.
GID00097490	[Legion] The dead in the silo, some were Legion Frumentarii, scouts. Assassins.
GID00097491	You were supposed to carry the Chip?
GID00097492	So you refused to deliver the Chip - what, to set me up to die?
GID00097493	If you wanted me dead, why did you wait?
GID00097494	Whatever happened at the Divide, there weren't any survivors.
GID00097495	What are you talking about?
GID00097496	I've never seen corpses mutilated like that.
GID00097497	But... even radiation isn't enough to cause those wounds.
GID00097498	They look like they were skinned... then got right back up.
GID00097499	The rads in this place seem like they would do more damage to them.
GID00097500	If they've become ghouls, the radiation would strengthen them. Heal their wounds - not the scars.
GID00097501	Why would they want to stay here if this place is killing them?
GID00097502	Radiation may keep them alive in areas so physically punishing, it would kill others - even ghouls.
GID00097503	What's here? This place looks wrecked.
GID00097504	Area looks like it was hit with earthquakes... or underground detonations.
GID00097505	You better hope you've got enough ammo when I kick down your door.
GID00097506	The Divide won't stop me from reaching you, trust me.
GID00097507	Other Marked Men had NCR gear - and they weren't carrying masks or blades.
GID00097508	So you're the one who sent the radio message - Ulysses.
GID00097509	Ulysses... that sounds like a Legion name... a Legion hero?
GID00097510	"Ulysses." Not the myth. You're honoring history, not stories.
GID00097511	So... this is about fighting? Or...?
GID00097512	You chose Ulysses because of the "two flags" reference - is that tied to the war in the Mojave?
GID00097513	Wait... so you swore not to kill me? Why?
GID00097514	You're not making any sense.
GID00097515	Forget your name. Back to the job you refused.
GID00097516	"Brothers?" So - you're Legion, too.
GID00097517	A woman in the Legion surprise you?
GID00097518	Is that why you're not Legion anymore, then?
GID00097519	What burrows below? You mean those creatures in the underpass?
GID00097520	Is New Vegas's power a threat to you?
GID00097521	If you're afraid of Vegas and of Mr. House - you should be.
GID00097522	You have a lot of hate for NCR. That kind of hate isn't new in the Mojave.
GID00097523	You've got a better way?
GID00097524	At least they're trying to help the Mojave.
GID00097525	I'm not interested in your politics.
GID00097526	We're too far from Vegas to argue perspective on it.
GID00097527	As obsessed as you are about history, the future's what I prefer.
GID00097528	Don't be quick to discount Vegas. There's more strength there than may seem.
GID00097529	What do you have against Vegas?
GID00097530	House's plans for the future run longer than that.
GID00097531	What did you mean before, "it's a dance?"
GID00097532	Vegas is one of the safest places in the Mojave, and that gives me hope.
GID00097533	Tribes? You mean the Vegas families?
GID00097534	House is more pragmatic than you might think.
GID00097535	I doubt you've ever met House.
GID00097536	Forget this. Keep your opinions about Vegas, I'll keep mine.
GID00097537	The Mojave is behind us. I want to know what's ahead.
GID00097538	Wait... there's more I wanted to talk about. About... all this.
GID00097539	If we share history, then before going forward, I want to know the past.
GID00097540	I'm not interested in talking, I only want to know where to head next.
GID00097541	[Legion] You've been to Denver? That's Legion territory.
GID00097542	Denver? What's that?
GID00097543	"Denver hounds?" Denver's far to the East - Legion territory.
GID00097544	Are you saying... they were here before all this destruction?
GID00097545	Radiation from the War might have created them. Then detonations, quakes, caused them to surface?
GID00097546	I've never been here before, at least not from this road.
GID00097547	You keep saying that, as if you know where I was born - you don't.
GID00097549	"The why of it?" You're the one who needs to answer that - why are you doing this?
GID00097550	I've walked a lot of hard roads, Mojave and before. Doesn't mean anything.
GID00097551	I had nothing to do with this.
GID00097552	You're crazy. Your head's messed up worse than the Divide.
GID00097553	Whatever you believe happened, you have it wrong.
GID00097554	You're still making assumptions about all this.
GID00097555	There is no other supply line to the Mojave beyond the Long 15.
GID00097556	Maybe you should tell me what happened.
GID00097557	You've been to Denver? That's Legion territory.
GID00097558	Whatever they were carrying, they were fighting side by side with the ones in Legion armor.
GID00097559	You said I brought it from the West?
GID00097560	This package... I don't recall it.
GID00097561	I've been West, it's possible, but...
GID00097562	I'm not to blame for Ashton, the Chip, or the Divide.
GID00097563	I'm not responsible for this, there's no way I could have known.
GID00097564	You can't be sure it was me.
GID00097565	I don't understand how a package could have done this.
GID00097566	I had no idea the silo was active until the missile was in the air toward Hopeville.
GID00097567	I didn't intend to set off that missile over the Divide.
GID00097568	I've had enough of this - whatever your game, I'm done.
GID00097569	So you're saying I walked this road once from another direction - from West to East. To home.
GID00097570	There's nothing to keep me from walking out of here and letting you rot.
GID00097571	You wanted me to come to the Divide, I'm here. Now what?
GID00097572	On the High Road, you mentioned NCR and Legion fought here... before and after the Divide?
GID00097573	I'm not done talking to you yet, there's more I want to know.
GID00097574	That's what made the Legion come to the Divide.
GID00097575	So you are part of the Legion. One of their scouts? Assassins?
GID00097576	This is the first I've heard of Legion coming this far West of the Colorado.
GID00097577	So what happened?
GID00097578	I'm not interested in the history of this, we're done talking.
GID00097579	You were planning to attack the NCR here, then.
GID00097580	So the Legion doesn't know what happened here?
GID00097581	How were you planning to attack the Divide?
GID00097582	I found some recordings from you on the road.
GID00097583	So... what, they weren't that important then?
GID00097584	You wouldn't have recorded those messages if they didn't matter to you.
GID00097585	In the logs... you mentioned a tribe called the Twisted Hairs - your tribe?
GID00097586	The logs of the Big Empty mentioned you'd spoken to history.
GID00097587	I found some recordings from you in Hopeville.
GID00097588	When we first spoke in Hopeville, you mentioned you'd sworn not to kill me. Why?
GID00097589	I found more recordings from you on the road.
GID00097590	I... think they tell me... where you were. Things you did.
GID00097591	No, there's a pattern. The more I hear, the more I understand your history.
GID00097592	You're going after the Long 15? That's more miles than Legion can hold.
GID00097593	I found some recordings from you on the road.
GID00097594	I want to talk more about your recordings I found here in the Divide.
GID00097595	So... what, they weren't that important then?
GID00097596	You wouldn't have recorded those messages if they didn't matter to you.
GID00097597	I... think they tell me... where you were. Things you did.
GID00097598	I've been collecting them. Listen to you talk about history enough, maybe I'll understand.
GID00097599	Before I go any farther, I deserve some answers.
GID00097600	There's more I need to know.
GID00097601	I want to know more about this package I delivered.
GID00097602	What's our history? How do you know me?
GID00097603	I don't understand why you didn't kill me in Primm.
GID00097604	[Legion] You didn't kill me in Primm because you still thought I was Legion.
GID00097605	You said you made a promise not to kill me. Why?
GID00097606	But what was it?
GID00097607	Something wrong? You sound... mad... at my robot.
GID00097608	You have a lot of hate for the robot with me. I can hear it in your voice.
GID00097609	What do you mean, "when it woke?"
GID00097610	What do you mean?
GID00097611	[NCR] NCR would have needed this supply line open to reinforce the Mojave - and Hoover Dam.
GID00097612	[Legion] The Legion would want to cut this road off if it had been a supply line to Hoover Dam.
GID00097613	Why did NCR want to keep the route open?
GID00097614	So you blame me for this? An accident?
GID00097615	This place was important to the Legion?
GID00097616	So you're angry because I accidentally brought an explosive to the Divide?
GID00097617	This is revenge for nearly killing you, then.
GID00097618	This package... you said it had markings? What was it?
GID00097619	Why would I have brought it here?
GID00097620	Where is the package now?
GID00097621	[Legion] I didn't side with the Legion until the Mojave.
GID00097622	[Legion] I'll see that you answer for it.
GID00097623	I'm no traitor, and when I walk, I don't hide my presence.
GID00097624	What happened here was an accident. Any anger you have, let it go.
GID00097625	Then you learned the wrong message.
GID00097626	You want the robot? Why?
GID00097627	What's so important about him?
GID00097628	This road leads nowhere. There's nothing in the Divide.
GID00097629	What makes you think this leads home?
GID00097630	What? ED-E?
GID00097631	ED-E's not going anywhere.
GID00097632	If you think you can take it from me, try.
GID00097633	You mentioned "casting off my disguise?" What do you mean?
GID00097634	You're not taking ED-E from me.
GID00097635	The Divide explosion... what, did I kill your family? Your wife - children?
GID00097636	You said "brothers" before. So - you're Legion, too.
GID00097637	When you speak of the dead - you mean the Marked Men? The Legion and NCR?
GID00097638	[NCR] The dead? You mean the Republic troops who were here?
GID00097639	[Legion] The dead? You mean your brothers in the Legion - our brothers.
GID00097640	Sounds like the idea of a woman in the Legion surprises you.
GID00097641	Then what? Did the Divide explosion kill your family? Your wife - children?
GID00097642	If you're Legion, are you angry because I destroyed the Divide supply line instead of you?
GID00097643	[Legion] Killing NCR, cutting off their supply line at the Divide serves Legion, as do we all.
GID00097644	If you blame me for what happened here at the Divide - why do you care?
GID00097645	You think I'm responsible for this. My question is what your tie to this place is.
GID00097646	I'm glad this place burned... obviously, it meant something to you, which makes it even better.
GID00097647	So you believed in this place. What it once was.
GID00097648	If you cared about the Divide, then I'm sorry for what happened here.
GID00097649	All things come to an end. If you put faith in something outside yourself, tough.
GID00097650	And that's why you want me dead.
GID00097651	So this is revenge, then. For destroying the Divide.
GID00097652	If this is why you're angry, you've seen nothing yet.
GID00097653	I don't understand. What message?
GID00097654	Keep talking like that, I'll see you dead.
GID00097655	At least I don't hide behind a machine like a coward.
GID00097656	[Legion] Legion doesn't kill Legion. Caesar's orders?
GID00097657	[Legion] You said you'd sworn not to kill me. If you're Legion, why are we at odds?
GID00097658	[Legion] If I destroyed the NCR in this place, why do you care?
GID00097659	[Legion] Are you angry that this explosion undermined the Legion's plans? It was an accident.
GID00097660	[Legion] Seeing this place. It meant more to you than the Legion?
GID00097661	[Legion] So... when you called me traitor in Hopeville, that title belongs to you.
GID00097662	[Legion] Legion does not kill Legion - but you're not that anymore. I'm going to kill you.
GID00097663	The Divide couldn't stop me, the Mojave couldn't kill me - you don't have much chance.
GID00097664	I still don't understand - why are you doing this?
GID00097665	What about the Marked Men?
GID00097667	Forget this. I'm going to teach you what crossing the wrong Courier means.
GID00097668	I wanted to hear more about Hoover Dam.
GID00097669	I'll let your words answer it, from the tapes you left along the road to the Divide.
GID00097670	"Who are you, who do not know your history?"
GID00097671	The Divide's irradiated... are you sure you want to stay here?
GID00097672	I had other questions.
GID00097673	What's the Courier's Mile? Is that where the Ashton missile hit?
GID00097674	If you meant to kill me, you should have done it long ago.
GID00097675	[Legion] Being Frumentarii kept you from killing me in the past. You have no such defense now.
GID00097676	So... you think dropping bombs on the Mojave is going to solve things?
GID00097677	I need to know why you're doing this - not for my sake, for history's sake.
GID00097678	Your tapes prove you've walked the Mojave, yet learned the wrong lessons.
GID00097679	I believe destroying the symbol is never the answer. Changing it - that's something else.
GID00097680	I don't think that's what's important here.
GID00097681	I'm not talking about NCR or the Legion, I'm talking about our history.
GID00097682	The Legion doesn't abide traitors. What made you turn from the East?
GID00097683	Forget this. If you want an ending to things, let's do this.
GID00097684	I don't care what happens to NCR, but I can't allow you to harm the Legion.
GID00097685	Is this how it must end between us? You followed the East once, you can do so again.
GID00097686	I know one person can break a nation. Legion tests nations, strengthens them - let it do so.
GID00097687	You've wasted enough of my time. Get ready to die.
GID00097688	I've heard enough. You're a Legion traitor, and now you'll die.
GID00097689	What's the history of it?
GID00097690	Can you share the recipe with me?
GID00097691	Sounds useful. Have any to spare?
GID00097693	Are you angry at all?
GID00097695	I could care less about history - and even less about Caesar.
GID00097696	You don't sound happy.
GID00097697	Thought you might be glad House was dealt with.
GID00097698	If Vegas falls apart, seems like more history will be lost.
GID00097701	Who is Legate Lanius?
GID00097702	Enough. Whatever waits at Hoover Dam, I'm ready.
GID00097703	Enough. Whatever waits at Hoover Dam, I'm ready.
GID00097704	What can you tell me about him?
GID00097705	He's just one general. I can handle him.
GID00097706	Well, if I were a slave or a dog, I'd be scared.
GID00097707	Why is he coming West?
GID00097708	Any idea on how to beat him?
GID00097709	He must have a weakness.
GID00097710	He crosses me, I'll break him.
GID00097711	Other Legates?
GID00097712	Other Legates? You mean Graham.
GID00097713	What do you mean?
GID00097715	I'll remember that.
GID00097716	I'll remember that.
GID00097717	We'll leave it to history, then.
GID00097718	We'll leave it to history, then.
GID00097719	In the logs of the White Legs, you mentioned your tribe, and its past.
GID00097720	I don't have anything beyond words to change your mind. If you won't listen, it's over.
GID00097721	You might not believe in nations. I do.
GID00097722	[NCR] Even if you have no faith in the NCR, I do. My actions have proven it.
GID00097723	[Legion] The Legion is stronger than you know. If you would judge them, hear me first.
GID00097724	[Vegas] Even if you have no faith in Vegas, I do... and my actions have proven it.
GID00097725	[NCR] You might not believe in nations. I do.
GID00097726	[Legion] You might not believe in nations. I do.
GID00097727	[Vegas] You might not believe in nations. I do.
GID00097728	[Rep] You might not believe in nations. I do.
GID00097729	Nothing more to say, I've already won. Everything you hate about me, you've become.
GID00097730	If you blame me for the Divide, then let me answer for it, not others.
GID00097731	What happened at the Divide, what I did, was an accident. What you're doing - it's madness.
GID00097732	So, what - you intend to bomb the Mojave?
GID00097733	This is between you and me, not anyone else.
GID00097734	"You can go home again, Courier." Not a message for me, for you.
GID00097736	You can't destroy the West, even with all the missiles here.
GID00097737	Do you think I care if you fire missiles at NCR? Go ahead.
GID00097738	Because it should be given a chance? Its people don't deserve what's about to happen.
GID00097739	One can build a community, make it stronger. You saw it at the Divide, even blamed me for it.
GID00097740	When all seemed lost, you asked it even though you feared the answer.
GID00097741	Well, I just said all that because I'm betting you have some way to stop all this.
GID00097742	I believe that one person can make... or break... a nation. You already know this.
GID00097743	Even if the missiles launch, and I die here - if I can convince you, that's enough for me.
GID00097744	The Divide? What do you mean?
GID00097745	We've already handled everything it can throw at us.
GID00097746	There still might be a way out of this - I just need time.
GID00097747	Vegas earned its right to survive, its people don't deserve what's about to happen.
GID00097748	You told me once I gave life to the Divide. I can do it again, and give life to Vegas.
GID00097749	It was all you could say to prevent from being killed. That's what I'm hoping for here.
GID00097750	If you bomb the West and East... is this how things should end?
GID00097751	There is no honor in murder from a distance, NCR or Legion. You know this from the Divide.
GID00097752	You were trapped, needed to escape, and needed the distraction. It was the key.
GID00097753	The question reminded the ones you spoke to of their purpose, why they cared.
GID00097754	Do you really think these missiles can kill everyone?
GID00097755	If you believe the destruction of the Divide was just, then I cannot stop you.
GID00097756	You said in the logs yourself that technology's a dead road. These missiles will solve nothing.
GID00097758	By your standards? Or history's?
GID00097759	It hasn't proven itself wrong. That's why the Legion and NCR conflict must continue. To test it.
GID00097760	Any symbol deserves a chance to defend itself, by words or acts - not... this.
GID00097761	But your tribe was New Canaan.
GID00097762	The White Legs might as well have been your people.
GID00097763	I'm talking about the past, in the respect they showed you.
GID00097764	You're wrong, and you led them to destroy your tribe at New Canaan.
GID00097766	In the death of that history, another was born, and you grew to respect the White Legs.
GID00097767	But the Twisted Hairs survived, even after Caesar.
GID00097768	So you carry two symbols then - the mark of America and the Twisted Hairs, neither dead.
GID00097769	It's proof that killing a symbol is going to be harder than you thought.
GID00097771	Maybe there's something similar to be said about that Old World flag on your back.
GID00097772	If one Courier built a community, seems to me you can do the same.
GID00097773	You're planning to kill a nation from a distance, just like NCR - just like you accused me of.
GID00097774	Moral ground? What I did by accident, you're doing with purpose.
GID00097776	If my words won't change your mind, what about the messages in the Eyebot?
GID00097777	The Divide survived in you. If it felt like something fighting for, you can rebuild it.
GID00097778	Look, just the fact we're talking should mean you don't want to do this.
GID00097783	It has history inside it. The logs of what's left of "America."
GID00097784	Its logs tell of a place where America survived... may still exist. And it's falling apart.
GID00097785	The Eyebot was a courier, sent to the West, to make contact with the remnants of America.
GID00097786	The package I brought was from Navarro, the Divide scanned ED-E's logs from the Mojave.
GID00097787	You interrupted its journey West, trapped it. If any part of America survived, it's cut off now.
GID00097788	I believe the missiles can't be stopped. If you believe me, though, we might get through this.
GID00097789	The symbol you wear is dead, and you helped kill it. The question is - what will you do to fix it?
GID00097842	<Stealth Protocol::Initiate>
GID00097845	I want you to attack enemies the moment you see them.
GID00097846	<Aggression Level::Aggressive>
GID00097847	I want you not to attack enemies unless I've already engaged them.
GID00097848	<Aggression Level::Passive>
GID00097849	On second thought, stick with me for a little longer.
GID00097850	Yes, I'm sure.
GID00097854	I think we should travel together.
GID00097855	Let's talk about your tactics.
GID00097856	<Tactics Interface::Open>
GID00097857	I want you to change your combat style.
GID00097858	<Combat Interface::Open>
GID00097859	Let's talk about something else.
GID00097860	<Tactics Interface::Close>
GID00097861	That's all. Let's get going.
GID00097862	<Control Interface::Close>
GID00097863	Switch to a melee weapon.
GID00097864	<Weapon Type::Melee>
GID00097865	I want you to use ranged weapons.
GID00097866	<Weapon Type::Ranged>
GID00097867	Let's talk about how close you're following me.
GID00097868	<Follow Distance Protocol::Open>
GID00097869	Stick close to me.
GID00097870	Stay close to me.
GID00097871	<Follow Distance::Close>
GID00097872	Your distance is good. Let's talk about something else.
GID00097873	<Follow Distance Protocol::Close>
GID00097874	All right, you're good. Let's get out of here.
GID00097875	<Control Interface::Close>
GID00097876	Keep your distance. Try to flank them.
GID00097877	<Follow Distance::Far>
GID00097878	Enough about tactics.
GID00097879	<Tactics Interface::Close>
GID00097901	Let's trade equipment.
GID00097902	<Storage::Open>
GID00097903	It's time for us to part ways.
GID00097904	I'm heading back to the Mojave to settle some things.
GID00097905	I'm heading back to the Mojave to settle some things.
GID00097906	Goodbye.
