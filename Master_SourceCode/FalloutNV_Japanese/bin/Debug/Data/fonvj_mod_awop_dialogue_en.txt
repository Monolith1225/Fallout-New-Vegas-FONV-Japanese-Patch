GID00098666	Yeah, that's me and that's my box. Thank you, here take this key and have some caps for the effort.
GID00098667	You look fine to me.
GID00098668	I can help but I don't work for free.
GID00098669	Yeah, just looks like a scratch, but it will still cost you.
GID00098670	You're a right mess, sorry but this is still gonna cost ya.
GID00098671	I don't know how you get in here but I can still help... for a price.
GID00098672	You would not be the first around here. This should be simple enough...
GID00098673	Yeah, that's it... Awesome, everything is still in here. Well, here is the key as promised and some caps for the effort. Thanks again.
GID00098674	OK, if you have any requests just give me a shout.
GID00098675	Hello, my name is Tyra..., Tyra Haggard, nice to meet you.
GID00098676	Goodbye.
GID00098677	Well there is something. There is a ghoul who goes by the name of Blaze, a real pice of shit.
GID00098678	OK, you need party supplies again, you know where to come.
GID00098679	I go by the name Riazanov and I look after the local apartments and fix things in my spare time.
GID00098680	I get a lot of free time to tinker with my electronics on account of I don't get many customers down here.
GID00098681	See Ya.
GID00098682	There is a spare room as it goes but if you want the key then yer gonna have to do me a favor first.
GID00098683	Sure, let me take a look.
GID00098684	Wow, he was still here all along. Thanks for the help... Here take these for the effort...
GID00098685	Hmm, he could be anywhere by now but I have a feeling he never made it out of this town. I'd check the local caves or maybe the Sewer.
GID00098686	I'll mark the locations of a few possibilities on your Pipboy.
GID00098687	Hmm, maybe. When I was first assigned here I had two jobs, first to help maintain order in Goodsrpings.
GID00098688	Second was to track down a Legion spy by the name of Baxter who was last seen in the Saloon.
GID00098689	It's been so long now that Baxter has been pretty much forgotten about but I'm sure HQ would still be interested in his whereabouts.
GID00098690	If you find him and bring me back some proof, preferably his Dog Tags or some other form of ID then I'll make sure you are personally rewarded.
GID00098691	Yeah, A guy turned up in town two weeks back. He'd tunnelled to safety from a local Vault. God knows how. He was in a state of severe shock.
GID00098692	I got a few details out of him. There was something about another Vault launching an attack, then something about giant monsters and squirrels...
GID00098693	He was staying with me until a few days ago when he just left silently in the middle of the night. I have no idea where he went.
GID00098694	Only place I can think of is back to his Vault...
GID00098695	NCR have classified the area as off-limits until they have sufficient troops to check the Vault for supplies.
GID00098696	My guess is that'll never happen but I could still get arrested if I'm seen in the area in the meantime.
GID00098697	I know where his cave entrance is if you wanna check the place out but it sounds like a death trap to me...
GID00098698	Not around here. I think your skills would be of more use elsewhere for the time being.
GID00098699	Good, The Caesar will be pleased. As for your reward I hope this will compensate you for your time.
GID00098700	Well you certainly chose the wrong tunnels to exlore today. This place is a warzone.
GID00098701	According to our interrogations there is a vile poisoner known as Frost who resides in this cesspool of filth.
GID00098702	He's responsible for 90% of the drugs we found in Nipton and The Caesar want's him dead.
GID00098703	Find him and kill him and I'll make sure that you are well rewarded.
GID00098704	Very well, then I suggest you stay out of the way of our bullets.
GID00098705	Go then, there will be time to round up the cowards like you another day.
GID00098706	Good, go now and bring be something to prove when the job is done.
GID00098707	That's great news. We have encountered heavy resistance from the local junkie scum here and are still in combat.
GID00098708	We are purging the junkies and whores from these tunnels. It's proving to be more difficult than I had anticipated.
GID00098709	We have to stay here to clean up, guard these tunnels and see if we can find anything worth salvaging.
GID00098710	Very well...
GID00098711	Well, I do happen to know a recipie which may come in handy out there in the wastes. Here, take it.
GID00098712	...and have a few ingredients on the house. It's not like we're struggling for supplies down here.
GID00098713	Nope, just what's on the menu.
GID00098714	No shit, well it sounds like you wandered into the wrong place at the wrong time... We're in some deep shit here...
GID00098715	Maybe, maybe not, what's the big deal anyway? It's not like people have a high life expectancy around here...
GID00098716	Julie needed the Med-X for her bad back...
GID00098717	The stuff Verona sold in the wastes was just enough to feed the rest of us...
GID00098718	Well it looks like you found us Captain Adventure. Now are you gonna help us out or just get in my way?
GID00098719	These Legion freaks have been slowly killing off our friends. I for one have had enough.
GID00098720	I'm gonna go out there and kill as many as I can and I'll take all the help I can get.
GID00098721	It sounds like you did most of the hard work already. A little mopping up and I'm out of here...
GID00098722	Here, take my master key now in case anything happens. Take anythin' you want... and thanks for helping us out.
GID00098723	I'm getting out of here while I still have the chance...
GID00098724	Typical..., well whatever, just don't get in my way.
GID00098725	You freaks make me sick! I gonna kill you all!
GID00098726	I'll give you the key to my stash room, you can take anything you like. I won't be needing it anymore...
GID00098727	If I get out of here alive I'm heading to a friends safe house up north. The south is becoming way too dangerous these days.
GID00098728	Not without a fight you won't.
GID00098729	Great, take my master key now in case anything happens. Take anythin' you want...
GID00098730	Right, lets get out there and kick some Legion ass!
GID00098731	The Legion dumbass. They're taking over the entire southern region and we're in the way.
GID00098732	We've had problems with them before after one of our group, Verona, was caught with a stash of chems out near Nipton.
GID00098733	They tortured our location out of him and let him go. Then this moring they paid us a visit.
GID00098734	Only five of them. We had to scare them off with out greater numbers.
GID00098735	If they found my chem stash they would have killed everyone so we had no choice.
GID00098736	I guess new they're back with a whole fucking platoon.
GID00098737	I was trying to hide my stash when they arrived. Too late now... they're killing everyone...
GID00098738	Really? Well in that case you may not have come at a better time.
GID00098739	I'm guessing you are new around here so I'll fill you in on what's going on...
GID00098740	Centurion Baculus was assigned here only three months ago and in that time he has killed a staggering amount of people.
GID00098741	Unfortunately nearly half of them have been on our side or our slaves, one or two of them were even personal friends...
GID00098742	The Caesar seems to love this guy, no idea why but he won't hear a bad word said against him... Something about the power of fear...
GID00098743	Michaels here has some medical training and says Baculus is dispalying many of the common signs of Psycho addiction...
GID00098744	Obviously if the Caesar were to be given proof that Baculus was a chem user he would have no choice but to have him executed...
GID00098745	Now we just need to find his stash or catch him in the act. Will you help us achieve this?
GID00098746	Really? Well in that case you may not have come at a better time.
GID00098747	I'm guessing you are new around here so I'll fill you in on what's going on...
GID00098748	Centurion Baculus was assigned here only three months ago and in that time he has killed a staggering amount of people.
GID00098749	Unfortunately nearly half of them have been on our side or our slaves, one or two of them were even personal friends...
GID00098750	The Caeser seems to love this guy, no idea why but he won't hear a bad word said against him... Something about the power of fear...
GID00098751	Michaels here has some medical training and says Baculus is dispalying many of the common signs of Psycho addiction...
GID00098752	Obviously if the Caesar were to be given proof that Baculus was a chem user he would have no choice but to have him executed...
GID00098753	Now we just need to find his stash or catch him in the act. Will you help us achieve this?
GID00098754	Baculus was placed in charge of Cottonwood after Caesar witnessed his efficiency in combat.
GID00098755	I never liked the guy. He seemed like a common thug to me.
GID00098756	Ever since he was put in charge here he has ruled without mercy or forethought.
GID00098757	From the brutal punishments I have heard from others and even witnessed personally I would describe him as a psychotic sadist.
GID00098758	My opinion is he has become a liability and he needs to be dealt with as soon as possible.
GID00098759	Did Baculus send you?
GID00098760	Yes, this is true, though maybe for the wrong reasons. Regardless I don't have time for autograph hunters right now...
GID00098761	Not down here you don't... Kill them before they tell anyone about this!
GID00098762	Well you certainly look like you can handle yourself. Very well. I'll tell you why we are here. Maybe you will be of use to us...
GID00098763	It is now you cowardly spy!
GID00098764	Very well, I trust you for now to keep this information to yourself.
GID00098765	However do not dare to cross me or exspose our plans or I'll personally gut you on a Crucifix.
GID00098766	Excellent. Return to me once we have the evidence we need and we'll bring this bastard down.
GID00098767	OK, you seem trustworthy to me. Maybe you will be of use to us after all...
GID00098768	I don't trust you. Get out of here now before I kill you myself.
GID00098769	The Caesar would become suspicious and doubtless blame me, though if it becomes unavoidable then I'll happily put the bullet in Baculus myself.
GID00098770	Very well, I expected this may happen. This is unfortunate but you have still served us well today.
GID00098771	Take these as a sign of my gratitude.
GID00098772	Excellent work, here's your reward as promised...
GID00098773	Now we have the evidence we need it's time we took down that tyrant once and for all.
GID00098774	That's not your concern. We have some tidying up to do around here, I suggest for now you make yourself scarce.
GID00098775	The Caesar may not be pleased by your actions even if we all are.
GID00098776	Go then...
GID00098777	Ahh, yes, OK, well, the thing is I'm trying to keep that quiet.
GID00098778	I tried explaining it to one guy around here and he went totally crazy and just ran off into the Nightstalker Den screaming about reality.
GID00098779	If you could keep my secrets to yourself I'm sure I would really appreciate it.
GID00098780	OK, Bye
GID00098781	Oh, really, you found our house then.... so you know about....
GID00098782	Oh great, blackmail. Well fine, be like that and take these then piss off.
GID00098783	Yes, that's right. How can I help?
GID00098784	Thanks, here take these as a sign of my appreciation.
GID00098785	Things are a bit mad around here right now. Maybe once things have quietened down a bit more we can have a talk.
GID00098786	Right now I have a lot on so if it's OK with you I'll get back to recalibrating these energy weapons. Those Tech Raiders won't kill themselves.
GID00098787	Of course, you look like the most interesting person I've met in this place. This should be fun.
GID00098788	OK, here you go...
GID00098789	OK, here you go...
GID00098790	OK, here you go...
GID00098791	OK, here you go...
GID00098792	We need some kind of evidence as to what may be causing such powerful ghouls to turn up nearby.
GID00098793	Plus if you can find out what happened to the gang from the Shipping Bunker I'd really appreciate it.
GID00098794	Finally don't forget to kill as many of those mindless ferals as possible and bring me back their ears as proof.
GID00098795	OK, here you go...
GID00098796	Most of it comes from traders needing repairs from Ms Gibson.
GID00098797	She knows I know my way around a reloading bench so she gives em to me. We both take a share of the profits.
GID00098798	Though I have quite a good rep locally now so people know I'm the place to come for bullets around here.
GID00098799	Nice work. Here you go. I'll just take these out back and burn 'em.
GID00098800	Nice work. Here you go. I think I'll just bury these deep enough that I can't smell 'em...
GID00098801	Cool, Here you go...
GID00098802	That's great, keep 'em comin'.
GID00098803	Nice work. Here you go.
GID00098804	That's great. I think I should let you choose your next reward. I have several boxes of ammo you could use and a few grenades.
GID00098805	Just let me know which is most useful for you...
GID00098806	After all the hard work you have done for us I think I'll let you choose your own reward again.
GID00098807	I have three options that may interest you...
GID00098808	I recently became the owner of a stash of rare chems. I don't use 'em myself...
GID00098809	Well, apart from a few Mentats here and there...
GID00098810	Besides those I have a box of spare food supplies. Almost a crate full...
GID00098811	They won't last much longer in this heat so people are put off by 'em but they are still good for recipies at the very least.
GID00098812	Finally I recently managed to get hold of a Tri-Beam Laser Rifle. A skav found it up north near a dead Pack Brahmin.
GID00098813	If you're any good with energy weapons it could be very handy.
GID00098814	Nice work. Here you go. I think that's all I can pay you for for now. Thanks for all the help though.
GID00098815	Oh yeah, one more thing, a few of the local's got together to say thanks for all your hard work.
GID00098816	So this armor is from them...
GID00098817	Yeah, if you think you can handle yourself in a fight we have ourselves an ever worsening Ghoul problem to the East.
GID00098818	I have spoken to Manny about it in the past but he thinks they are coming from or at least heading to Repconn to the west.
GID00098819	I have many reasons to doubt this. First the heavy radiation around the Clark area seems to attract both feral ghouls and geckos in abundance.
GID00098820	There's one main tactical difference between those two monsters...
GID00098821	The Gecks have a lot of trouble opening doors. Ferals still seem to have the knack for that sort of thing.
GID00098822	I have seen for myself ghouls exiting the old Clark Reservoir. I have no idea how many could potentially be down there.
GID00098823	On top of those I have completely lost contact with a local gang of teens who live in a Bunker nearby.
GID00098824	Several very dangerous ferals have been spotted in the area. Bigger and faster than the usual others.
GID00098825	So much so that even the NCR got involved until they lost their entire team to the tunnel system down there.
GID00098826	The place used to be an underground metro shipping hub. It's a rubble strewn maze now for the most part.
GID00098827	The bunker was built so the hub could continue to function even after a war. Seems the tunnels themselves were not built as well...
GID00098828	The gang that lived down there could be pretty obnoxious at times but they were learning and I was helping them out whenever I could.
GID00098829	I'd like to know what happened to them if possible. Also the NCR are very keen on finding out what is causing those mutations.
GID00098830	They even have Snipers posted in town now, though usually they wear plain clothes so as not to draw attention.
GID00098831	If you could find anything that might be causing that I'll reward you in advance. 1000 caps, just like they promised me.
GID00098832	Also there's one final thing. We need some of those ghouls dealt with permanently...
GID00098833	For every 12 severed Ghoul ears you bring me back I'll give you something special from my own collection.
GID00098834	Only those from the east of Novac though - I can't afford for you to take out every Ghoul in the state after all.
GID00098835	Thanks, I'm really glad someone cares enough to help. I'll mark the areas on your Pipboy map.
GID00098836	Here, take these too. Those areas will be pretty heavily irradiated so you'll need some protection.
GID00098837	This explains what happened to the gang in the Bunker and what has been affecting the Ghouls.
GID00098838	Damn that's so sad. Oh well, I guess those are just the harsh realities of life in the wastes...
GID00098839	Thanks for letting me know. Here are your rewards as promised...
GID00098840	OK, enjoy.
GID00098841	No prob, here you go.
GID00098842	Good choice. Have fun.
GID00098843	Sure thing, here you go...
GID00098844	OK, well, I was born into a family of scavangers and as a result I specialise in two things, guns and junk.
GID00098845	Guns are expensive though so I took to learning about ammo instead.
GID00098846	For example did you know that even standard 5mm ammo tears through armor comapred to 5.56? Info like that can save your life.
GID00098847	Anyway a few years ago I wandered into Novac and eventually settled here in Gibsons junkyard. Lets just say it suits my style.
GID00098848	OK, Bye.
GID00098849	Yeah, that's right, each one is a custom job. Mostly my own handywork.
GID00098850	Since the Tech Raiders took the majority of our robot workforce we have had to focus on making our remaining units more efficient.
GID00098851	In fact now I think of it I have a few leftover parts that may be of use to an adventurer like yourself. Here, take these...
GID00098852	Well I could spend the next two hours explaining that to you but I don't think you're gonna get it so lets just leave it there.
GID00098853	No, that's fine, I got used to it. Too much time in the wastes I guess.
GID00098854	Well there's the old sewer just north of the Gas Station. There's some mean Mole-Rats down there but not much else that I am aware of.
GID00098855	Also just to the South East is the old Skydiving Bunker.
GID00098856	It's been taken over by a gang of Powder Gangers so vicious that even other 'Gangers avoid them.
GID00098857	It's a real shame, I heard the family that used to live there were very popular around Goodsprings...
GID00098858	Some guy came crawling out of a Vault near here. I don't know the exact location but speak to Arkus if you want to learn more.
GID00098859	He was staying with her briefly until he left one day without saying why.
GID00098860	There's an old cave on the Cliffside. When times get rough we hunt for Rats around there.
GID00098861	One of the residents snuck in once and spotted some kind of Bunker.
GID00098862	Unfortunately there have been too many rats inside to risk further investigation so far.
GID00098863	Well, there are the Gecko hot-spots which are becoming a real nuisance. Very dangerous places...
GID00098864	Speak to Frankie if you have not already and he'll fill you in on those.
GID00098865	He's been trying to assemble a crew to re-take the Cigarette factory for months now but no one will attempt another attack after the last time.
GID00098866	Far to the south by Crescent Canyon there is an old Train Tunnel. I spent some weeks living there after I arrived in Nevada.
GID00098867	The locals are friendly and may have some supplies to trade though I have not heard from them in a few weeks.
GID00098868	Hmmm.... There was an old Police Bunker I heard about once near Nipton.
GID00098869	I believe it is still active but the gang who used to live there have not been seen around here in years.
GID00098870	I never saw them myself but apparently they were trying to bring back the old-world law system.
GID00098871	My guess is the new world did not take so kindly to that...
GID00098872	Nope, that's all the locations I know of for sure. I can ask around and see if I can find out about any more though. Should be fun.
GID00098873	Nope, nothing worth your attention so far.
GID00098874	You got that right but I guess he gets results at the end of the day...
GID00098875	Sure, here you go...
GID00098876	It's our main HQ in the Southern Region. Used to belong to a General before the old war. He filled the place with art.
GID00098877	Sounds like he never claimed it and eventually it was taken over by one of the gangs. They did a good job of wrecking everything.
GID00098878	The Caesar took it over about 10 years ago after our glorious battle for Cottonwood.
GID00098879	No, not a dog you plum, he's been allowed a female bodyguard. She can't get enough of him from what I hear.
GID00098880	I still have no idea how he persuaded the Caesar to allow it...
GID00098881	I think it drives Baculus crazy having a female around here which would be funny if it was not so scary...
GID00098882	He's our top Sniper. Over 200 confirmed kills. He's something of a celebrity around here, though he does not socialise much.
GID00098883	Still, neither would I if I had a hot bitch following me around everywhere.
GID00098884	No, please don't do that, I'll do anything, here, take these...
GID00098885	I hope that will compensate for my delinquency.
GID00098886	You're full of shit, he'd kill you before he'd kill me. At least he knows me...
GID00098887	That would be Centurion Baculus for now. I'd steer clear of him if I were you. He's got serious anger issues.
GID00098888	If you ask me we'd be better off with Marshal in charge. Baculus has killed more Legion around here than the entire NCR recently.
GID00098889	OK, Caesar be with you.
GID00098890	Sure, he you go...
GID00098891	Fine, here, take them and ask your questsions.
GID00098892	Well in order to keep this place a hidden from Mr House we had to take certain measures.
GID00098893	We built a fake but functional Waste Disposal plant on the first level to mask the Redoubt's entrance.
GID00098894	Since House took over our Vault we strictly limit access to the Redoubt. Whoever goes into the Waste Disposal area has to come back out again.
GID00098895	Sarah and I trade food and notes via lunchboxes every week or so. She won't ever talk about this place though.
GID00098896	OK, if you say so, so you don't work for Mr House then?
GID00098897	Sure..., whatever you say. Just take it easy and tell me what you want.
GID00098898	Wow, the main portal still works? I had no idea, so you don't work for Mr House then?
GID00098899	Only that he's a a mean old fucker. I never met him... I was only 13 when he stormed in and tore the place up. Forced everyone out...
GID00098900	I still remember watching his droids break down and seal off our Vault level by level... searching everywhere... right outside the door...
GID00098901	They never found me though... and I saw everything. Saw them kill the few who refused to leave...
GID00098902	Sarah and Michael managed to work out a way to save the top floor of the Vault but it was too late for the others.
GID00098903	They never speak of it now. House will not allow it.
GID00098904	No, I never met the guy. I'm sure you know a lot more about him than me.
GID00098905	That's great news. Oh my... finally, I can leave... go outside I guess... if I feel like it...
GID00098906	Here, take these keys, they will allow access to the main Vault. You can come and go as you please.
GID00098907	OK, I believe you. Before we talk more I have to tell you that we have kept this Redoubt hidden from House for over ten years.
GID00098908	Now I need you to promise that once you leave here you will not talk about this place to anyone. House has cameras everywhere.
GID00098909	I don't trust you. This conversation is over.
GID00098910	I've got an answer for you.
GID00098911	Fine... I guess this was bound to happen eventually... what do you want then?
GID00098912	Thanks, it's nice to know someone cares, but it's OK, that was a long time ago.
GID00098913	Thanks, here, take this key. It'll open up the Waste Disposal area. You'll have to access the Strip and Vault via the regular route I'm afraid.
GID00098914	Take this note too, it will explain how to gain access through the Waste Disposal room.
GID00098915	That's good to know, even if it was not very funny... but how did you get in here?
GID00098916	Well..., that's good to know, even if it was not very funny... but how did you get in here?
GID00098917	Well I'm not saying anymore to a bitch slave of House.
GID00098918	OK, I'm not saying any more then.
GID00098919	That's good to know, but how did you get in here?
GID00098920	Thanks but no thanks. I... don't like the outside...
GID00098921	Oh thank you so much, I can finally invent some new recipes. Here, take these and thanks again - you just made my whole year.
GID00098922	Well, I guess I'm fairly self sufficent here... I have most of the things I need already...
GID00098923	but if you really wanna help me out there are a few things I could use. Basic stuff, food supplies...
GID00098924	Get me those and I'll give you the key to the Vault Hydroponics area. You can take whatever you need.
GID00098925	Also our Vault was overstocked with certain foodstuffs. I think one of our ancestor Overseer's had a taste for Steak and Eggs.
GID00098926	I can't stand the things anymore myself but I learned a few useful recipes for cooking what we had in healthier and more interesting ways.
GID00098927	Here, take this one now with the list of foods. I'll give you two more as well as the key if you can find me everything on the list.
GID00098928	Sure, just find that stuff on the list I gave you.
GID00098929	I'll have a go.
GID00098930	Sure, if you like... I have lived in this Redoubt for the last ten years, ever since House evicted everyone from our Vault.
GID00098931	My mom left and never came back. Killed by muggers... I guess I raised myself from then on down here.
GID00098932	I read just about everything I could find and moved onto the vid-files. Our Vault's files were mainly filled with Sports and gambling results.
GID00098933	However the sections on medicine, cooking and electronics prooved really handy.
GID00098934	Though I don't have the nerves for medicine I found I could incorporate many of the lessons into my cooking hobby.
GID00098935	The electronics came in handy for rewiring the local mainframes to scan for better info files.
GID00098936	I was also able to prevent the mainframe from reaching decisions based on a random number generator rather than actual data.
GID00098937	Not that that was of any use since everyone left the Vault. I guess I just wanted to prove to myself that I could do it.
GID00098938	You're kidding right, please, this is all I have down here...
GID00098939	Fine, whatever... just take it and leave me alone.
GID00098940	Fuck you. I'm sick of living in fear.
GID00098941	No, really, please that's all I have, search the place if you like - there's nothing left.
GID00098942	Fine, here, that's all I have left. Now just fuck off.
GID00098943	Vault 21 was once a huge and prosperous place. Everything here was controlled by gambling.
GID00098944	Even the most mundane of petty squabbles were worked out with a dice or deck of cards. It makes me kinda sick to be honest....
GID00098945	That's how we lost the Vault. Gambled the damn place away to Mr House. He concreted the whole place up and turfed everyone out.
GID00098946	That miserable old bastard...
GID00098947	This is a hidden Vault Reboubt built below The Strip. We went through huge measures to keep this place a secret.
GID00098948	It was all for nothing... My mother had to abandon her experiments here after Mr House took over our Vault ten years ago.
GID00098949	Mom died not long after leaving the Vault and the Vault itself is now just a low rent Hotel for the local drunks.
GID00098950	Somehow we managed to keep this place a secret throughout it all and now it's my home... my safe place... my prison...
GID00098951	My name is Rose. I live here. Now was there anything else you wanted to know?
GID00098952	OK, Bye.
GID00098953	Whatever.
GID00098954	Nice try hero but rules are rules. We need to be prepared for the future.
GID00098955	Heh, you're right there. We really owe you one for that. In fact here, take these from my personal stash as a thankyou.
GID00098956	Good to see you again.
GID00098957	I used to be a shapeshifter but for some reason I'm stuck in this form here in this world. Luckily I still retain my regenerative powers.
GID00098958	This pretty much makes me invincible. On top of that I have a key to our old shack. Who knows, you may find something useful in there.
GID00098959	OK, look, I'll level with you, you seem to be more open minded than most... I'm not even like you. I'm an Alien, from another planet....
GID00098960	When I first found the Underground I thought it would be a lot of fun, and it was. Though to be honest this place bores the tits of me now.
GID00098961	Now I just wanna get back out there and see something other than rocks.
GID00098962	That's great, thank you, and as promised here's the key to our old shack. OK then so what next?
GID00098963	Of course, must have slipped my mind during all that fighting. That's great news thank you - in that case let's just go and have some fun.
GID00098964	That's great news, well, anything you wanna know just ask.
GID00098965	Well I used to be a shapeshifter but for some reason I'm stuck in this form here. Luckily I still retain my regenerative powers.
GID00098966	This pretty much makes me invincible. On top of that I have a key to our old shack. Who knows, you may find something useful in there.
GID00098967	OK, what next?
GID00098968	Sure go right ahead.
GID00098969	OK, look, I'll level with you, you seem to be more open minded than most... I'm not even like you. I'm an Alien, from another planet....
GID00098970	When I first found the Underground I thought it would be a lot of fun, and it was. Though to be honest this place bores the tits of me now.
GID00098971	Now I just wanna get back out there and see something other than rocks.
GID00098972	Well I come from the planet Hedrolaxia which is a place of extreme Hedonism. The lifestyle was not for me though so I left for Earth.
GID00098973	When I first arrived I managed to piss off the locals very badly. I'm used to having whatever I wanted whenever I wanted it at home...
GID00098974	I ended up just taking whatever I wanted and using my powers to get away with it. It was not long before a gang of irate locals tracked me down.
GID00098975	Luckily Charlie arrived just in time and dragged me out of there before the military showed up.
GID00098976	Hmmm, to cut a long story short... Our reality and yours are not the same. In our reality there is a war raging on all immortals like us.
GID00098977	There is another like us. He wants to be the only immortal left and has aligned himself with the governments of our world to kill us all.
GID00098978	We were teleported here to this reality by an entity who refers to himself as 'God' who lived with us for a while, apparently for our own saftey.
GID00098979	Not long after a few of us discovered The Underground and I chose to stay and help out around here for a while.
GID00098980	Then you showed up and here we are.
GID00098981	Not like me no, well, not exactly. We are all immortal for one reason or another so we tend to stick together.
GID00098982	Apart from myself there is Charlie who says he is an 'Angel of Retribution', Steve, a vampire,..
GID00098983	Danny who is a Super Soldier, Matt, a ghost, Tony, a time-travelling inventor and finally Nova, Tony's robot assistant and all around slave.
GID00098984	I hafta admit, I'm actually starting to miss those guys.
GID00098985	It's not far from the New Vegas Medical Clinic. We built it in the middle of no-where. Well, near enough.
GID00098986	If you let me come with you I'll show you the way and give you a key.
GID00098987	No problem, here let me have a look.... Ok there that should do it.
GID00098988	OK, fair enough. I guess I'll stick around here for a while longer if you change your mind.
GID00098989	OK, cool, will do.
GID00098990	Yeah, up to a point. Let me take a look.
GID00098991	That's fantastic. I can't wait to listen to these. Here, take this, it's my old rifle... It's powerful enough to scare Deathclaws.
GID00098992	Well, I guess that's it for now. If I find the loactions of any more discs I'll get back to you. Cheers friend.
GID00098993	You bet. I'm not gonna lie to you though, these last three are not gonna be easy to get to. At least one is in Tech Raider territory.
GID00098994	You still up for this?
GID00098995	OK, great - I seriously cannot thank you enough for this but I'll make sure there is something special waiting on your return.
GID00098996	Here, let me upload the co-ordinates...
GID00098997	That's fantastic. I can't wait to listen to these. Here, take this, it's my old rifle... It's powerful enough to scare Deathclaws.
GID00098998	Well, I guess that's it for now. If I find the loactions of any more discs I'll get back to you. Cheers friend.
GID00098999	I'm a Sergeant with the NCR. Many of us have been re-assigned to maintain our hold over friendly settlements.
GID00099000	It's mostly to keep the trade routes open but to be honest I think it's a PR exercize too.
GID00099001	Despite our greatest efforts we still don't have the best reputation around these parts.
GID00099002	I had friends here once upon a time. Used to be a good town... well, it still is but after Primm fell many settlers moved north.
GID00099003	People just wanna escape the Powder Gangers. Can't say that I blame 'em. This place is wide open for attack.
GID00099004	No, sorry but supplies are stretched too thin as it is.
GID00099005	OK, you do look like you could use the help. Just don't go around telling people about this OK...
GID00099006	Yeah, if you heading south east stay away from the old Correctional Facility. The convicts have taken over and all hell has broken loose.
GID00099007	Nope, sorry.
GID00099008	Yeah, you seem trustworthy enough. If ever you make it to Camp McCarren head into the terminal, right to the back of the building.
GID00099009	There's a good fiend of mine works down there, goes by the name of Conteras He has one of the best ammo supplys in the whole NCR.
GID00099010	Just don't ask where he gets it all from.
GID00099011	Nope, just look after your weapon and watch your back.
GID00099012	I volunteered for a Peace Keeping role here. After Primm fell many of our forces got re-assigned.
GID00099013	On top of the local Powder Ganger threat we have had everything from giant rats to the walking dead come through here the last few days...
GID00099014	So someone needs to keep an eye out over these folk. Plus, I used to know some people around here. Lived in a bunker to the east
GID00099015	Dead now. Killed by Powder Gangers. They killed my backup too. Now it's just me and McCarren refuse to send more troops to defend a small town.
GID00099016	No, not really, I've never been down there myself. From what little I have heard I'm grateful for that.
GID00099017	Very well...
GID00099018	OK, here you go...
GID00099019	OK, after you...
GID00099020	OK, following from a distance...
GID00099021	Thanks.
GID00099022	OK, guarding local area.
GID00099023	OK, holding position.
GID00099024	Well, it looks like we have accomplished our mission, thanks to you. I wish I had something to give you... I guess I'm gonna head back to base...
GID00099025	Hey, good to see you again, anything I can do for you?
GID00099026	Huh, oh... what the... shit... I must have passed out....
GID00099027	I'm busted up pretty bad here... I don't think I'm dying..., busted ribs maybe... dislocated left shoulder... pain is fucked up...
GID00099028	I hate to ask a stanger for help but I think I can fix myself up if you have a spare Doctors Bag. Even a dose of Hydra would do the trick.
GID00099029	Thanks, I owe you one...
GID00099030	Thanks, I owe you one...
GID00099031	Fucking typical... Just get it over with scumbag.
GID00099032	Shit, I don't know, recon is not my speciality. From the briefing I remember mention of a pre-war underpass... I guess we must be in that.
GID00099033	We knew there must have been a cave around here somewhere, where all the Deathclaws were hiding.
GID00099034	I never expected anything like this though....
GID00099035	Damn right I do. Lets go kick some Deathclaw ass.
GID00099036	Whatever, I 'aint goin anywhere in a hurry... If you find anything you know where I am.
GID00099037	There's nine of us, or there used to be anyway. Me and Franco are the Heavy support, then theres the Sarge, a damn fine leader.
GID00099038	Bruce and Vizzy are our scouts, Nola is our medic, then theres The Lizard, our mute trapper.
GID00099039	Kendo is our top sniper and finally theres Merrek, whos near useless apart from his lockpick skills.
GID00099040	If any of 'em are left alive in there I need to find them... and if not, kill as many of those bastard Deathclaws as I can...
GID00099041	I'm part of an NCR project, 'X13'. Top secret but it's not like I give a shit right now.
GID00099042	We're all mutants, freaks of nature or in some cases, like myself, just drug fuelled experiements, trained to fight on behalf of the NCR.
GID00099043	Vizzy was a psycher, they say Kendo could see the future and Sarge could bend girders in a bad mood.
GID00099044	We all had a speciality. We we're meant to be the toughest sqaud in the entire NCR, capable of holding Hoover Dam without backup if need be.
GID00099045	This was our first real mission. The briefing seemed simple enough. Loacte the source of the Deathclaw infestation near Primm and kill 'em all.
GID00099046	We never expected anything like this, even Kendo was surprised. As soon as we stepped into this place I knew we were in trouble.
GID00099047	We dropped the first few easy enough. Stuck together, kept it tight, picked out specific targets each as we were trained.
GID00099048	When the big Alphas started showing up we we're in trouble. Nothing was dropping them, even headshots...
GID00099049	The squad scattered and I took a blow that threw me half the length of this room... I guess I crawled to safety and passed out...
GID00099050	That's all I remember...
GID00099051	Bye.
GID00099052	I'm Major Cobb, and I'm a veteran of the Underground. If anything should happen to Colonel Hoff I would assume command of our army.
GID00099053	No, we still have too many problems in the South East. Talk to Seargeant McMillan in Dead Man's Pass.
GID00099054	If you can solve his problems then I will allow you to take a squad of troops into battle with the Tech Raiders.
GID00099055	No, we have too many problems as it is. An assault now would leave us vunerable to an attack from the South East.
GID00099056	On top of this there may be a spy about. Go talk to Colonel Hoff in the Power Plant or Sergeant McMillan in Dead Man's Pass if you want to help out.
GID00099057	No, we still have a spy in our midst and we can't draw up plans for an offensive when we do not know who we can trust.
GID00099058	After all of your achivements so far I would be a fool to say no.
GID00099059	However there are a number of things you should know before you lead your attack.
GID00099060	The Tech Raider HQ is defended by hundreds of well armed lunatics. They have even started to graft armor on to some of thier recruits.
GID00099061	Even our best weapons made little impressionon these troops and we were unable to recover the armor from the few we have killed.
GID00099062	If you are going to attempt this assault I fear even Iapicca's team will not be sufficuient backup.
GID00099063	If you can find troopers Holstromm and Wessels I'm sure you can persuade them to help out too.
GID00099064	Unfortunately I cannot spare my own team. If your plan fails you may bring down a storm of shit on own home.
GID00099065	If that happens, we'll need people around to clear up.
GID00099066	Just report to Corporal Iapicca in Trapper's Pass when you are ready to go.
GID00099067	Your main enemies will the the Tech Raiders, thier robot guards and the Nightstalkers.
GID00099068	Also back in the day we had uncomfirmed reports of Caesar's Legion troops around the Boulder City Sewer area.
GID00099069	About 6 years back we had a spy in the Tech Raider camp. Real method actor, a total piece of shit when he wanted to be.
GID00099070	He reported that the Tech Raiders had been involved in a skirmish down in Boulder Sewer with foes dressed like the Legion.
GID00099071	There are emergency access tunnels down there that lead to our old Transit system. Somehow the Legion must have gained access.
GID00099072	From the sound of it the Tech Raiders got thier asses handed to them. Never thought the Legion would do us a favor but there you go.
GID00099073	Anyway back when we owned the area we had to seal the place off. The whole area was a radioactive dumping ground after the War.
GID00099074	If you have already reclaimed our HQ don't expect Iapicca's squad to follow you down there.
GID00099075	They managed to infest one of our incomplete sectors after the Tech Raiders took over.
GID00099076	Now the Raider's encourage them. They even breed loyal Nightstakers and use 'em as a meat shield.
GID00099077	I still don't know how they managed that. I guess they're both mean enough to respect each other.
GID00099078	They have all sorts in there, from Protectrons to Rob-Co Security-Bots, just like those outside the strip.
GID00099079	They have access to our main robotics labs and you can expect them to be active and hostile.
GID00099080	If I were you I'd stock up on EMP gear before trying to take over the HQ itself. The place is filled with turret emplacements.
GID00099081	The Tech Raiders form the bulk of the forces amassed against us in The Underground.
GID00099082	They are genrally very well armed on account of they have access to our main armory.
GID00099083	Expect to run into troops carrying advanced energy weapons and wearing modified Metal or Power Armor.
GID00099084	We still know little about the crew behind them. All I know is they are well trained and likely to be even better armed than thier troops.
GID00099085	Some ex-BOS have mentioned in briefings that thier armor sounds very much like that used by a force known as The Enclave.
GID00099086	By all reports that organisation should no longer exist but if it is the Enclave in control, from what I have heard we have a powerful enemy indeed.
GID00099087	No, Masseling may be the only assest we have capable of striking fear into these bastards. I can't risk loosing him.
GID00099088	You are probably right. OK, you can take Masseling. I just hope you know what you are doing...
GID00099089	No, most of our Energy Weapon specialists end up in the science division. I can't think of anyone spare.
GID00099090	Yes, I agree. Mlix should be in the Trooper Barracks by the range. I guess under the circumstances she should go along with you.
GID00099091	Wow, that's incredible. We can't thank you enough for this. Here, take these supllies as a reward.
GID00099092	So I heard, that's a mighty impressive achivement and everyone around here owes you a real debt.
GID00099093	I promished you a reward and I have gathered a bunch of supplies and caps as a way of saying thaks.
GID00099094	It's nothing compared to the resources you have recovered for us but I hope it goes some way to compensate you for your efforts.
GID00099095	No, not right now. Try checking with the Colonel in the Power Plant or McMillan in Dead Mans Pass.
GID00099096	No..., not unless you feel like lauching a full scale offensive against the Tech Raiders...
GID00099097	OK. Bye.
GID00099098	I'm Corporal Iapicca and it's my job to watch over this end of Trapper's Pass.
GID00099099	At the first sign of a Tech Raider attack we have orders to fall back, alert the others and defend the Reactor.
GID00099100	Glad to hear it. You don't know how long I have been waiting for this... OK squad, get ready to move.
GID00099101	No chance, I wish we could but we have too many problems around here is it is without stirring up that hornet's nest.
GID00099102	After all the good work you have done clearing out the East and catching our spy I sure as hell don't see why not.
GID00099103	You'll have to let Major Cobb know first through. Check back with me once you have his permission.
GID00099104	OK, but if you wan't any of my stuff you'll have to trade for it.
GID00099105	Well, we're through here. We now have to hold this area in case any Raiders return.
GID00099106	I can't thank you enough for your help but I can give you my rifle as as sign of my appreciation. It's never let me down.
GID00099107	When you get chance you may wan't to report back to Major Cobb. I'm sure he will have something for you too.
GID00099108	Good luck with whatever path you choose to take next.
GID00099109	I'm right behind you.
GID00099110	No, we have our orders and we are not moving until that changes.
GID00099111	OK, I'll go with you. My squad must stay here though... Are you really sure you want to do this now?
GID00099112	Thanks.
GID00099113	OK, lets do this.
GID00099114	OK. I'm Waiting.
GID00099115	OK, Guarding Area.
GID00099116	OK. Bye.
GID00099117	No, sorry, not while I'm on duty.
GID00099118	Hell, after what you have done for us it would be the least I can do. Take these, I'm sure they will come in handy.
GID00099119	The is the Freetech Boradcast Tower and safest entrance to The Underground in all of the Mohave.
GID00099120	I'm Corporal Lam, and it's my job to watch over this area and make sure no Fiends or Tech Raiders try to sneak in.
GID00099121	The Fiends in particular have become a contant nuisance as of late. I believe they have joined with our old enemy the Tech Raiders.
GID00099122	Now they are contantly pestering anyone who comes near us despite the best efforts of our snipers.
GID00099123	No, we have too many problems right now to go worrying about other people troubles.
GID00099124	Check out the Bar in the Market sector. They have a steady supply of free fresh food for our residents.
GID00099125	I'm sure they would not mind sharing some with you.
GID00099126	It's our home... Well, some of it is anyway. It used to all be ours...
GID00099127	Between mutants and Raiders we have had to abandon over three quarters of the place.
GID00099128	It was built as a safe haven from the War around 200 years ago. There's caves down there as big as whole cities.
GID00099129	Very well...
GID00099130	Now we are through here, if you so choose, I would like to join you. I have not had this much fun in longer than I can remember.
GID00099131	I'm right behind you.
GID00099132	Following from a distance...
GID00099133	OK, guarding local area.
GID00099134	Excellent news. Lets go and show those Raiders who are the real dominant force around here.
GID00099135	Thank you.
GID00099136	Holding position...
GID00099137	First I'm gonna thank you, not only are we gonna get out of here but we're gonna be heroes.
GID00099138	Here, I found this stuff in the room I was hiding in. I figure you'll find more use for them than me. Thanks again, you really saved my skin.
GID00099139	Hey, thanks again for your help.
GID00099140	Well, if all those Deathclaws are dead I'm gonna thank you stanger and get the hell out of here.
GID00099141	OK, just don't take all my stuff...
GID00099142	I'm right behind you.
GID00099143	OK, following from a distance...
GID00099144	OK, I'll keep a watch over this area.
GID00099145	OK, waiting here...Don't forget about me...
GID00099146	Well, you seem friendly enough, I just hope your as trustworthy as you appear... OK, I'm in.
GID00099147	Yeah, whatever, I don't have to put up with either of ya if I don't want to.
GID00099148	Yeah, well, whatever you say tough guy.
GID00099149	Oh, you've got to be kidding me...
GID00099150	Hey, if Bulls with you, then so am I...
GID00099151	I dunno... I don't wanna go back out there... Those things man... what the fuck...?
GID00099152	OK, You are right... I just hope you know what you are doing...
GID00099153	No chance, you are on your own.
GID00099154	Thanks boss.
GID00099155	OK..., fine, I'm coming, just take it easy OK...
GID00099156	No way man... No chance, I'd rather take the chance youre bluffing than risk my neck out there again.
GID00099157	OK, Bye.
GID00099158	Too right, we were awesome in there. Thank you so much for showing up and saving my ass.
GID00099159	Here, I don't have much on me but I'm sure these will come in handy in the future. Thanks again.
GID00099160	Hey, it's good to see you again. I'm fine thanks. Is there anything I can do for you?
GID00099161	You mean you killed all those Deathclaws? Wow, cool, here take there as my way of saying thankyou.
GID00099162	OK, here you go.
GID00099163	OK, I'll be right behind you.
GID00099164	OK, I'll be watching our six.
GID00099165	OK, guarding local area.
GID00099166	OK, hurry back.
GID00099167	Glad to hear it, this place is a nightmare. I don't know if any of the others made it.
GID00099168	Oh, fuck no, I'm not going that easy...
GID00099169	Yeah, the sooner the better.
GID00099170	Thanks, much appreciated.
GID00099171	OK, Bye.
GID00099172	No, to be honest I never have the time to look around for spies. However I wish you the best of luck if that is you aim.
GID00099173	The names Rogan stranger. I spend my days watching over the road for Raiders and mutants.
GID00099174	I used to do it for free but now Frankie pays me a good wage. Rusty the robot can be a bit unreliable in a firefight.
GID00099175	Before that I was a drifter. This place is the closest to a home I have found.
GID00099176	Yeah, I know enough to stay away. If you wanna go down there stock up on HP and JHP ammo where possible first.
GID00099177	The critters that live down there don't have access to the same armour we do.
GID00099178	I hear there's still a safe access point far north of here, not far from the Sunset Sass HQ, but I've never been there myself.
GID00099179	OK, see ya...
GID00099180	Sure, have a look....
GID00099181	Really... thanks, I guess...
GID00099182	I can try...
GID00099183	I killed a few of the wrong people and now I live here. I hate it, but the others seem to like me. I guess coz I'm good with chems and shit.
GID00099184	I can sell you some of my gear if you like... I got good shit. I have it well hidden though, if you kill me you'll never find it.
GID00099185	Also I know enough to fix up broken crap like weapons, at least if I have enough parts around. Lucklily this place is full of junk.
GID00099186	Well, it's a junk filled craphole filled with rapists and murderers. Drenzer's managable enough. He keeps the others in line and well away from me.
GID00099187	Well... most of the time anyway...
GID00099188	One thing you should know.... There's a big Bank right next door to this building. It's got a vault crammed with loot...
GID00099189	We figured the door would be blastproof and a frontal raid would have alerted the NCR so we tunnelled through the back instead.
GID00099190	We got in OK, somewhow the Vault had been opened already but most of the safes were still locked and filled with stuff.
GID00099191	We were in about two minutes before the flood came... Insects... Dozens of 'em, all shapes and sizes...
GID00099192	Mantises, Rats, Scorps, Roaches, you name it... and they were all working together... It was so fucked up....
GID00099193	We laughed at first and stomped on 'em untill the big ones showed up... Then we were screwed. Over a dozen of us were killed. We had to fall back.
GID00099194	If you're gonna check the area out watch yourself and remember - those dumb mutants can't open up any doors...
GID00099195	We trapped the area around there pretty good too so I recommend keeping your eyes peeled and light on.
GID00099196	Whatever, I can't say I don't have this coming. Just make it quick.
GID00099197	OK, Bye...
GID00099198	OK, here you go...
GID00099199	OK, here you go...
GID00099200	OK, here you go...
GID00099201	OK, here you go...
GID00099202	OK, here you go...
GID00099203	OK, here you go...
GID00099204	Orders from Iapicca - I'm to guard this area. It looks like we're done here. Thanks for you help.
GID00099205	Cobb just radioed through to say I can stick with you if you need an extra pair of hands out there.
GID00099206	We're done here. My orders are to guard this area. Nice work in there.
GID00099207	Thanks to you we have our HQ back. Now we have to guard the place in case any Raiders return.
GID00099208	We did it! We beat those Raider scum. Thank you so much for your help. I wish I could join you but I have to stay and guard this area.
GID00099209	Yeah, we taught those bastards a lesson. Thanks to your assistance we now have our HQ back. My orders now are to guard it.
GID00099210	I'm right behind you.
GID00099211	I'm right behind you.
GID00099212	I'm right behind you.
GID00099213	I'm right behind you.
GID00099214	I'm right behind you.
GID00099215	I'm right behind you.
GID00099216	OK, after you...
GID00099217	OK, after you...
GID00099218	OK, after you...
GID00099219	OK, after you...
GID00099220	OK, after you...
GID00099221	OK, after you...
GID00099222	Great, It's about time. Lets go.
GID00099223	OK, I'm ready to go.
GID00099224	Thanks.
GID00099225	Thanks.
GID00099226	Thanks.
GID00099227	Thanks.
GID00099228	Thanks.
GID00099229	Thanks.
GID00099230	OK, Guarding area.
GID00099231	OK, Guarding area.
GID00099232	OK, Guarding area.
GID00099233	OK, Guarding area.
GID00099234	OK, Guarding area.
GID00099235	OK, Guarding area.
GID00099236	OK, holding position.
GID00099237	OK, holding position.
GID00099238	OK, holding position.
GID00099239	OK, holding position.
GID00099240	OK, holding position.
GID00099241	OK, holding position.
GID00099242	Good. I've been looking forward to this day for a long time...
GID00099243	OK, Bye.
GID00099244	OK, Bye.
GID00099245	OK, Bye.
GID00099246	OK, Bye.
GID00099247	OK, Bye.
GID00099248	OK, Bye.
GID00099249	As a matter of fact I do, but I gotta tell you it aint goin' cheap. The place is stuffed full of functioning pre-war tech
GID00099250	I promised the owner I wouldn't let it go for less than 5000 caps.
GID00099251	Wow, nice work. Here's your key. Your new pad is right next to Doc Mitchells house. I hope you like it...
GID00099252	Have a look...
GID00099253	My name's Adornetto and Iv'e lived in The Undergound my entire life. Iv'e seen, fought and lived through it all.
GID00099254	The 'Lurks, the Raiders, the Nightstalkers, even damn Roaches the size of dogs...
GID00099255	I might be a barteneder most of the time but I'm a trooper at heart. Only thing is I have a knack for brewing the local beer.
GID00099256	People tell me I'm doing more good in here than by putting my life on the line out there. I guess I can't complain...
GID00099257	Yeah, take as much as you like, Dagmar next door donates most of it and I get some supplies from some of the others too.
GID00099258	A lot of people down here are very happy to have a regular source of good beer so they like to look after me.
GID00099259	OK, have a good one...
GID00099260	The damn Tech Raiders is what happened, took over our armory and used our own weapons against us.
GID00099261	I heard there was someone else involved but you would have to ask one of the military officers for more details...
GID00099262	Hmmm, not that I can think of... I don't see many unfamiliar faces around here and everything seems normal.
GID00099263	My name is Chafik and I'm in charge of organising and updating our supply inventories.
GID00099264	Did you know we have enough food in particular to last our current population for approximately 400 years...?
GID00099265	This place was designed to house hundreds of people but it never got finished. Luckily for us the storerooms were.
GID00099266	We have access to some incredible technology here, stuff I never even imagined could exist....
GID00099267	If only we were still in control of our own Militay HQ... Then we could do some real good up in the wastes too.
GID00099268	OK, see ya...
GID00099269	What about my stories? Leave my stuff alone or I'll beat you right up you toilet.
GID00099270	Are you talking to me?...
GID00099271	Hmmm, can't really say that I have. I can vouch for everyone who lives in this block too, Iv'e known most of 'em since I was a young 'un.
GID00099272	I'm Coquet and I've been an Underground resident for about 18 years now.
GID00099273	It's a great place to live - the ladies, the booze, the music, the company, it's all good...
GID00099274	I spend a lot of my time looking after our little Deathclaw pal Damm. He won't speak like his father but he's smart and pretty friendly too.
GID00099275	No worries, catch ya later.
GID00099276	Nice work, Smorgan's been an asshole spreading rumors for ages..., I'm not suprised he turned out to be a spy...
GID00099277	Here, take these as a way of saying thankyou...
GID00099278	Here, take a look...
GID00099279	I can't say that I have..., nothing suspicious anyway...
GID00099280	I guess all I can do is wish you the best, but if you do find out who it is then please let me know. Iv'e been trying to figure it out myself.
GID00099281	Well, I'm ex-NCR, my family were from California and moved out here about thirty years ago. I heard about The Underground on my last tour.
GID00099282	Most people from outside of Nevada think this place is a myth. I was amazed to actully find it, even with Freetech radio all over the airwaves.
GID00099283	Now I put my survival skills to use creating unusual and invigorating recipies from the wasteland and local cave's sparse food supply.
GID00099284	Luckily we have supplies in storage for more than ten times our current population to live healthily for another fifty years or so...
GID00099285	That is if I got my math right....
GID00099286	OK, come back any time you need a good meal.
GID00099287	Sssssspishussss.... errr...yeerr... Smorgaaan muk Eddieh spishusss.
GID00099289	Buh byee
GID00099290	OK, I hope to see you again soon.
GID00099291	No prob. Let me take a look.
GID00099292	Sure thing, have look around...
GID00099293	Well, my name is Elias and I have lived in the Underground since I was born. I have been outside plenty of times but I prefer it down here.
GID00099294	Besides I have my Armor stall to look after and I don't know what they would do without me here in The Underground.
GID00099295	The troopers need someone to look after thier armor, what with all the potential threats down here.
GID00099296	I spend most of my time cross stitching over armor plates and soaking clothes in various homemade hardening agents. It's a living...
GID00099297	Collins?... I don't think the FEV process did him any favours. In his rare moments of clarity he seems to have the mind of a teenager or child...
GID00099298	He knows what side he's on though and he fights like a true Headbanger.
GID00099299	I'm Fabrie and I came here from Black Mountain after Tabitha took over the place...
GID00099300	Back then the Headbangerz owned Spring Mount and they seemed like a good bet for a new home.
GID00099301	Things turned to shit not long later when Caleb turned up with his goons. I chose my side and the rest is history.
GID00099302	Now I spend most of my time fixing up broken weapons, though before you ask, no, I cannot fix conventional firearms.
GID00099303	Yeah, it looks like you have all the parts I need. Nice work finding everything. Just wait there one moment...
GID00099304	Ok, there you go, try not to burn yourself.
GID00099305	Yep, it looks like you have all the parts I need. Just wait there a moment...
GID00099306	...There you go. Have fun banging a few heads for me...
GID00099307	I can but you are gonna need a lot of parts if you want a beast like mine.
GID00099308	I'll need a a modified Incinerator, that's one with a big M on it, a fire hoze nozzle, 4 lumps of scrap metal and the following very rare parts...
GID00099309	1 High Density Pilot Light, 1 Kinetic Power Booster Pack and a Precision Targeting Chip.
GID00099310	They wont be easy to find though... The only place you'll find most of those parts is on one of Caleb, Klaus or Scabs' Incinerators...
GID00099311	Here, take this note if you need reminding which parts you need...
GID00099312	No, we have very limited resources here. However, if you can find the correct parts I can build some very powerful weapons for you.
GID00099313	At the moment I am only set up for a Modified Heavy Flamer or a Hyper-Super Sledge. Just let me know which you are interested in...
GID00099314	Sure, they're not so hard to make... I'll need a few things first though...
GID00099315	Bring me a standard Super Sledge, 4 bundles of scrap electronics, 3 Fission Batteries and a steam gauge assembly.
GID00099316	Here, take this note in case you need reminding which parts you need....
GID00099317	OK, watch your back out there...
GID00099318	Suspicious..., Well I did see someone sneaking around the apartments not long ago but that was you. Does that count?
GID00099319	Nope, it's been real quiet around this Sector recently.
GID00099320	I'm Gieling and Iv'e lived down here for nearly 80 years now....
GID00099321	I guess I sucked up too many rads when Reactor B went critical during the 'Lurk invasion... Those were some bad times.
GID00099322	Life as a ghoul aint so bad though, especially around these parts. and now I spend most of my time tending to the plants.
GID00099323	No, like I told him Wiltshire needed it for some kind of 'micro-speaker' project... I aint seen it since....
GID00099324	Bye.
GID00099325	OK, see ya.
GID00099326	Sure, let me take a look.
GID00099327	Sure, I don't have much but it's all good stuff...
GID00099328	I'm Hayward and I'm the one who fixed up all the weapons around here to fire properly.
GID00099329	I have a few weapons and parts that I can sell you, as long as you have the caps...
GID00099330	Suspicious..., hmmm, well I nearly caught someone sneaking around our Mini Vault about a week ago.
GID00099331	They ran when they heard the doors go. I figured it was just one of the ravers looking for booze or drugs...
GID00099332	That happens sometimes... Anyway it looked like they were wearing leather armour if that's any help.
GID00099333	Well they call me Hermsen and I'm a rare example of a New Vegas success story.
GID00099334	I came into some money after delivering a package for Mr House about four years back. I couldn't figure what else to do with it so I gambled the lot.
GID00099335	Needless to say I won, then I won again, took my winnings to another casino and doubled the lot. I walked away with near sixty thou that day.
GID00099336	Carryin' around all those caps is just as bad as puttin' a target over your head out there though.
GID00099337	I hired a bodyguard to West Vegas and The Freetech Broadcast Station and brought myself the best home going.
GID00099338	I found it all down here, freedom, peace, friends, even a wife.
GID00099339	We took in the Kassberg's a few months ago after Kassberg Senior was taken from us by a damned Nightstalker ambush in Trapper's Pass.
GID00099340	OK, take it easy...
GID00099341	Excellent, you shall be well rewarded should you succeed.
GID00099342	I would try asking some of the residents...the vendors and Troopers have mostly lived here all their lives and I can vouch for them.
GID00099343	Here, take this key, it will give you access to the reactor so you can ask anyone working down there.
GID00099344	Be warned though, at the first sign of hostile activity towards us we will all turn on you, and even our citizens are trained and armed.
GID00099345	To a certain degree, yes, I'm head of the military here.
GID00099346	For decicions that affect the entire population we defer judgement to a panel of four.
GID00099347	They consist of myself, Santana, our Chief of Security, Vandereng, our head physician and Roach.
GID00099348	Try talking with McMillan or Cobb - they're out guarding the south and the east entrances respectively.
GID00099349	Also Roach may well have a number of things he needs doing.
GID00099350	Well, I'm glad you asked... It just so happens we have a spy in our midst.
GID00099351	Hayward has reported missing blueprints and Roach is down another two songs.
GID00099352	God help us if one of those bastards got in here and sabotaged the reactor...
GID00099353	Anyway, I need you to ask around with the residents and see if you can figure who it is.
GID00099354	Well..., I'm Colonel Hoff and I inherited my post as head of the military about ten years back.
GID00099355	I guess my story really begins long before that though, 27 years ago when I was still a Private in the Underground Military.
GID00099356	Back then The Underground was a peaceful place to live. All the sectors were clean and lived in and the citizens were happy and prosperous.
GID00099357	Then, one night, we were assaulted deep in the heart of our own Military HQ by a very well equipped force of Power Armoured troops.
GID00099358	They caught us by suprise and slaughtered many, siezing control of the HQ and our main armory in the process.
GID00099359	They executed The General and broadcast the whole thing through the PA system.
GID00099360	We fell back to the Power Plant and formed a defensive wall but they never came to attack, at least not directly.
GID00099361	Instead they have slowly built up thier own defenses and have spent time hiring scum from the outside, the damned 'Tech Raiders'...
GID00099362	Meanwhile our own Second In Command soon turned out to be a drug addled manic depressive. He topped himself eventually.
GID00099363	He was never the same after he lost his family during the 'Lurk invasion.
GID00099364	I was next in line but instead of reshuffling the ranks we decided to form the council of four in order to pool our ideas and resources.
GID00099365	Maybe one day we will find a new General.
GID00099366	Damn, I should have known. I never liked that guy.
GID00099367	Thank you for solving our problem. As for your reward you can have these combat supplies. I hope they serve you well.
GID00099368	Here, take this keycard too. It will allow you access to the Emergency Elevator in the Market Sector. Thanks again for your help.
GID00099369	Very well.
GID00099370	We're the smartest and toughest Super Mutant gang around... Or at least we were...
GID00099371	Not many of us left these days but we can still hold our own against those mindless knuckleheads in the Station.
GID00099372	Right now there's only six of us left. We used to number in the dozens. Then one day Caleb's boys walked in and decided they were in charge.
GID00099373	Some fought, some fled and some joined the other side. At the end we had Caleb cornered but we were massively outnumbered...
GID00099374	Eventually we had to agree to a truce else Scab and Klaus, Caleb's Generals, would have had us torn to pices.
GID00099375	Now we stick to our turf and they stick to theirs, unless they need something fixing that is..., I can't stand the bastards myself.
GID00099376	This is Headbanger turf. We own this area and live here.
GID00099377	Well I'm Koek, formerly a Corporal in the US Marine Corp. I'm one of the rare few who actually volunteered for the FEV process back in 2104...
GID00099378	I was on the wrong end of a mysterious chemical gas attack and they told me it was either that or face my internal organs slowly turn to mush.
GID00099379	One day after a scouting mission into the Midwest that lasted many years, my squad and I returned to find the Mariposa base in ruins.
GID00099380	Mariposa... That was where they made us... By that point it had become a place of nightmares rather than of hope and I was glad to see it go.
GID00099381	The whole operation was being overseen by some guy calling himself 'The Master'. I only saw him a couple of times...
GID00099382	He seemed to get increasingly power mad as time went on... No one was safe... I'm glad that bastard is rotting in Hell.
GID00099383	Once I saw the option to start a new life I grabbed it, as did many others like myself at the time.
GID00099384	Many years later a few of us stumbled across Spring Mount and it seemed an ideal place to start a new home.
GID00099385	There was a human who lived there at the time. I remember he had the whole place rigged to blow with explosives.
GID00099386	Luckily we managed to convince him we were friendly before we suffered any casualties. Alfie..., Crazy Alfie, that was what we called him...
GID00099387	Ex-Brotherhood if I remember right. I hope he got out of there... I heard Caleb's lot have resorted to eating humans again...
GID00099388	It was Caleb's mob who forced us to live in this shitty cave... Damn them, one of these days the Headbanger's will reclaim thier territory...
GID00099389	OK, watch yourself out there...
GID00099390	OK, thanks for stopping by again.
GID00099391	Any time, it's been a pleasure...
GID00099392	Well I'm a second generation US military bred Deathclaw and the oldest living member of my species that I know of...
GID00099393	My parents we're legends on the battlefield in thier time working as part of an organisation called 'Jackson's Chameleons'.
GID00099394	The military deemed that I was not considered combat ready on account of my chameleon abilites failed to manifest.
GID00099395	I spent most of my time up until the great war helping scientists and civilians with thier experiemnts.
GID00099396	After the war things quickly spiralled into chaos. I eventually found my way to a Vault filled with others like myself.
GID00099397	The leader Gruthar accepted me into his group and I soon found a kindred spirit in his son Goris, a scholar at the time.
GID00099398	I even met a mate, Yenny who refused my advances for many years before finaly relenting to me.
GID00099399	Eventually Goris left to explore the world alongside a human who, I must say reminds me a lot of you... Yenny and I left too too soon after.
GID00099400	Eventually we wound up here. I thought these tunnels were deserted but we happened upon a young Mr Cobb being picked on my a giant lakelurk.
GID00099401	He looked like he had taken a beating so I stepped in saved the day. The residents here have been very accomodating ever since.
GID00099402	About ten years ago now Yenny gave birth to our first and only son Damm.
GID00099403	Unfortunately I lost Yenny two years ago in Trapper's Pass. If only I had been there maybe I could have helped...
GID00099404	She was helping Cobb on a recon of the area when they were ambushed and overwhelmed by Power Armored raiders...
GID00099405	She killed many but they kept on coming relentlessly. Cobb's team were heavily outnumbered and had to fall back...
GID00099406	I will avenge her death one day...
GID00099407	Are you sure you want to hear my story... It's a long one.
GID00099408	Heh, well, some of us can... Although I have not met another like me in longer than I care to remember.
GID00099409	OK, it's been good talking to you...
GID00099410	Glad you're on board. Your targets are a 'Lurk we call Lockjaw, another huge ''Lurk we call The Megalurk...
GID00099411	...And two insane ghouls, Beckett and Gregor. Report back to me once they are dead and I'll make sure you are well rewarded.
GID00099412	That's great work, now we can start work on plans to reclaim our lost territory. Here take these as a reward...
GID00099413	No, you've done more than enough around here already. You can try asking around in the residential and market sectors.
GID00099414	I'm sure Roach in the broadcast tower would have some jobs for you too.
GID00099415	There's some spare rations on the medicine shelf. Help yourself to food and drink but leave the meds and ammo. We'll need those.
GID00099416	Nope, not around here...
GID00099417	I'm Phillipart and I guess I'm a master of all trades...
GID00099418	Around here I cook, brew spirits, help out around the workshops and deal with minor injuries.
GID00099419	I have a few supplies for sale if you are in need of food or medicine.
GID00099420	Yeah, sure, just let me know if you see anything you like...
GID00099421	OK, Bye.
GID00099422	Oh shit, I completely forgot about that. It must still be in my apartment. Here take the key.
GID00099423	It's the second single apartment on the top floor in the residential sector. The toolkit is next to my bed if I remember right...
GID00099424	I'm Reeves and I'm the head scientist here. I'm actually right in the middle of something at the moment so if you'll excuse me...
GID00099425	Right...
GID00099426	Yeah, Reeves wanted to take a look at them, he said maybe they could help with fine tuning the reactor's sub-system hardware.
GID00099427	You can usually find him down by the reactor.
GID00099428	No, not that I can think of... The Power Plant is the most monitored building in the Underground.
GID00099429	If anyone was up to something in here we'd spot them.
GID00099430	I'm Renzi and I'm the head of Robotics. I basically just keep the robots up and running.
GID00099431	I'm also proud to say I have over doubled the efficency of our own Sentry Bots in the last three years alone.
GID00099432	Though with these tools, when you know what you are doing, it's easy work so the hours are good.
GID00099433	OK, See ya.
GID00099434	Only whats down on the inventory... You can try talking to Hayward in the Broadcast Building.
GID00099435	He sometimes has some new modified weapons in stock. He knocks 'em up himself.
GID00099436	Take a look...
GID00099437	I guess it can't hurt to say, enough people know already..., I used to work for the Brotherhood of Steel.
GID00099438	I left not long before we lost HELIOS. That damn place was the end of us. On top of that I could not stand fighting the NCR...
GID00099439	They used to call me 'The Destroyer' in combat against mutants and raider scum.
GID00099440	It aint the same when you know the other guy from drinking down the local bar.
GID00099441	So me and a few buddies went AWOL and found refuge here in The Underground.
GID00099442	Not long after I was put in control of the armory because of experience with advanced weapons.
GID00099443	Unfortunately we only have access to the Public Armory. The Tech Raiders took over the military arsenal before I moved in.
GID00099444	Very well, goodbye.
GID00099445	I'm Chief of Security Santana. Basically I'm the one who keeps the troopers and officers in line when they party too hard.
GID00099446	As for my history I was born in The Underground and I'll die here.
GID00099447	Yeah, there is as a matter of fact..., Go talk to Colonel Hoff in the Power Plant. He believes we have a Tech Raider spy in our midst...
GID00099448	OK, behave yourself down here or you'll answer to me...
GID00099449	Ahh, need to increase cognative function eh... well, they're common enough.
GID00099450	Bring me five small black books, the ones with a blue spine... Then we have a deal.
GID00099451	Excellent, thank you and here in return are your pills.
GID00099452	Okay, which one were you thinking of?
GID00099453	Dammit, I'm not a drug dealer, have you been talking to Tecoult?... Actually nevermind about that.
GID00099454	As it goes I do happen to have access to a small amount of Concentr8 but if you want some youre gonna have to help me out first.
GID00099455	Some colours have been harder than others to find, in which case I will ask more of you in return.
GID00099456	Just let me know what type you are after.
GID00099457	With a face like yours I can see why... only kidding of course. Yeah, I have plenty of these.
GID00099458	Just grab me five small green pre-war books and we have a deal.
GID00099459	Excellent, thank you and here in return are your pills.
GID00099460	Yeah, you and me both. I'll be honest with you, I can't think of anything small enough for you to carry here in return.
GID00099461	Tell you what, just for you I'll give you my one-time no barter straight-up offer of 2500 caps per dose.
GID00099462	Excellent, thank you and here in return are your pills.
GID00099463	Need to kill something eh..., fair enough. These one's aint exactly rare but they are very popular around these parts.
GID00099464	Bring me back 10 small red sleeve books, the one's with gold trim and the pills are yours.
GID00099465	Excellent, thank you and here in return are your pills.
GID00099466	Have a look...
GID00099467	Well, since you ask my name is Schulze and I'm a collector and trader, anything else is none of your business.
GID00099468	I never figured you as the yellow type. I also never really figured out what these one's do but they are still pretty hard to come by.
GID00099469	I'll sell you those coz I don't really need 'em but I would be robbing myself if I charged you less than 500 caps per dose.
GID00099470	Excellent, thank you and here in return are your pills.
GID00099471	Sure, whatever.
GID00099472	Maybe I am, what's it to you anyway? You don't see me bothering anybody...
GID00099473	Awww what? That freaking ghoul? You have to be kidding, I love it here, it's... really ...good... why would I jepordise that?
GID00099474	He did did he... Well I don't know why he would say a thing like that. I keep to myself and stay out of other peoples buisiness. So should you.
GID00099475	Look, I don't know anything about no spy man... Why won't you just leave me alone...
GID00099476	Aww, fuck this, I'm sick of these hippy freaks anyway. Die motherfuckers...
GID00099477	Please, I don't know anything about a spy, just leave me alone.
GID00099478	Please, I dont know anything about a spy, just leave me alone.
GID00099479	Aww, fuck this, I'm sick of these hippy freaks anyway. Die motherfuckers...
GID00099480	Aww, fuck this, I'm sick of these hippy freaks anyway. Die motherfuckers...
GID00099481	Please, I dont know anything about a spy, just leave me alone...
GID00099482	Please, I dont know anything about a spy, just leave me alone...
GID00099483	Aww, fuck this, I'm sick of these hippy freaks anyway. Die motherfuckers...
GID00099484	No, just you pokin' your nose where it doesn't belong.
GID00099485	Well I'm Smorgan and I moved down here about three years ago now. Before that I was a travelling merchant.
GID00099486	My family and I we're trying to find a better home up North. We ended up getting ambushed by a gang of Tech Raiders.
GID00099487	They slaughtered everyone and left me for dead with a bullet in my shoulder... Somehow I managed to crawl to the Freetech Broadcast Tower.
GID00099488	The people here have done a good job of looking after me ever since.
GID00099489	OK, bye...
GID00099490	Nope, not in this place... all good people here...
GID00099491	Bah... who cares about the past..., it doesn't matter, what matters is today, and I'll drink to that.
GID00099492	Have a good one.
GID00099493	No, sorry, I can't get hold of that stuff. You can try with Shulze in the market...
GID00099494	I know he has some but I don't think he's selling.
GID00099495	Sorry, no. I wouldn't really know what to look out for. I still don't know everyone who lives here...
GID00099496	Yeah, Renzi needed it for some kind of robot optical unit. You should be able to find him in the Power Plant somewhere...
GID00099497	Nah, not around here friend... I keep a good eye on my own gear most of the time and no problems there either...
GID00099498	Ahh, looking for the spy eh? Glad to know someone is on the case...
GID00099499	I have been keeping an eye on the monitors and unfortunately I cannot report anything unusual.
GID00099500	I have been giving it some thought though. My guess is it would have to be someone who has not been around very long.
GID00099501	Not many fit that bill... Besides yourself there's Tyra, Smorgan and Hermsen, although none of them seem the type.
GID00099502	If you are going to investigate this matter further I'd recommend starting with them.
GID00099503	Basically I just watch the monitors, sometimes deal with brawls at the bar and generally try to maintain the peace around here.
GID00099504	OK, Bye.
GID00099505	Sure..., have a good day.
GID00099506	Yeah..., well there are a few things if you have the time.
GID00099507	Sure..., well around here we like to call it Freetech - it's made with technology and we have the freedom to do anything with it.
GID00099508	We make it on computers using a combination of custom software and hardware alongside regular and unique instruments.
GID00099509	For example we have several electric guitars lying around. You can get a suprisingly scary sound out of one of them if you know how...
GID00099510	Since before the war I have been a making music and from then up until now there are those who saught to destroy or steal it.
GID00099511	Not long ago I finally got wise and started installing tracking chips in all of my audiodiscs.
GID00099512	I have found a few of my missing discs are still in the local area. If you can I want you to find these discs and bring them back to me.
GID00099513	The areas seem to be defended but to an experienced adventurer like yourself I imagine the opposition will be a walkover.
GID00099514	So, what do you say, can you help me out? I promise I will reward you well.
GID00099515	Wow, really..., thanks. Here, I'll give you the locations.
GID00099516	Excellent..., yes, thats them all right, Hang on a sec while I make another copy. Thank you, here take these as a reward and take this key too.
GID00099517	The key will open the ammo boxes on the shelf. Hayward just knocked up some useful ammo types. They are now yours.
GID00099518	Excellent..., yes, they're mine all right, Hang on a sec while I make another copy. Thank you, here take these as a reward and take this key too.
GID00099519	The key will open the ammo boxes on the shelf. Hayward just knocked up some useful ammo types. They are now yours.
GID00099520	Yeah, there are a lot more discs where they came from. Not all tracker chipped unfortunately.
GID00099521	I know of three more but thier locations are heavily guarded. You still up for it?
GID00099522	Thanks for doing this, I'll make sure I have a special reward waiting on your return.
GID00099523	That's fantastic, thank you. I have not heard some of these in years.
GID00099524	As for your reward I hope this will proove as useful to you as it did to me in my adventuring days.
GID00099525	That's fantastic, thank you. I have not heard some of these in years.
GID00099526	As for your reward I hope this will proove as useful to you as it did to me in my adventuring days.
GID00099527	Sure, go ahead.
GID00099528	Not especially, I try to create for all moods but I have my favourite styles too I guess.
GID00099529	Also the loud and scary tracks have hidden bonuses like scaring away the mutated insects that live local. Especially the 'Lurks.
GID00099530	Well that's a very long story... over 240 years old if you know what I mean.
GID00099531	I'll tell you what, come back sometime after things are a bit calmer around here.
GID00099532	I'll crack open a couple of beers and tell you everything you want to know.
GID00099533	No, I get help from most of the people around here one way or another. Even Eddie has helped out on occasion.
GID00099534	Heh, you must be new around here. Well, I go by the name Roach and for the most part I'm a musician.
GID00099535	No worries, catch you again sometime...
GID00099536	Sorry but no, we're full up here but you can try with Riazanov at the Apartment Office across the street.
GID00099537	Here, have a look...
GID00099538	Well, since you ask, my name is Marra and I moved down here with a few friends about ten years ago.
GID00099539	As soon as we found out this place existed we had to come and check it out. I mean, what's not to like...
GID00099540	Constant partying, friendly atmosphere, loyal guards and back then there was a lot more room too.
GID00099541	A lot of people left after one of the main Reactors went critical a long way back. When we arrived everyone seemed happy to see a new face.
GID00099542	Now in my free time alongside looking after this place I make a good wage out of my own home made brand of cigarettes.
GID00099543	They're better than the real thing if you ask me.
GID00099544	Don't worry, it's nothing too difficult. I just need you to find my tool kit. It's not like normal tool boxes though.
GID00099545	It's a box of precision micro-tools for computer and optical tech. I loaned them out to Gieling, who loaned them to Wiltshire and so on.
GID00099546	Most people down here get so wasted they tend to forget stuff. I don't think anyone has stolen my tools. I trust most of the people around here.
GID00099547	I'm guessing that means they are around here somewhere just waiting to be found. So, think you can help me out?
GID00099548	That's great news. Try looking around the local apartments, maybe the school or the main block. I'm guessing it's not very far.
GID00099549	Look out for a small black box - I think it still has the Gun Runner's logo on it, like with custom gun parts. Thanks for helping out.
GID00099550	Well friend, my names Wiltshire and I'm the resident Underground DJ. I don't have to do much though. The computers take care of most of it.
GID00099551	Yeah, as a matter of fact I did, I guess you're the new owner then. Well, I'm glad someone is looking after the place.
GID00099552	To be honest most of that belonged to my dad, I was sad too see it go, I left a lot of memories there.
GID00099553	On the other hand I have found life here in the Underground so interesting and exiting that I don't have time to miss anything.
GID00099554	Well, apart from the non-stop parties, the unusual mix of people and the occasional hostile takover attempt it's actually quite chilled.
GID00099555	There is rarely any in-fighting here yet everyone is welcoming to outsiders such as yourself and I.
GID00099556	This can have it's problems, the Tech Raiders are constantly pestering the community with spies but they have yet to launch an organised offensive.
GID00099557	You would have to talk to one of the Trooper Officers to learn much more about them though.
GID00099558	Personally I am amazed by all the technology that has been hoarded down here. Also, despite my initial reaction I kinda love Roach's music too.
GID00099559	Roach..., Well he seems like a grumpy sort but underneath he is a very talkative follow and friendly enough when you get to know him.
GID00099560	You should go talk with him. I'm sure he would have a lot of things for you to do if you are interested. I know he would reward you well.
GID00099561	Well human, that's a long story and even I don't know most of it.
GID00099562	Well I kinda lost my memory, and what I do remember... well to be honest I think I'd rather just forget.
GID00099563	I took to wandering to find some answers but people were not very welcoming to say the least.
GID00099564	Eventually I found my way to the Freetech broadcast station and The Underground.
GID00099565	The people here seemed happy to have me around so I decided to stay. That's about all there is to tell.
GID00099566	My name is Sergeant McMillan and my job is to watch over this tunnel and look after my sqaud.
GID00099567	These days just ferals mostly. There's a local gang called The Skeleton Crew, occasionally they stir up the ferals into a frenzy....
GID00099568	They pump the big ferals full of jet, makes 'em move like lightning. They're still no match for me and my squad though.
GID00099569	Well they moved in about twenty years ago after Reactor B went critical flooding the local area with radiation.
GID00099570	They have been a constant nuisance ever since. They only got dangerous once the Skeleton Crew moved in and started to organise them.
GID00099571	They are a gang of ghouls that live in Ghost Town, it looks like they have joined up with our old enemy, the Tech Raiders.
GID00099572	They are very well armed but not as well armed as us. They have not been able to breach our defenses so far.
GID00099573	Well, long before the ghouls and the gangs came the 'Lurks. Many Underground Citizens had gone to work on the unfinished sectors.
GID00099574	During construction one of the bigger machines ended up parked over another cavern. The floor gave way and it fell through.
GID00099575	It ended up in a nest of Lakelurks. It turns out most of the unfinished sectors were surrounded by the things.
GID00099576	They started attacking in the hundreds. No-one was prepared. One of thier sonic blasts must have stuck the reactor.
GID00099577	Next thing you know the power plant is going into critical status and people are dropping like flies from the 'Lurks and the rads.
GID00099578	I was only a cadet at the time. I was lucky to escape. Major Cobb grabbed me and a few others to form a counter attack in the next sector.
GID00099579	The damn 'Lurks kept finding new ways in though and we had to fall back to where we are now
GID00099580	I don't know who they are or who is pulling thier strings but I can tell you this - they have access to some weapons that put our own to shame.
GID00099581	They seem to be obsessed by technology and Roach, our local radio legend, or his music at the very least.
GID00099582	I've lost count of how many newcomers turned out to be Tech Raider spies here to steal our possesions and secrets.
GID00099583	We don't see them much around this way though. The ferals wont tolerate them.
GID00099584	If you want to know more about them talk to Major Cobb. He is usually guarding the western end of the Market.
GID00099585	Well, since you ask, there are a few things you could help me out with.
GID00099586	The Easten Underground is infested with Ferals and 'Lurks but without co-ordination they are easy enough to dispatch.
GID00099587	If you could take out thier leaders, it would open the whole of the East up to be reclaimed.
GID00099588	So, what do you say, up for an assasanation run?
GID00099589	Yeah, there is as a matter of fact. There is a ghoul who goes by the name of Blaze. He enjoys burning people to death, including my friends.
GID00099590	Our orders are to stay here and guard this area but you look like you can handle yourself. You interested?
GID00099591	Fantastic. That bastards had this coming a long time. You'll probably find him around the old Ghost Town apartments.
GID00099592	He has a mob of armed ghouls around him so be careful. Take this key too so you can get in and out easily.
GID00099593	Well that's great news. Here, take these as a reward.
GID00099594	Here, have a look...
GID00099595	Well my names Tecoult and I supply the chems and the booze for our non-stop Freetech parties.
GID00099596	The stock aint free though, but it is the next best thing.
GID00099597	I keep the chems in the safe but you can checkout my inventory and see if I have anything you like.
GID00099598	Name's Frankie and I run this here Gun Shop. Now what can I do for you?
GID00099599	Wow, nice work, I'm impressed. Here's the key and a little extra to say thank you. Good luck down there. Even you'll need it.
GID00099600	Sure, here you go.
GID00099601	Well, there are a few things that spring to mind. I'll tell you what, I have a key that leads to a place called The Underground.
GID00099602	I used to live there..., for a while anyways. Used to be a great place... Now it's a damned hellhole but chances are it's still full of loot.
GID00099603	Personally I never feel the need to go back in there. There's critters in there meaner than anythin I seen out here.
GID00099604	If you can deal with a few local problems for me then the key is yours. You won't find another entrance south of Bonnie Springs.
GID00099605	Well, like I said The Underground is a very dangerous place...
GID00099606	If you want the key then you're gonna hafta proove to me you are tough enough to handle yourself down there.
GID00099607	OK. I happen to know the location of several huge mutants that have been wreaking havoc with the locals.
GID00099608	I'll start you off with a few Geckos though. That should be simple enough. Kill them and report back to me once the job is done.
GID00099609	Excellent, here, I'll upload the loactions to your Pip-Boy.
GID00099610	Nice work, those beasts have been wreaking havoc round here for months. You might just have what it takes after all.
GID00099611	Here, take these as a reward, you earned 'em. Now for the real challenge, if yer still up for it that is...
GID00099612	Well this one's gonna be a little more tricky. There is an old bunker south of here, used to be owned by the NCR.
GID00099613	Now the place is infested with giant radscorpions, the whole area is crawling with them.
GID00099614	Take out the big momma, I heard some NCR troops call her 'Bertha'. If you can manage that, I reckon you're just about ready.
GID00099615	No shame if you want to back out now. I'd understand.
GID00099616	Ok, here's the location. Good luck.
GID00099617	Wow, thats impressive, you must be pretty tough.... Y'know, I may just have something of interest to you.
GID00099618	A key, in fact, to the local Underground access. I won't lie, that place is a death trap but you look like you have a taste for adventure.
GID00099619	On the other hand you might just get yer head torn off. Tell you what, there's a giant radscorpion, goes by the name of Bertha.
GID00099620	She's been terrorising the NCR that patrol the area south from here for months now. Last I heard she had broken into one of their bunkers.
GID00099621	If you can kill her, then I guess that proves you are tough enough to handle The Underground. So, are yer interested?
GID00099622	Ok, I'll mark the location on your Pipboy. Good luck.
GID00099623	So Iv'e heard. Sounds like it was you who finally killed that bitch Bertha. You have my thanks for that.
GID00099624	In fact, I may have something that would be of interest to an adventurer like you. A key to the local Underground Access.
GID00099625	Though I must warn you that place is like hell on earth. If you're going in, I say be as prepared as possible and keep your wits about you.
GID00099626	Ok, here you go and good luck.
GID00099627	No problem, come here.
GID00099628	OK, if you're sure.
GID00099629	Sorry, this process still costs caps.
GID00099630	I guess I can spare a few things.
GID00099631	Sure, check out my inventory...
GID00099632	OK, check out my supply list...
GID00099633	Suit yourself. But you'll find out that your habit will cost you more than that in the end.
GID00099634	If that's what you think...
GID00099635	Well, good luck with that.
GID00099636	Okay. Hold still. I don't want to make this any more painful than it already is.
