GID00091103	Based on the other tanks in the room, you can safely assume this where your brain would be floating. It's currently missing from both the tank and its proper place in your head, but you seem to be doing just fine without it.

GID00091145	You've gotten a fragmented signal on your Pip-Boy - a coded transmission of some sort with a sad, jazzy undercurrent that makes your head hurt.

GID00091147	Heartless "Perk"
GID00091148	The scars on your chest seem to confirm what the Think Tank is saying... you cannot be poisoned, and filters in your artificial blood pump will regulate bleeding and healing, allowing all healing items (chems) to function at a higher level (+25%%).

GID00091184	No
GID00091185	You don't have enough caps to buy that item.
GID00091187	Cardiac Arrest "Perk"
GID00091188	Your heart is back in your body, but some advanced technologies remain: You are less resistant to poison (50%%) and robots are only somewhat confused by you (25%% less likely to score a critical hit) now. But on the bright side, healing items (chems) are twice as effective! (+50%%)
GID00091190	You can't use this while you're crouched.

GID00091227	No

GID00091237	Reinforced Spine "Perk"
GID00091238	Your spine is back in your body, but some advance technologies remain: Your torso can now be crippled again, but your Strength (STR) and Damage Threshold (DT) bonuses have doubled! (+2)
