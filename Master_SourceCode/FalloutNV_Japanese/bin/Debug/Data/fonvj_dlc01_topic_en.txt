GID00082819	I've found a way to do the bypass from here. You should be able to just use the terminal over there.
GID00082820	Know anything about this Gala Event we're supposed to trigger?
GID00082821	I need you to stay here and fire off the Gala Event.
GID00082822	Are you all right?
GID00082823	Don't act stupid. Let's get out of here.
GID00082824	This is where it ends, Dean, give up.
GID00082825	How did you get up there?
GID00082826	According to the marker, you're slated for a spot in Puesta del Sol.
GID00082827	If you think you can take me, come down and try it.
GID00082828	Do you know what happened to the others?
GID00082829	Casino security hit you like it hit me when you reached the lobby?
GID00082830	Yeah, lucky us. Love getting shot at by Pre-War ghosts.
GID00082831	Don't have time for the song and dance, Dean.
GID00082832	All the world's a stage. Soon your brains will be all over it.
GID00082833	So, what, you're going to risk blowing off your own head to kill me?
GID00082834	So, stabbing me in the back for the Sierra Madre?
GID00082835	How did you get from the Gala Event to here?
GID00082836	How did you get from the Gala Event to here?
GID00082837	Both Holograms are on now. It's safe for you to get to your position.
GID00082838	That's all I needed to know.
GID00082839	I had other questions.
GID00082840	All right. So find the other three people with bomb collars, bring them back here?
GID00082841	I need you to go down to the manual bypass room to regulate the power.
GID00082842	Why do you think he wants you to go the Puesta del Sol Switching Station?
GID00082843	Things would be a lot easier if you did one snap for yes, two snaps for no.
GID00082844	Do you know how to get out of here?
GID00082845	That Auto-Doc really carved you up.
GID00082846	Those facial scars weren't done by the Auto-Doc - the throat scar was.
GID00082847	How did you end up in the Auto-Doc?
GID00082848	Have other people shown up in search of the Sierra Madre?
GID00082849	Is anyone else alive around here?
GID00082850	I found one of your stashes. Why did you leave them around the Villa?
GID00082851	Before, you mentioned the Hologram at the Fountain - Vera? Do you know her?
GID00082852	Do you know what those machines around the Villa are?
GID00082853	This nodding, frowning, pointing you do is wearing me out.
GID00082854	Can't you communicate some other way? Can you write?
GID00082855	What weapons are you skilled at?
GID00082856	What are the Vending Machines all over town?
GID00082857	Tell me about the Cloud.
GID00082858	What can you tell me about the Villa and the town?
GID00082859	Wait here.
GID00082861	Collect Comps
GID00082862	Um... want gifts for good gamble?
GID00082863	100 Chips for 100 Pre-War bills.
GID00082864	Want, um, a hundred? Chips. Trade?
GID00082865	How about 500 Chips for 500 Pre-War Bills?
GID00082866	Want a lot of chips for a five hundredths bills.
GID00082870	Your voice... is that the Starlet's voice?
GID00082871	Now that your voice is back, what did you want to say?
GID00082872	The elevator to the vault is here, too.
GID00082873	How long have you been hunting him?
GID00082874	Sounds personal.
GID00082875	You sound like the woman in the Sierra Madre broadcast.
GID00082876	"Settle it?" You're here to kill him.
GID00082877	I don't have time for this. Get in the damn elevator.
GID00082878	Are you all right?
GID00082879	Who are you?
GID00082880	Looks like someone carved a roadmap across your face.
GID00082881	Did somebody cut your vocal cords?
GID00082882	Look, I'm here to help.
GID00082883	What happened?
GID00082884	This isn't what it looks like.
GID00082885	What's the matter?
GID00082886	If you attack me, you'll regret it.
GID00082887	Don't do that!
GID00082888	It's a bomb collar - mess with it, it'll go off.
GID00082889	Unless you want to lose your head, stop.
GID00082890	Let's just say we're in this together.
GID00082891	Enough of this shit, we need to move.
GID00082892	Look, we can have this not-talk later, let's go.
GID00082893	What do you mean by that?
GID00082894	We need to cooperate if we're going to get out of here.
GID00082895	If your collar goes off, mine goes off, it's better if we guard each other.
GID00082896	Look, together we can get out of this.
GID00082897	That's not going to work for me.
GID00082898	You're coming with me, or else.
GID00082899	I had questions I wanted to ask.
GID00082900	I had other questions.
GID00082901	Looks like someone set the bone saws to run random.
GID00082902	I don't understand why they shaved you bald.
GID00082903	Wait, the Auto-Doc didn't shave you bald?
GID00082904	No, wait, I want to hear this. You were bald before?
GID00082905	[BOS] You were a Brotherhood of Steel Scribe?
GID00082906	How the hell did you get out here?
GID00082907	Were you looking for something?
GID00082908	Were you researching something?
GID00082909	The Auto-Doc didn't do that?
GID00082910	So the Auto-Doc cut your voice box, not your scalp.
GID00082911	I can't restore your voice, we'd need a real Auto-Doc to do that.
GID00082912	So you cut your own hair off?
GID00082913	I... don't understand.
GID00082914	Wait... that's a Brotherhood of Steel symbol, right? You're a Scribe?
GID00082915	Where were you before?
GID00082916	I let you out of the Auto-Doc. I can put you back in there just as fast.
GID00082917	Glad we understand each other. Let's go.
GID00082918	Fine. Would hate to have carved you up anymore than you are.
GID00082919	Get going. I'll meet you at the Fountain in the center of the Villa.
GID00082920	Look, I'm not trying to order you. But your life is tied to mine.
GID00082921	What exactly is wrong? Don't you want out of here?
GID00082922	You're looking for something else. Fine, I can help.
GID00082923	Why don't you come with me, whatever else you're here for, not my concern.
GID00082925	He said he knew you.
GID00082926	He knew Elijah? How?
GID00082927	Sympathized? Why?
GID00082928	There's a chance he'll see reason.
GID00082937	What are you talking about?
GID00082938	Not one for sitting when the clock's ticking.
GID00082939	The chair's... an explosive? But...
GID00082940	Better be a shaped charge, or you're going to kill both of us.
GID00082941	Hnh?
GID00082943	Uh... you... probably want to hear my side of things.
GID00082944	I'll save my questions for the end - please, go on.
GID00082945	Look - I need your help to get into the Sierra Madre.
GID00082946	You've got my attention. For the moment.
GID00082947	I'm listening.
GID00082948	Misund...? Ummm.
GID00082949	I'll cooperate. What do you want?
GID00082950	I'm not going to help you.
GID00082951	Have you tried to deal with them?
GID00082952	Our collars... these "neckties" are linked. I die, you die.
GID00082953	Uh... look, maybe we can make some sort of... deal, you and me.
GID00082954	Your negotiation skills assume you're bargaining from a position of strength.
GID00082955	I think you're bluffing. I'm getting up, right now.
GID00082956	Either deal with me as an equal, or I walk.
GID00082957	Forget this, I'm leaving.
GID00082958	Agree to come with me now, or I get up from this chair and kill us both, shaped-charge or no.
GID00082959	I only need you breathing. Push me, I'll bring you to the point of death, then leave you.
GID00082960	It's starting to make sense, now that I've met you.
GID00082961	Meet at the Fountain, and we'll hear what the next step is.
GID00082962	How tough are they?
GID00082963	I'm not a bad shot. I could probably kill one.
GID00082964	I'm a fair shot. One shot, one kill is how I handle problems.
GID00082965	Where did they come from?
GID00082966	I think you can manage walking there without me. Now get going.
GID00082967	Fine. Get up and follow me.
GID00082968	Focus?
GID00082969	We'll find out more about our "contract" back at the Fountain.
GID00082970	Any reason you can't find your way there?
GID00082971	Fine. Get up and follow me.
GID00082972	Well, if I can get here, others will be, soon enough. Fountain's the safest place.
GID00082973	I had questions I wanted to ask.
GID00082974	I had other questions.
GID00082975	Is there anything else about them I should know?
GID00082976	I've never seen machines like those before.
GID00082977	Grifters?
GID00082978	How did he describe it?
GID00082979	What other items can you get out of the machines?
GID00082980	Where can I find these cards?
GID00082981	What do you mean?
GID00082982	Tell me. The short version.
GID00082983	Voice?
GID00082984	So you don't know the phrase?
GID00082985	All right, I'll head out and see what I can do on my end.
GID00082986	How so?
GID00082987	Forget the history lesson, get to the point.
GID00082988	Go on.
GID00082989	So what happened?
GID00082990	What was your problem with Sinclair?
GID00082991	But what did he do to you?
GID00082992	Forget Sinclair. If Vera was the key, she's dead.
GID00082993	I'm in. If that's all, let's head out.
GID00082994	So you're going to prove it now? How?
GID00082995	And if she is alive?
GID00082996	What do you mean?
GID00082997	I'm listening.
GID00082998	Fine. Meet at the Fountain?
GID00082999	Less painful would be me throwing you off the roof. Understand?
GID00083000	This thing on my neck isn't for show. That bomb goes off, so do I - and you, too.
GID00083001	I'm not going to let any harm come to you, all right?
GID00083002	<Lie> Dean, I wouldn't leave you here, I swear.
GID00083050	What happened to your voice?
GID00083051	That name carved on your chest... are you Dog?
GID00083052	Yes, this should be enough.
GID00083053	I haven't found enough yet.
GID00083054	Who locked you in that cage?
GID00083056	I want to know more about the Master.
GID00083057	I had questions for you.
GID00083058	All right, let's get out of here.
GID00083059	Meet me over at the Fountain, we'll plan our next move.
GID00083060	Who's this Old Man who brought us here?
GID00083061	I need you to get to your Gala Event position.
GID00083062	I had questions for you.
GID00083076	You've got a lot to answer for.
GID00083077	Still hiding behind images and screens, I see.
GID00083078	How did you access my Pip-Boy?
GID00083079	What do you mean?
GID00083080	You sure needed it to escape.
GID00083081	I wasn't the one hiding all this time.
GID00083119	I had to kill him before he hurt others.
GID00083120	He's trapped, no chance of him escaping.
GID00083121	He's dead.
GID00083122	There's something I wanted to pass along.
GID00083123	It's a message. The news is up to you.
GID00083124	Did it make any sense?
GID00083125	Here you go.
GID00083126	Yes. It was entrusted to me, not you.
GID00083127	Unlock it, give it back, then shut up.
GID00083128	I want to exchange Pre-War money for some Sierra Madre Chips.
GID00083129	Can we trade? Do you trade?
GID00083130	Can I turn in my Sierra Madre Chips for Pre-War Money?
GID00083131	I have shiny chips, want money - trade?
GID00083132	That's all for now. Thanks.
GID00083133	Don't need anything else. Bye.
GID00083134	Uh... 1 Chip for 1 Pre-War Bill.
GID00083135	Gimme one chip for one piece of paper.
GID00083136	Let me have 5 Chips for 5 Pre-War Bills.
GID00083137	Want five. Chips. For five dollars.
GID00083138	20 Chips for 20 Pre-War Bills.
GID00083139	Um, have 20 dollars... how many chips? 20?
GID00083140	I'd like help with something else.
GID00083141	Need help - can you help?
GID00083142	All right, let me see if I can find another way to do this without sending you down there.
GID00083143	<Lie> We'll take the elevator up, see if there's another way to do this. After you.
GID00083166	I know Elijah needs to be dealt with, just let me handle it.
GID00083167	You could have said something sooner.
GID00083168	Just die, tired of listening to you anyway.
GID00083169	What do you want to say?
GID00083170	Just glad you're safe. Hold up here, I'll take care of Elijah.
GID00083171	All right, come with me.
GID00083172	Meet me at the Fountain, then we'll go from there.
GID00083173	That's enough for now.
GID00083174	Let's get going.
GID00083182	That's our captor. He likes giving orders.
GID00083183	I dealt with the others, and I've got the key phrase.
GID00083184	I need you here, so sit tight.
GID00083185	This place... I'm not sure, it doesn't feel like a casino. Not entirely.
GID00083186	What? What is it?
GID00083187	Does that Auto-Doc there work?
GID00083188	Anything you can download off of it?
GID00083189	I had some questions I wanted to ask you.
GID00083190	Can the Auto-Doc heal your scars?
GID00083191	You said you got off lucky?
GID00083192	Elijah didn't put you in the Auto-Doc... Dean did.
GID00083193	I dealt with the other two in our team, now I need you to open something.
GID00083194	He wasn't trying to torture you, he needed to alter your voice to use an audio-lock.
GID00083195	That's the hologram projector in the Fountain. What of it?
GID00083196	You think he's using the Pip-Boy? To establish the projector connection?
GID00083197	How did you get to the main gate? Then get here?
GID00083198	Maybe it was a trust issue? He built this place for her, it feels like.
GID00083199	I have no idea, let's unlock it. The phrase is contained in the lyrics to a song.
GID00083200	I've got you to come down after me, it'll respond to your voice.
GID00083201	What does that mean?
GID00083202	If we stay here, the Cloud and the Holograms will answer that.
GID00083203	It's a decayed speaker. If we stay too long near one, it'll go off.
GID00083204	I believe he loved her, wanted to protect her. Too much.
GID00083205	Guess it's the object of someone's obsession - or affection.
GID00083206	What? What now?
GID00083207	The target's the vault, not the casino, right?
GID00083208	I found the phrase for elevator's audio lock.
GID00083209	Come on, we need to keep moving.
GID00083210	You'll have to wait just a little longer.
GID00083211	Are you going to be okay here?
GID00083212	<Take her hand.>
GID00083213	Not in a hand-holding mood right now.
GID00083214	All right, be ready.
GID00083215	I don't understand.
GID00083216	We'll get through this.
GID00083217	Yeah, "thumbs up" - you better appreciate it.
GID00083218	I'll be back for you, okay?
GID00083219	I mean it. Stay alive until I get back.
GID00083220	Get in that elevator or I'll make those scars on your face a pleasant memory.
GID00083221	What's wrong?
GID00083222	[Perception] It reminds you of being trapped in the Auto-Doc.
GID00083223	I have no idea what your problem is.
GID00083224	What the hell are you motioning about?
GID00083225	You ready? The sequence is: "Begin." "Again." "Let." "Go."
GID00083226	We'll see. I'll take care of him.
GID00083227	That's what I'm counting on.
GID00083228	He'll come here, to the Suites - when he does, let him go through.
GID00083229	Are... are you all right? Something seems off.
GID00083230	That's why you're waiting. You're going to kill him.
GID00083231	Do you trust me? If you do, let go of this.
GID00083232	If he kills you, I won't be able to get out.
GID00083233	Let him come through the suites, follow me. If he escapes, you'll still be here, waiting.
GID00083234	If you try and kill him, I can't let you do it. If you die, you'll kill us both.
GID00083235	Then I need to keep you from doing it.
GID00083236	Christine, please, let go of this. Let me deal with him.
GID00083237	He won't escape, I swear.
GID00083238	Fine. If you can't let him go, you don't leave me much choice.
GID00083239	Don't tell me where you're going - I'll find you after this.
GID00083240	For now, just say the words, and let's settle this so we can go home.
GID00083241	What? You can make the speakers stop or something?
GID00083242	You can dampen the signal somehow?
GID00083243	You... uh...speakers make a tempo... or...?
GID00083244	You can interfere with the Speaker's detonation frequency somehow?
GID00083245	Does that work with any other collar?
GID00083246	Got it, let's move on.
GID00083247	It's just your frequency.
GID00083248	...but only between us.
GID00083249	Yeah, speaker static makes our heads blow off, right.
GID00083250	You can interfere with the detonation signal from the speakers?
GID00083251	Great. How romantic.
GID00083252	We need to trigger the event like he says.
GID00083253	He leaves audio logs, too.
GID00083254	<Show her the Pip-Boy.>
GID00083255	No fucking way am I giving this to you.
GID00083256	What? What do you want?
GID00083257	I don't want you messing with this.
GID00083258	I had to get shot in the face for this. Get your own!
GID00083259	Careful, that's my arm, all right?
GID00083260	No worries, I'll just stand here like a piece of furniture until you're done.
GID00083261	<Wait.>
GID00083262	You sure seem eager to go.
GID00083263	I... can only type with two fingers?
GID00083264	Neither Dean or Dog have the technical aptitude to man the Switching Station?
GID00083265	I don't know what you're talking about.
GID00083266	I don't have any Sierra Madre Chips on me.
GID00083267	Think he might be close, then. Any idea where?
GID00083268	He'd have to be broadcasting from somewhere nearby.
GID00083269	You make a pretty lousy transmitter, you know.
GID00083270	Here's a Sierra Madre Chip. I'll need that back.
GID00083271	You want... a small circle?
GID00083272	We really don't have time for magic tricks right now.
GID00083273	You... can make more?
GID00083274	You can... scrounge more somehow.
GID00083275	I don't understand.
GID00083276	Yeah, there's more. All over.
GID00083277	I have no idea what you're talking about.
GID00083278	You can make more of those at a Workbench. With the right materials.
GID00083279	Maybe if I find whatever objects you're trying to describe, this might make more sense.
GID00083281	You need a battery... a Fission Battery... and Scrap Metal? And you can counterfeit the chips?
GID00083282	Can you teach me how to do it?
GID00083283	Maybe if I find what you're talking about, you can let me know.
GID00083284	You can use these somehow? To make... make Sierra Madre Chips?
GID00083285	What are you planning to do?
GID00083286	You've had your voice back for only a little while, and I'm already sick of listening to you.
GID00083287	If killing you will shut you up, let's do this.
GID00083288	Is that like a science thing?
GID00083289	You found a way to modify the collar's radio frequency.
GID00083290	But... your collar's still on. So you're not free.
GID00083291	You can modify the detonator signal. I don't see how that helps you.
GID00083292	What are you talking about?
GID00083293	Done talking? I want to put your little theory to the test.
GID00083294	There'll be a second or two of lag while you switch it. That's long enough for me to kill you.
GID00083295	You know I didn't put you in the Auto-Doc, right?
GID00083296	Even with the differences in the Villa, I don't want to fight.
GID00083297	We're inside the casino. We don't need to fight anymore, it's useless.
GID00083298	I didn't put you in that Auto-Doc. Dean did.
GID00083299	He wasn't trying to torture you, he needed to alter your voice to use an audio-lock.
GID00083300	Something to do with the surgery.
GID00083301	So... brain damage, or...?
GID00083302	Why... would someone remove your ability to write, or...
GID00083303	That's a specific form of brain surgery using electrodes. Pre-War.
GID00083304	That's a rather specific form of operation.
GID00083305	You can still do math, that's good to hear.
GID00083306	You can still do numbers and calculations.
GID00083307	You were knocked out?
GID00083308	He's broadcasting from the casino.
GID00083309	You really want to get to him, don't you.
GID00083310	Um, do you want to talk about it, or...?
GID00083311	No, before we go any further, I need to know what the problem is.
GID00083312	You kind of... changed there for a second.
GID00083313	Don't ignore me - your whole body language changed there.
GID00083314	Aren't you upset?
GID00083315	You're looking for the man inside the casino.
GID00083316	Elijah? You need to see Elijah.
GID00083317	Why are you looking for him?
GID00083318	You want to kill him.
GID00083319	He's responsible for the scars.
GID00083320	You mean business.
GID00083321	I'm fine with killing the son of a bitch. As long as we can torture him first.
GID00083322	Could always slap a collar on him and let him run into a wall of speakers.
GID00083323	I'd like to know why he did all this first and what's so important about the casino.
GID00083324	I'm not out to kill anyone, I just want to get out of here.
GID00083325	I don't care. I'd rather reason with someone first than simply kill them.
GID00083326	He came this way for a reason, and I want to know why.
GID00083327	Maybe you're right, killing him is the best option.
GID00083328	I just want to kill him anyway.
GID00083329	Did you get gassed like I did?
GID00083330	I didn't bring you here.
GID00083331	You think I had something to do with this?
GID00083332	Now... wait, you're acting like you don't trust me or something.
GID00083333	What? What about my feet?
GID00083334	Did you circle the area, or...?
GID00083335	I... don't understand.
GID00083336	You want to know how I got here?
GID00083337	Followed a radio signal here, a woman's voice.
GID00083338	None of your business.
GID00083339	<Raise an eyebrow back.>
GID00083340	...I was curious where it led.
GID00083341	Needed supplies, thought it might lead me somewhere interesting.
GID00083342	Thought I may have stumbled on an Old World treasure cache.
GID00083343	Looking to start life as a Prospector, figured this place was a good place to start.
GID00083344	I couldn't even tell you why, I just... did.
GID00083345	If I could leave, I would.
GID00083346	Me? What about you?
GID00083347	Are you saying it's one or the other?
GID00083348	What about you?
GID00083349	You're not going to leave.
GID00083350	I can't believe you'd want to stay here.
GID00083351	So once the collars are gone, we can just leave?
GID00083352	I... have no idea what you're saying. Again.
GID00083353	You're saying it'll be difficult to return here if we leave.
GID00083354	You were over the moon?
GID00083355	...to return here if I leave.
GID00083356	But not you.
GID00083357	Why can't you find your way back?
GID00083358	You aren't going to leave.
GID00083359	So you're after the treasure then?
GID00083360	Are you trying to break into the casino?
GID00083361	Why would you want to stay here of all places?
GID00083362	You were... looking for something?
GID00083363	You want to... hunt here?
GID00083364	You want to kill something here, then protect this place.
GID00083365	Why do you want to do that?
GID00083366	You're worried someone's going to find this place? Use it to hurt people.
GID00083367	You can't protect the world from the world... it's useless.
GID00083368	I'm not the one trying to communicate with hand motions.
GID00083369	Fine, be a bitch, then.
GID00083370	What are you shaking and nodding for?
GID00083371	Okay, okay, I get it. <Nod slowly.> Better than finger snaps.
GID00083372	You were looking for someone?
GID00083373	A smile... now that's more like it.
GID00083374	You really need to relax. This entire place is a Pre-War paradise, you know.
GID00083375	Look... we'll find a way to heal you, all right?
GID00083376	Wherever you were, it was hot out.
GID00083377	This charades shit is driving me crazy.
GID00083378	A robot?
GID00083379	Man?
GID00083380	Or a woman?
GID00083381	All right, someone alive.
GID00083382	An... angry, bearded... man.
GID00083383	You were looking for a man in a Vault.
GID00083384	You were looking for a Vault Boy?
GID00083385	The man on the Pip-Boy holotape, Elijah.
GID00083386	Someone smart.
GID00083387	...and nuts.
GID00083388	So why would you waste time looking for him?
GID00083389	Sounds like it's pretty important to you to find this person.
GID00083390	I don't understand.
GID00083391	He cut you off from someone.
GID00083392	Family? Husband?
GID00083393	Oh - girlfriend.
GID00083394	Uh... boyfriend?
GID00083395	What, your wife?
GID00083396	Oh - girlfriend.
GID00083397	Oh- girlfriend.
GID00083398	You were more than girlfriends - lovers.
GID00083399	Unrequited? Or...
GID00083400	What, you think I don't understand love?
GID00083401	Give me a little credit.
GID00083402	I understand how important a loved one can be.
GID00083403	Whatever, love is transitory - or ended in gunfire.
GID00083404	How did you get here from the Gala Event? And onto this floor?
GID00083405	Energy Weapons, Explosives, Melee, Unarmed, and Guns. Is that all?
GID00083406	You seem like you've been well-trained.
GID00083407	Oh, is that all? Guess that'll do.
GID00083408	So after your speech about control, now you're going to use the collars like Elijah did?
GID00083427	Are you going to give me the key or not?
GID00083428	Quit stalling, hand it over.
GID00083429	Come on, Dean, turning me to ash? Hardly the way to end a beautiful partnership.
GID00083430	Forget it, I'll just kill you and take it.
GID00083431	I found this Holotape in your safe.
GID00083432	That's all I wanted to know. Ready to die?
GID00083433	"Vera" Hologram? You know the holographic woman?
GID00083434	I bet I can figure out how to unlock the exit without you.
GID00083435	You're not a betting man, which means I'm betting you have the key to the exit on you.
GID00083436	No, based on your response, I'm sure of it.
GID00083437	Give me the key, Dean, and you walk.
GID00083438	I'm positive you have it. Now, I'll just kill you and take it.
GID00083439	I think she was sick, yes. Found a medical report in her Suite.
GID00083440	Why did you need her?
GID00083441	I'm not sure.
GID00083442	Are you really that stupid?
GID00083443	I'm not interested in killing you.
GID00083444	Has the Cloud decayed your brain? Forget the Sierra Madre!
GID00083445	That's the plan. Are you going to be able to do it safely?
GID00083446	I could just jab both wires into you, close the circuit that way.
GID00083447	If re-connecting the speakers is part of the Gala Event, yes.
GID00083448	Look, I need you to stay here and do it.
GID00083449	What weapons are you skilled with?
GID00083450	Sounds... interesting.
GID00083451	Any idea why he wants you there?
GID00083452	Security? What security?
GID00083453	Scrounge supplies? Like what?
GID00083454	How do you make it?
GID00083455	Always in the mood for another drink. What's the recipe?
GID00083456	What about Christine?
GID00083457	And the woman? The Auto-Doc victim - what about her?
GID00083458	Interesting? Interesting how?
GID00083459	Why... it sure is interesting. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
GID00083460	What happens during the Gala Event?
GID00083461	Can you tell me about her?
GID00083462	Introductions? You knew her before?
GID00083463	So you met her before she met Sinclair?
GID00083464	I found some medical records in the Villa Clinic. You brought her in for treatment, right?
GID00083465	So the visitors all killed each other?
GID00083466	What happened to the people who came to the Villa?
GID00083467	Any advice to getting through this?
GID00083468	The Gala Event's tied into the casino's generators?
GID00083469	How is the Gala tied to the casino? That makes no sense.
GID00083470	Why would security shut down for the Gala?
GID00083471	What do you mean about the Sierra Madre broadcast?
GID00083472	So... it's not an invitation, it's a call for help.
GID00083473	The bombs fell, and the emergency signal went out.
GID00083474	She's been broadcasting all this time?
GID00083475	I'm not following you.
GID00083476	Wait, what Holograms? What are you talking about?
GID00083477	I didn't see any security coming in - only the speakers.
GID00083478	So how do I get you out of there?
GID00083479	All right, I'll head for the door on the left.
GID00083480	All right, I'll break to my right, head for the locked door.
GID00083481	Uh... anything else you can tell me that'd help? Anything?
GID00083482	I need a little more than that to go on if we're going to break out of here.
GID00083483	This casino's security system is pissing me off.
GID00083484	What about the speakers in here?
GID00083485	Dean, the theater speakers are wired to a central sound system, right?
GID00083486	Calm down, think. Do you know specifically where?
GID00083487	One problem at a time. Take a breath, try and remember.
GID00083488	Yeah, but if I run, what about the Security Holograms?
GID00083489	Getting backstage is a temporary measure if I can't find the security terminal.
GID00083490	Good thing you mentioned that before I ran back there, "partner."
GID00083491	That's the radios and speakers - what about a central sound system?
GID00083492	Keep going. What else?
GID00083493	Is there one console that runs them or several?
GID00083494	All right, makes sense. Where's the music?
GID00083495	So I go to the locked door, right?
GID00083496	Wait - I need to head to the door to your left or my left?
GID00083497	What are you doing with a key to her room?
GID00083498	The key is a song by Vera Keyes.
GID00083499	Fine with me. Come on, let's settle this.
GID00083500	As long as I re-establish a frequency to each floor, I can rebuild the song.
GID00083501	The song still exists in fragments in the Sierra Madre archives on each floor.
GID00083502	What about the collars, huh? Kill me, and...
GID00083503	And the collars? You sound awfully eager to kill someone whose life is tied to yours.
GID00083504	<Lie> I'm not sure how to do it yet. You said you had a recording outside?
GID00083505	The one who put these collars on us wanted me to deal with everyone first.
GID00083506	Wait - you said you have one inside? Where's the song recording you have?
GID00083507	Christine is alive. Dog... well...
GID00083508	Christine is dead. Dog... well...
GID00083509	<Lie> If by "recording inside" you meant Christine, she's dead.
GID00083510	If by "recording inside," you meant Christine, she's dead.
GID00083511	The one who put these collars on us wanted me to deal with everyone first.
GID00083512	No - believe it or not, I wasn't going to leave you to die.
GID00083513	If it means I can get out of this alive, yes, that's why I'm here.
GID00083514	Yes, that's the next step. You going to be all right?
GID00083515	Now that I've got the signal established to this floor, yes.
GID00083516	The terminal can tie the fragments together, just need to wrap it up.
GID00083518	Wait, you were trying to smuggle one inside? Where is it?
GID00083519	If you were using Christine's voice box to smuggle Vera's voice in, she's dead.
GID00083520	<Lie> If Christine's throat surgery was your plan, too late, she's dead.
GID00083521	Christine is alive. Dog... well...
GID00083522	Christine is dead. Dog... well...
GID00083523	Still trying to find out. Not sure.
GID00083524	Everyone's still alive on each floor - including you.
GID00083525	I found this Holotape in your safe.
GID00083526	Were you blackmailing Vera Keyes to break into the Sierra Madre?
GID00083527	What did you want her to do?
GID00083528	What were you blackmailing her with?
GID00083529	That's all I wanted to know. I'll head out, see what I can do on my end.
GID00083530	Really? What makes you think you can slip out?
GID00083531	I guess I should have figured you'd have an escape plan. Clever.
GID00083532	I'm that predictable, am I? You're probably right.
GID00083533	...head backstage, destroy every speaker, grab every key, then shut down security...
GID00083534	So as long as I make sure I don't run for the exit...
GID00083535	...that plan sounds pretty clear to me. Got it.
GID00083536	Really? You're a terrible liar. See you soon, Dean.
GID00083537	We'll talk about this more when we're face-to-face.
GID00083538	I guess I'll try the key and see.
GID00083539	I can handle a 200 year old washed-out lounge singer, trust me.
GID00083540	If I clear out all the Ghost People in the area, will you change your mind?
GID00083541	All right. What's it going to take?
GID00083542	What if I can guarantee they won't come into the courtyard below?
GID00083543	The Villa has Holograms everywhere. If I switch on some to cover the area...
GID00083544	I could just throw you off the roof. What about that?
GID00083545	Let me hunt around, maybe there's something I can do to protect the area.
GID00083546	I switched on two Holograms to cover the courtyard, those should protect you.
GID00083547	Okay, let me see if I can reactivate the Holograms.
GID00083548	I don't need to kill you, you know.
GID00083549	Both of us dying wasn't my plan.
GID00083550	I could break both your legs, leave you here on the roof.
GID00083551	All I need is your hands to hold the wires.
GID00083552	No, it only means I wouldn't come back for you. Ever.
GID00083553	If I break your legs, you can't leave - only scream. Here, in the middle of town.
GID00083554	Do what I say, or I'll break both your legs and leave you here.
GID00083555	If you don't do this, I'll go shut off the Holograms now.
GID00083556	Dean... a man with cold feet isn't someone I'd share a bed with.
GID00083557	Look, what do you want to do this?
GID00083558	I'm not about to trade your life for mine, got it? Remember the collars.
GID00083559	Just trust me, all right?
GID00083560	Don't trust me? Then trust our collars. I die, you die. Got it?
GID00083561	I think you can count on the Holograms, okay?
GID00083562	Vera's stayed powered up since the bombs fell... those Holograms will, too.
GID00083563	You must know me enough by now to know I'm not going to put you in danger.
GID00083564	There's a Hologram guarding the courtyard below, you're covered.
GID00083565	These Ghost People... they're the only ones alive around here?
GID00083576	So... you're locked in there? Where's the key?
GID00083577	You wouldn't have locked yourself in there without some sort of key to let you out.
GID00083578	Did you hit your head or something? You're acting odd.
GID00083579	You have multiple personality disorder. Some trauma caused this?
GID00083580	I heard electricity and radios can cause, uh, voices in people's heads.
GID00083581	In Super Mutants, brain damage is usually the result of prolonged Stealth Boy usage.
GID00083582	We need to get you to the Gala Event. Get you to your place.
GID00083584	What are you, exactly? You're acting different than before.
GID00083585	Have orders for you - for going, staying, all that.
GID00083586	Come on, then. I won't make it easy on you.
GID00083587	I don't plan on running, it's time to kill you both.
GID00083588	Dog... listen to me... don't do this.
GID00083589	Dog! Stay! If you don't, Master will be mad!
GID00083590	No, hold it tightly by the neck - now sink your teeth into it, tear it apart.
GID00083591	Dog, hidden on you is the key. Find it, and toss it to me.
GID00083592	I need your obedience. First, I'm going to show you a trick.
GID00083593	Now that you are awake, Master wants you to listen, Dog.
GID00083594	Just give me the key - you want out of the cage, don't you?
GID00083595	Aren't you hungry? Go on - feed, piece by piece.
GID00083596	Shut up, reject, and give me the key. Now.
GID00083597	Yes, well, it had to be done. Now, I need you to remain here.
GID00083598	I have some unfinished business. Are you going to be all right?
GID00083599	Fine. Let's go, follow me.
GID00083600	Go to the Fountain and wait for me there.
GID00083601	Master needs you to pull on the chain on your neck as hard as you can.
GID00083602	What weapons are you good at?
GID00083603	Dog, do you know why you have to go to the position on the map?
GID00083604	Do you know how the Ghost People taste?
GID00083605	So Master vanished around that time.
GID00083606	If the casino already opened, what are we doing here?
GID00083607	I can't do it - fighting's more merciful than this.
GID00083608	Do you know how long ago?
GID00083609	I watched you devour one of the Ghost People.
GID00083610	Doesn't that make the voice mad?
GID00083611	Why do you eat the Ghost People?
GID00083612	Can you tell me more about the Gala Event going off?
GID00083613	Can you tell me about the other voice inside you?
GID00083614	Did you bring me here?
GID00083615	Do you know the way back?
GID00083616	Forget this. Come on, let's fight, you big reject.
GID00083617	Ready for more? Come on, let's finish this.
GID00083618	Dog... stay back, listen to me.
GID00083619	Dog! Stop! Or Master will be mad!
GID00083620	No, look, I wasn't the one who caged you here, all right?
GID00083621	Dog, the Master sent me. He commands you to listen to my voice now.
GID00083622	Good... well done, Dog. I'm pleased. Now stay.
GID00083623	Dog, listen to the other voice inside now. Go to sleep, let him come out.
GID00083624	The other voice? See it in your head - not as a voice, but as a ball, the size of your hand.
GID00083625	You're not leaving me any choice, I have to stop you.
GID00083626	Take that chain around your neck, grab the ends, and pull slow and hard until you hear a crack.
GID00083628	Dog, if you do this, you'll kill yourself.
GID00083629	If you try to burn the voice out of you, this casino will be destroyed, and us along with it.
GID00083630	There's no need for any of that, let's get out of here.
GID00083631	Close your eyes, and only open them if the voice tells you.
GID00083632	Reach around to the chain on your neck, see if you can find a key.
GID00083633	Dog, do you know why you have to go to the position on this map?
GID00083634	This is important - do you remember what happened exactly?
GID00083635	Goodnight, Dog. You won't wake up, ever again.
GID00083636	Um... do you want to talk about it?
GID00083637	Dog, think back to the lights, the pretty ones.
GID00083638	Wait, the casino already opened?
GID00083639	Could I find my way back?
GID00083640	The Master sounds like he treats you well.
GID00083641	That's it, sleep, reject. Sleep like the dead.
GID00083642	Try to picture the voice, inside, and, uh, turn in and look at it.
GID00083643	Imagine the voice, not as a voice... but as water. Look at the voice now, what do you see?
GID00083644	Then... step into the water, step into yourself.
GID00083645	Do you know what happens if you go into the water, Dog?
GID00083646	Now that you see, I want you to step back, listen to the voice again.
GID00083647	Fine, reject. You want to die? I'll accomodate you.
GID00083648	Dog, that voice doesn't control you, all right?
GID00083649	Do you need to eat them to make them stay down?
GID00083650	Bite down on it, chew until it's silent, then swallow it.
GID00083651	Forget it. I'm sick of dragging you around anyway.
GID00083652	I don't mean you any harm... you just need to calm down, focus.
GID00083653	When we were sneaking, you mentioned Lou... who's Lou?
GID00083654	That all seems lethal. Sort of.
GID00083655	So... dismemberment and disintegrations take them down.
GID00083656	Look, listen to my voice, maybe... maybe I can help.
GID00083657	Dog, I stopped because I don't want to hurt you - now listen. I want to help.
GID00083658	Maybe you just... uh... need to hear another voice, like mine.
GID00083659	Dog, Master is here now, Master wants you to stop this.
GID00083660	How do you do it?
GID00083661	Can you show me where?
GID00083662	Dog... just calm down... there's no need to keep fighting.
GID00083663	Is that why you have a bear trap locked on your arm?
GID00083664	Can you tell me how you got to the Sierra Madre?
GID00083665	How you get here?
GID00083666	Those scars on your body - where did you get them?
GID00083667	I need you to stay here and trigger the switches.
GID00083668	That's enough for now.
GID00083669	Your name is carved on your chest. Is that part of it?
GID00083670	Can you tell me about the voice?
GID00083671	I had other questions for you.
GID00083672	Me hear voice, too? Then got here, bad place.
GID00083673	Don't like it here, either.
GID00083674	Voice in the air?
GID00083675	What do you eat?
GID00083676	Nuh-uh!
GID00083677	Why you want to look like ground?
GID00083678	Must been hard to see you.
GID00083679	Maybe you go back someday.
GID00083680	Where Church now?
GID00083681	Sound nice. It still there?
GID00083682	Where does the voice come from?
GID00083683	Sounds like good trade.
GID00083684	I want to hear more about the Master.
GID00083685	Where's your collar?
GID00083686	What's the other voice?
GID00083687	Do you know how to wake him up?
GID00083688	If you have the key in there, the "Old Man" can order Dog to open the cage.
GID00083689	What weapons are you good at?
GID00083690	So you're the one who knows how I got to the Villa.
GID00083691	Sounds like Dog might be more willing to get out of the cage than you.
GID00083692	I need you to stay and operate the switches for the Gala Event.
GID00083693	I bet I can get Dog to stay here, if you won't.
GID00083694	What do you know about the Gala Event?
GID00083695	Are you going to be all right?
GID00083696	Now, if you've got him on a leash, I need to finish things here.
GID00083697	As long as you're not planning to blow up the casino now, great.
GID00083698	Not having your help doesn't matter if this heals you.
GID00083699	I don't want you to be under anyone's control, even mine.
GID00083700	Then I don't want you to merge, I need you here... Dog, listen to my voice. Dog?
GID00083701	We came this far, I'll manage. Go on, let go.
GID00083702	I promise I'll try not to get killed.
GID00083703	Just go before I change my mind.
GID00083704	Dog?
GID00083705	Are you all right?
GID00083706	Your voice... it's different.
GID00083707	It'd take too long to explain.
GID00083708	A cage... but at least you're not in two of them now.
GID00083709	We're trapped inside a casino in a poisonous city.
GID00083710	Go on and rest. I have to take care of something.
GID00083711	If you get the strength to leave, do so - quickly.
GID00083712	Fine, don't take too long, or it'll be a short recovery, trust me.
GID00083713	Dog... don't do this, listen to me, my voice.
GID00083714	Dog, Master is here now, Master wants you to stop this.
GID00083715	Yeah, well, I'll make Dog help me. Can't be hard to figure all this wire stuff out.
GID00083716	If that diagram over there holds the details, I can walk Dog through the instructions.
GID00083717	If I bring food, will that calm Dog down?
GID00083718	<Lie> Just... stay here in the courtyard, I'll go get food.
GID00083719	I had other questions for you.
GID00083720	Do you know anything else?
GID00083721	How do you switch back and forth between voices?
GID00083722	We need to discuss tactics - and positioning.
GID00083723	I was looking for someone with a collar like mine. Where is your collar?
GID00083724	Why did you lock yourself in the cage?
GID00083725	I need to get you out of there.
GID00083726	If you weren't expecting me, who were you waiting for?
GID00083727	If that collar inside you is active, I didn't switch it on.
GID00083728	How the hell did you... or whoever... eat one of these collars?
GID00083729	Maybe you shouldn't go around shoving Old World tech in your stomach.
GID00083730	Forget it. I had other questions.
GID00083731	Do you know how I got here?
GID00083732	Why do you say I'm the same as the Old Man?
GID00083733	This Old Man, what do you know about him?
GID00083734	You brought me here to the Villa.
GID00083735	I can't leave until we get through this.
GID00083736	So you know the way back?
GID00083737	Why do you say that?
GID00083738	I don't remember, only woke up when my Pip-Boy went active.
GID00083739	No idea, I was unconscious the whole time.
GID00083740	So Dog could just open the door at any time?
GID00083741	Scorched by the sun?
GID00083742	What is he doing here?
GID00083743	So why did you bring me here?
GID00083744	If you locked him... you... in, what if you couldn't get out?
GID00083745	Wait. So you... or Dog... doesn't know the key is on him?
GID00083746	Something tells me I could walk Dog through unlocking a door.
GID00083747	Why did you surround yourself with all these radios?
GID00083748	These radios, were you using them for signal interference?
GID00083749	If you don't come with me, he'll set off our collars - yours and mine.
GID00083750	I could order Dog to come with me. I bet he'd obey.
GID00083751	The key's in there with you - and Dog.
GID00083752	I could just tell Dog he has the key.
GID00083753	If I can't prove it to you, then forget this, I'm bringing Dog out.
GID00083754	<Play Elijah Audio Tape.>
GID00083755	Do you want to die? Cooperate, or you're both dead.
GID00083756	If he hears the Old Man's voice, he'll do what the Old Man says.
GID00083757	I can play his voice, yes. I have an audio log from him on my Pip-Boy.
GID00083758	The Old Man's voice is on my Pip-Boy, just like yours.
GID00083759	I want my freedom, too. You think I like having this collar on me?
GID00083760	What if we go after the Old Man together?
GID00083761	Goodbye, whoever you are... I'm going to let Dog out of his cage.
GID00083762	Calm down. Follow me, willingly, I won't do it.
GID00083763	I have the power to let Dog out of his cage. I'm going to prove it by not doing it.
GID00083764	I guess... the alarm outside sure is a racket, though.
GID00083765	You're blocking the eavesdropping with the alarm outside, too. Nice.
GID00083766	I can't convince you I'm not here for the Sierra Madre or the Old Man, so I'll prove it.
GID00083767	So the Gala Event was triggered at least once?
GID00083768	Even if Dog is more helpful, we can manage.
GID00083769	In that case, I will bring him along, I don't need you.
GID00083770	What do you mean?
GID00083771	Surprised they could hear you over the alarm bell outside.
GID00083772	...and the alarm sound outside helps as well. Your doing?
GID00083773	Why does that make him go away?
GID00083774	Well... true enough. Sure uses the word "Master" a lot.
GID00083775	Why did you put emphasis on the word "Master" before?
GID00083776	Sounds like it makes you mad.
GID00083777	What does Elijah make Dog do that angers you so much?
GID00083778	Can't you do anything?
GID00083779	Does not being in control bother you so much?
GID00083780	You're trying to protect Dog. Having Elijah control him, hurt him - you want to protect him.
GID00083781	You care about him.
GID00083782	Why can't you control him?
GID00083783	Did getting hit in the head cause you to start acting this way?
GID00083784	You have multiple personality disorder. Some trauma caused this?
GID00083785	Where is your collar?
GID00083786	I want to know more about the man who brought us here.
GID00083787	What's Elijah doing here?
GID00083788	What does Dog know?
GID00083789	Dog said he triggered the Gala Event once already.
GID00083790	Something about lights and colors, not much else.
GID00083791	He said the casino opened up.
GID00083792	If the casino opened up, then why are we here?
GID00083793	If he got trapped, why didn't he set off the collars?
GID00083794	Couldn't he have commanded you to rescue him?
GID00083795	Does the casino block the signal?
GID00083796	So what happened then?
GID00083797	What are you talking about?
GID00083798	Then how are the collars active again?
GID00083799	The Pip-Boy could boost the signal. If Elijah has a Pip-Boy, that would explain it.
GID00083800	He can't have possibly have set up a deadman's switch like that.
GID00083801	If you won't do it, then Dog will, like he did at the police station.
GID00083802	Any reason why you're assigned to this point on the map?
GID00083803	I heard electricity and radios can cause, uh, voices in people's heads.
GID00083804	In Super Mutants, brain damage is usually the result of prolonged Stealth Boy usage.
GID00083805	Do you know how to operate the switches?
GID00083806	Worried about being attacked if left here? The gate looks strong enough.
GID00083807	I need you to trust me. I let you out of the cage in the Police Station.
GID00083808	What kind of food should I bring back?
GID00083809	You need to trust me if we're going to get through this.
GID00083810	<Lie> I'll go hunt for food, you just stay here, and wait.
GID00083811	I expect you to do what you're told.
GID00083812	All right, I'll go hunting, see what I can find.
GID00083813	So some of the "meat" inside them?
GID00083814	We don't really have time for this.
GID00083815	I'm not about to fight any more Ghost People just to feed you... or Dog.
GID00083816	If you know how to operate the switches, I need you to trust me to get through this.
GID00083817	Yeah, well, I'll make Dog help me. Can't be hard to figure all this wire stuff out.
GID00083818	If that diagram over there holds the details, I can walk Dog through the instructions.
GID00083819	I don't want Dog to have to deal with this, I prefer to deal with you.
GID00083820	Because this requires intelligence, and I trust you to do this.
GID00083821	I need someone who can operate the switches - and stay in control.
GID00083822	If that's what it takes to make you listen, yes.
GID00083823	I can't trust Dog to do this properly. I can trust you.
GID00083824	Sounds to me if I bring Ghost People here, you couldn't handle them.
GID00083825	If you don't stay here, I'll bring Dog out and leave him here.
GID00083855	What are these Holograms?
GID00083856	Why?
GID00083857	"Security" doesn't sound safe to me.
GID00083858	How are they different?
GID00083859	Who are you?
GID00083860	How are you speaking to me?
GID00083861	Who are these people I'm gathering?
GID00083862	Can you tell me about the Holograms in the Villa?
GID00083863	What is the Cloud?
GID00083864	What are the Vending Machines in the Villa?
GID00083865	How am I supposed to get to the markers on my map?
GID00083866	What is the Gala Event?
GID00083867	What's inside the Sierra Madre?
GID00083868	Aside from switching them off, what can I do?
GID00083869	If I can't punch them or smash them, that doesn't leave me many options.
GID00083870	Who's the woman Hologram in the Fountain?
GID00083871	How did I get here?
GID00083872	I had questions.
GID00083873	Never mind, then.
GID00083874	I've decided I'm not going to help you.
GID00083875	We'll head out, then.
GID00083876	The real work? What was this, a warm-up?
GID00083877	What do you mean?
GID00083878	Collar? What are you talking about?
GID00083879	What do you want?
GID00083880	I'm not going to help you.
GID00083881	No, I'm not helping you.
GID00083882	Is there any place safe to rest?
GID00083883	What is this place?
GID00083884	How did I get here?
GID00083885	Is there anyone alive around here?
GID00083886	Why is my vision blurring?
GID00083887	Where is my gear?
GID00083888	Will exposure kill me?
GID00083889	Radios and speakers?
GID00083890	How did you get me here again?
GID00083891	What do you need me to do now?
GID00083892	Radios and speakers can set off my collar?
GID00083893	Where can I find him?
GID00083894	The inhabitants? There's people alive here?
GID00083895	What Holograms are you talking about?
GID00083896	So how do I destroy the radios and speakers then?
GID00083897	How am I supposed to find them?
GID00083898	So I need others to pull off this... heist. Who?
GID00083899	Any suggestions for who I should get first?
GID00083900	What's FEV?
GID00083901	Why would you do that?
GID00083902	I'll help. What do you want me to do?
GID00083903	Are they all dead?
GID00083904	How many of these victims did you bring here?
GID00083905	Where is my gear?
GID00083906	What do you mean?
GID00083907	What is this rifle?
GID00083908	You've caught others?
GID00083909	I'm not alone, then.
GID00083910	Then maybe you better tell me why I'm here.
GID00083911	I'll cooperate - if you can answer some questions for me.
GID00083912	Forget it, then. I'll be on my way.
GID00083913	So I have to deal with them - or I explode?
GID00083914	You have got to be kidding. This place is filled with radio mines that can kill me?
GID00083915	Where did you get the collars?
GID00083916	If they're Pre-War tech, where did you get them?
GID00083917	I've never heard of the place you're talking about.
GID00083918	What do you want from the Sierra Madre?
GID00083919	I don't understand how an Old World casino helps you do any of that.
GID00083920	Properly? Are you kidding me?
GID00083921	Working as murderous deathtraps, sure.
GID00083922	If you secure that, that's all you want?
GID00083923	You're Veronica's mentor. The Elder who lost HELIOS One.
GID00083924	I can't argue that.
GID00083925	What would you use them for?
GID00083926	You want to attack NCR? All of NCR?
GID00083927	[NCR] If you want to kill NCR, that's fine with me.
GID00083928	I don't care about the Republic, they're yours to kill.
GID00083929	Then we better get to killing them.
GID00083930	How did you find out about the Sierra Madre?
GID00083931	You're nothing more than a killer that aspires to mass murder.
GID00083932	What are you talking about?
GID00083933	So you answered madness with madness?
GID00083934	What happened?
GID00083935	I'm sick of talking to some image on a screen. If you're going to come down, do it.
GID00083936	Now that I'm here, are you coming down?
GID00083937	How did you get me here?
GID00083938	So someone else with a collar placed one on me? Who?
GID00083939	If Dog put a collar on me, why didn't he say so?
GID00083940	What happened to my gear?
GID00083941	Do you know how to get out of here?
GID00083942	So the casino stripped me of my gear?
GID00083943	I don't believe you.
GID00083944	Unless you come down here, I'll destroy the vault, everything in it.
GID00083945	I'm not interested in the vault, I only want to leave.
GID00083946	Then I'll find a way to unlock the secrets of this vault, take them for myself.
GID00083947	I... I'm pretty sure I can do some damage down here. Somehow.
GID00083948	We'll see how "protected" the Vault is when I detonate this collar.
GID00083949	Sounds like I'm dead anyway, the way you're talking.
GID00083950	Denying you the Sierra Madre vault would be worth it.
GID00083951	Oh, so you're willing to risk it?
GID00083952	You... you don't have any way to transmit down here.
GID00083953	Between floors? I don't think so.
GID00083954	I'll trash the electronics, the vault wiring, maybe.
GID00083955	Forget the Vault. The elevator's only a single control box.
GID00083956	Wait until I get my hands on the computers, we'll see.
GID00083957	All it takes is destroying a single terminal or holotape.
GID00083958	Maybe too many safeguards, as you've discovered already.
GID00083959	Destroying even a single fragment of data is more than you could stand.
GID00083960	Safeguards? If you're a gambling man now, stay up in the casino.
GID00083961	Um... are you sure of the frequency?
GID00083962	There's noticeable lag of several seconds for the collar to go off - and a warning.
GID00083963	Well... then you'd need some way of transmitting that, right?
GID00083964	I'll clip the wires to this intercom, then the Pip-Boy.
GID00083965	If that's what it takes to fix this, that's fine with me.
GID00083966	Throwing a wrench into the works is what I do best.
GID00083967	Having you wait up there forever with no way down sounds more appealing all the time.
GID00083968	What can I say to convince you I just want to go?
GID00083969	You've already waited too long for this moment, there's no need to wait any longer.
GID00083970	Look, let me out, you get in the vault, we're both happy.
GID00083971	You followed the signal, too. You want what's down here, I want out. Let's deal.
GID00083972	You're right, it will be different - has been different.
GID00083973	Both of us working together has allowed us to get this far.
GID00083974	I've cooperated so far. You've made sure of that.
GID00083975	But... look, I want to cooperate, all right? Come down.
GID00083976	The collar's done its work, or we wouldn't be at this point.
GID00083977	No traps, just a trade, you and the vault, me and the exit.
GID00083978	Greed implies you want more than you deserve. You've earned this.
GID00083979	You're right, you have everything - except the vault.
GID00083980	But all of that - all of that wasn't an obstacle, it drove you here.
GID00083981	Time is a commodity you don't have.
GID00083982	If it has a lock... and it should... I can pick it. Somehow.
GID00083983	I already managed to unlock the elevator and get down here before you. Better hurry.
GID00083984	As long as you can find me, you mean.
GID00083985	You'd have to find me first. The Sierra Madre basement's bigger than you'd expect.
GID00083986	Fine, stay up there and wait. I'll keep busy down here.
GID00083987	The size of the lock doesn't matter, only the contents.
GID00083988	So there is a lock? Good. Wasn't sure until you said so.
GID00083989	Yeah... well... I'll pick this lock, no matter how tough.
GID00083990	You know the Sierra Madre's a huge combination lock. Me? I've almost cracked it.
GID00083991	Foresight, whatever it is, won't help you spot me.
GID00083992	I've gotten past everything the Sierra Madre's thrown at me. You're no different.
GID00083993	If you want me to wait, I'll cooperate. The Sierra Madre doesn't matter to me.
GID00083994	Before this goes any farther, I had questions.
GID00083995	What happened next?
GID00083996	There's something else I wanted to know.
GID00084038	Now, now... I'll let you out when the event's over. Maybe.
GID00084039	Stop banging on elevator. Annoying.
GID00084040	Save your energy, we still have to pull this off.
GID00084041	If you keep hitting metal, you'll hurt your hand.
GID00084042	Must be you, Christine. Sit tight, not like you have a choice.
GID00084043	Silent girl is going to make Ghost People show up with noise.
GID00084044	Christine? We're almost ready here.
GID00084045	Christine, almost ready, Christine.
GID00084046	Only a little longer, and we'll open the casino.
GID00084047	Only a little while before open big casino.
GID00084048	<Give two taps back.>
GID00084049	Tap-tap back.
GID00084050	Let's do this. On the count of three... two... one.
GID00084051	All right, on the count of... um. One?
GID00084052	I'm ready. Everyone - trigger the event.
GID00084053	Can we go now? Want to get inside casino.
GID00084054	Show's about to begin. People, take your places.
GID00084055	Time for a show. Come on, show, start.
GID00084057	Um, trade? I... have stuff.
GID00084058	Do you have anything I can buy?
GID00084060	Bye-bye, light person.
GID00084061	Goodbye.
GID00084094	Just mad ramblings. He didn't make much sense.
GID00084095	He explained the search for the Sierra Madre... healed him.
GID00084097	It's better you don't. Let me hold onto it.
GID00084098	Some last words - a message. Nothing important.
GID00084099	Can you unlock it for me first? He was... vague on that point.
GID00084100	I found Elijah.
GID00084102	I had to kill him.
GID00084104	He left this holo-message. Here.
GID00084105	You should listen to this.
GID00084106	You should watch it.
GID00084108	What did he say to you?
GID00084110	I had to trap him inside a Pre-War... prison.
GID00084128	Where is he now?
GID00084129	Who was this Father Elijah to you?
GID00084131	I want you to attack enemies the moment you see them.
GID00084132	I want you not to attack enemies unless I've already engaged them.
GID00084133	On second thought, stick with me for a little longer.
GID00084134	Yes, I'm sure.
GID00084137	I think we should travel together.
GID00084138	Let's talk about your tactics.
GID00084139	I want you to change your combat style.
GID00084140	Let's talk about something else.
GID00084141	That's all. Let's get going.
GID00084142	Switch to a melee weapon.
GID00084143	I want you to use ranged weapons.
GID00084144	Let's talk about how close you're following me.
GID00084145	Stick close to me.
GID00084146	Stay close to me.
GID00084147	Your distance is good. Let's talk about something else.
GID00084148	All right, you're good. Let's get out of here.
GID00084149	Keep your distance. Try to flank them.
GID00084150	Enough about tactics.
GID00084176	Let's trade equipment.
GID00084177	It's time for us to part ways.
GID00084178	Goodbye.
GID00084179	That's enough for now.
GID00084180	That's enough for now.
