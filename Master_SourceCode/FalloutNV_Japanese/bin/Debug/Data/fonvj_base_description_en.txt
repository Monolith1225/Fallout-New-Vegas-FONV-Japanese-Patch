GID00000587	Caravan is not played in casinos, but is very popular among caravan guards and other frequent travelers on the Long 15.

GID00000596	If you see a red shield next to an enemy's health, it means that their armor's Damage Threshold is absorbing your weapon's damage. A broken red shield means you have completely negated their Damage Threshold.
GID00000597	If you see a shield next to a your health HUD, it means that your Damage Threshold is absorbing an enemy weapon's damage. A broken shield means they have completely negated your Damage Threshold.

GID00000608	The higher the Charisma, the higher the Nerve. Nerve grants significant combat bonuses to all companions.
GID00000609	"Prospector" is a polite word for "scavenger". Prospectors can be found all over the Mojave Wasteland, usually looking for the rare unopened safe at the bottom of an irradiated mineshaft.
GID00000610	Though people around New Vegas have little interest in Pre-War tourist trinkets, there is one influential figure who has a soft spot for snow globes...
GID00000611	Magazines provide temporary bonuses to skills but are much more common than the highly-prized skill books.
GID00000612	The Wild Wasteland trait converts a few normally "ordinary" occurences into zany, wacky encounters. Do not take this trait unless you prefer your Fallout experience to be a bit more goofy than usual.
GID00000613	The Shotgun Surgeon perk negates 10 points of enemy Damage Threshold while you are using any shotgun - handy for taking out lightly-armored opponents who would normally foil your buckshot.
GID00000614	With Splash Damage, all of your explosions are increased in size, allowing you to carpet bomb an even larger area.
GID00000615	Sad that you're too weak to keep a light machine gun on target? Take the Weapon Handling perk to remove 2 points from all weapon Strength requirements.
GID00000616	Do companions annoy you by constantly running into your bullets and missiles? Take the Spray and Pray perk to drastically reduce the amount of damage your attacks inflict on all currently hired companions.
GID00000617	Not sure what your reputation is with a current group? If you've earned one, you can find it in your Pip-Boy under Stats - General.
GID00000618	The distinctive black ranger combat armor consists of the Desert Rangers' traditional trench coat worn with Pre-War riot armor. Ranger patrol armor is hand-manufactured in the NCR.

GID00000620	Legate Lanius, the Monster of the East, is the military commander of all Caesar's forces in the field. He is legendary for his devotion to Caesar and for his ability to sense weakness in any army.
GID00000621	After the Legion lost the Battle of Hoover Dam, Caesar had his legate, Joshua Graham, covered in pitch, set on fire, and thrown into the Grand Canyon. Superstitious legionaries and tribals believe he lives on as the Burned Man.
GID00000622	The King is dedicated to the cause of independence and personal liberty in Freeside. His gang, the Kings, attempts to keep some semblance of order in the streets.
GID00000623	Due to disagreements over how technology should be controlled in the wasteland, the Brotherhood of Steel waged a long and bloody war against the NCR. Despite superior equipment and training, the Brotherhood eventually went into retreat.
