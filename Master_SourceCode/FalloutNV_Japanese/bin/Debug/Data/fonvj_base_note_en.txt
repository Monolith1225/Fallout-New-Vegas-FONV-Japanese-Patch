GID00050567	First attempts at atmospheric pinging returned negative. Considering that the motivators are still non-functional, it's going to be difficult to catch much of anything that doesn't pass directly over us. Still, I cannot rule out other mechanical failure. I haven't got much astronomical reference material with me, but maybe I can find an old chart and wait until a celestial body passes over to confirm signal. Of course, that may take years. I'll have to keep working on the motivators.
GID00050568	You are standing on a narrow stone path in a dark marsh. Greasy bubbles float to the top of the bog-waters on either side and pop lazily, spattering your legs with muck and slime. A short, stone tower squats here. No door is visible, and the stones are smooth and polished. A balcony juts out midway up the tower's face. The heady smells of incense mix with the nauseating stench of the swamp. The stone path unfurls eastward, towards a broad plain beyond the marshes.
GID00050569	A wizard is here, gesticulating wildly from his balcony.
GID00050570	Finally got to begin on my work in earnest today. Dish motivators are offline, but I was able to input some basic coordinates and ping nearby satcom arrays to the southwest and east. There was some interference pinging the NN-03d array. Probably Radroaches or something making a nest in the dishes. It may be worth sending one or two of the mercs over there to clean it out in case I can use those towers to amplify my own signal.
GID00050571	There were dozens of military satellites in orbit, just from the old records I found in the ruins. There must have been hundreds before the war. If I can find just a few operational platforms...
GID00050573	Thanks to a little creative wiring, I was able to tap us into a power source. They're less common up here, but if you know where to look, there are still plenty of live power lines buried all over the Wasteland. For all their arrogance, they knew a thing or two about engineering before the bombs. I have to admit; it's remarkable that there's still power to be had after all these years.
GID00050574	Now that we've got all the power we'd want, I can bring our defensive turret online and try to get the dish motors operational.
GID00050575	Nothing says "equality" like a fistful of caps. I think these Talon Company mercs are about the most cordial smoothies I've met, as long as their boss is getting paid. Luckily, money's no issue; I've hoarded plenty of it up since before these guys' parents were knee-high on a Brahmin.
GID00050576	Of course, if I succeed in this, it won't matter how many caps any of these rat bastards have.
GID00050577	To: Private Erwin
GID00050578	If I hear of you pulling another prank on one of my troopers that causes them to return to duty without their clothing fully intact, I will personally make sure you get transferred to Camp Forlorn Hope and don't come back.
GID00050579	I'll be watching you.

GID00050581	To: Private Jackson
GID00050582	This is the last time I take your advice. I went to the bar at Gomorrah, like you said. I got piss drunk, kicked out after getting too friendly with the dancers, fell into the gutter and puked all over myself before being picked up by some MP's.
GID00050583	Next thing I know I'm waking up in the drunk tank two days later. Thanks for wasting my pass, jerk.
GID00050584	Private Daniels
GID00050585	The key to avoiding the artillery is to move from building-to-building up the northwest side of town toward the front gate. Stick to the high cover in the northeast corner of the two buildings, then make a bee line for the gate. The Boomers won't shoot at their own people, so stick to the fence until you make it to the gate. Also, I know there is an old train tunnel that enters the area from the south, but no one has ever come back out of there to say it is safe.
GID00050586	To: Private Humphreys
GID00050587	This has been the best 3-day pass yet. I learned my lesson early and ditched the casinos for the girls at Gomorrah. Now that is money well spent. You can't get that kind of service at Camp Golf.
GID00050588	Going to sleep now while it's daylight and head back out to Gomorrah tonight for one last hurrah.

GID00050590	Dear Bravo Company,
GID00050591	Being transferred to the NCR Embassy on the Strip has been the greatest thing that has happened to me since joining the NCR. It's a pretty easy gig watching the troopers during the day and making sure they don't get in trouble and then we get to spend our free time hanging out at the bars and clubs, getting drunk and partying.
GID00050592	Wish you were here.

GID00050595	The Vault has been breached. There was not enough power to level Five!
GID00050596	God have mercy on our souls.
GID00050597	Dear Die-ary,
GID00050598	Good news Die-ary! I think it's finally starting to happen. Ok, so I do feel like, totally miserable (what else is new ha-ha-ha) and my skin is starting to peel off, but I'm pretty sure that is the first step. Oh, and my hair! I finally got it just the way I like it and now it starts coming out. Why does ghoulification have to be so unfair?
GID00050599	Dear Die-ary,
GID00050600	I've been in this shack for almost a week now. Nothing is happening. I'm so bored. And this shack is so hot. And it's totally ruining my hair. It's like, so hard to find dye this color in the wasteland. This sucks, I want to be a ghoul now. I hate all this waiting. Life, ugh, living is so overrated.
GID00050601	Dear Die-ary,
GID00050602	I'm so done being confined in this human body. So, today I moved in to the shack at the abandoned test site. There should be enough radiation there to turn me into a ghoul. All around me this world is bleak and dreadful; is it so wrong to want a body to match it? I wonder what color my skin will turn and if I'll be able to find a good shade of lipstick to go with it. Probably not. God, everything is so miserable.
GID00050603	Chomps Lewis complained that the replacement generator the NCR sent to Quarry Junction isn't working. No one at Quarry Junction has the skill to fix the problem.

GID00050608	Sgt. Platner volunteered to go outside today to take specific readings on the atmosphere. It seems the radiation has not spread this far. Since he was wearing his Power Armor, there was no threat to him from radiation, but if he had been exposed he would have had to be exiled. We don't have adequate decontamination facilities here.

GID00050612	I can't believe those bastards finally did it. Damn them all to hell. They finally let the A-Bombs fly. We were right in the middle of trying to pry the real story out of von Felden when we completely lost contact.
GID00050613	I have a feeling the research center was hit hard. I don't know why, just call it a gut feeling. It seems inconceivable that we were not targeted. I'm sure China will make up for that oversight real soon. Luckily, we had moved our families from outside into the facility the day before yesterday. We do not yet know if the fallout has reached this area.

GID00050627	What the hell is going on? We declare ourselves to be in full desertion from the Army and no longer under the government's command and what happens? Nothing. Something bad is coming down.
GID00050628	I finally replied to the outside world over our radio. I don't know why they never sent anyone here to see what was happening when we stopped responding to their transmissions.
GID00050629	It doesn't make any sense. Well, they'll come now. I declared ourselves seceded from the union. They remember Jefferson Davis. What will history say about me?
GID00050630	By killing the egghead, I seem to have confirmed my position as leader of the men. They follow me without question now. The interrogations invariably end up being executions.
GID00050631	Shellman held out the longest, but the end result was the same. Her arguments about her orders were a bit too specific to be completely made up. I'm getting a real bad feeling in my gut about how this is all going to end up. I don't even lie to myself anymore about my reasons for executing the scientists.
GID00050632	I tried again to speak to the colonel through the door, but he seems to have completely lost touch with reality. I broke down the door with several of the men just in time to watch him blow his head off. Right before he pulled the trigger he said he was sorry.
GID00050633	I killed a man today. I was interrogating Chief Scientist Anderson and he was giving me the full details of their inhuman experiments. He said his orders came from the government, but I didn't buy it. He started screaming about how he was following orders, how he was a military man, and I just shot him. I tell myself it was to keep him from causing a full mutiny among the men, but I'm not so sure.
GID00050634	Every time we get a report from higher up things get worse here. The war is going in a very bad direction and this place is about to go into full mutiny, with all the chaos that entails.
GID00050635	I stopped one of the men from executing a scientist today, and demanded that we interrogate them to find out what their orders were.
GID00050636	People are really starting to get antsy around here. I've had to break up three fights this week alone. If the lockdown continues for much longer, p-
GID00050637	Hold that thought, I've got what looks to be one of our patrols returning. Only one of them, though. There must've been trouble.
GID00050638	I, Roger Maxson, Captain, serial number 072389 have started this log because it doesn't look good for any of us, and I'd like for people to know what really happened here.
GID00050639	All hell broke loose when we finally discovered what those scientist bastards were up to. The Colonel has locked himself in his office and seems to be having some sort of breakdown.
GID00050640	The men are screaming for blood. They're looking to me for answers, and I'm not sure what to do. Someone has to do something, though, before this place sinks into an anarchistic bloodbath.
GID00050641	People are really starting to get antsy around here. I've had to break up three fights this week alone. If the lockdown continues for much longer, p-
GID00050642	Hold that thought, I've got Veronica and a stranger approaching the outer door. She's not scheduled back yet, but that's never stopped her before, I suppose...
GID00050643	People are really starting to get antsy around here. I've had to break up three fights this week alone. If the lockdown continues for much longer, p-
GID00050644	Hold that thought, I've got a stranger approaching the outer door. Might have to do a meet and greet.
GID00050645	Those gangsters at the Tops cheated me. I know it, they're cheats and liars and thieves, their games are rigged. I've lost every last cap, every NCR bill I had left. Those slot machines, you can never win. They're programmed to just make you lose lose lose. Their cards are marked so their dealers can cheat you, I promise you this. Invisible ink or something. And their roulette tables? Please, what a joke. The ball must be magnetic, and they can tell it to land wherever they want. The people that do win there are plants, employees. There's no way I could have lost like that unless they were cheating, no way. No way.
GID00050646	Those fancy suits can't buy them class, they're just a bunch of damn con men. They've taken everything from me. I have nothing left. Nothing...
GID00050647	What am I going to do? I was supposed to win big here, this is where dreams happen. People told me I could make a fortune here, I just had to have the caps, and I could win myself a new future, now it's all gone, all gone...
GID00050648	A few of our best men headed out around the same time as the patrols without my knowing about it. When I asked the Elder, he said they were on an important mission. Too important to tell his Chief of Security about? Something's up...
GID00050649	Dear Tracy,
GID00050650	Things have been going well for me here in Vegas. I've had pretty decent luck at the tables lately and have been able to almost break even. I'm going to hit the roulette tables again tomorrow - I'm going to win big this time, real big. I can feel it.
GID00050651	Wish me luck!
GID00050652	Mark
GID00050653	Still no word from the missing patrols. I was beginning to get my hopes up that the Elder was close to ending the lockdown when they were sent out, but now...
GID00050654	Bruce,
GID00050655	I think it's time we see other people. We're just not a good fit anymore. Besides, I met this amazing and rich guy at The Ultra-Luxe last night. He's a real winner, not a dirty farmhand like yourself.
GID00050656	I never want to see you again.
GID00050657	Lacy
GID00050658	Nicole,
GID00050659	All my years of hard work have finally paid off. I hit the jackpot last night over at The Tops! I'll have to use a lot of the money to pay off some of the debts I've accrued over the years, but there is plenty left over to live well for the rest of our lives. I told you it'd happen!
GID00050660	See you soon!

GID00050662	Dear Diary,
GID00050663	The animals, they are evil. They tried to eat me in my sleep. They want the farm for themselves. Now that Mom and Dad are gone they want the farm for themselves. They are plotting against me, plotting to eat me. They are becoming ghouls like my parents and they want to eat me like my parents did. Too many of them to kill them all. I know what I'll do, I'll burn the house down around me, then the animals can't eat me because there will be nothing left for them to eat!
GID00050664	The system has detected flooding on the third floor. All doors to the third floor have been automatically sealed.
GID00050665	Hey Mom!
GID00050666	I have some good news and some bad news. The good news is that I didn't lose all my money on the 'silly gambling games' as you call them. The bad news is that I lost all my money on one of the girls at Gomorrah. You would have liked her though, she was a real classy lady. Well, since there's nothing left for me here and I'm all out of caps, I'll be heading home soon.
GID00050667	Love you!
GID00050668	Dennis
GID00050669	Dear Diary,
GID00050670	I hate being all alone, I want my Mom and Dad back, but I can't have them back because I killed them. I didn't want to kill them but I had to kill them, otherwise they would have eaten me. I hope the animals don't eat me. Can animals become ghouls?

GID00050681	Billy, don't be mad, but I lost all our savings at The Tops last night. It's not my fault, I was on a hot streak and was up 2000 caps, but then I had a run of bad luck and lost it all. I'm going to go see if I can scrounge up a few caps and try to get it all back. Please don't hate me.
GID00050682	Sue
GID00050683	Dear Diary,
GID00050684	I took a chance today and left the animals alone to go look for Mom and Dad. I found them in that camp, they had become horrible feral ghouls! I didn't know what to do, they came at me so fast. Oh god what have I done...
GID00050685	Dear Edna,
GID00050686	Lost all our money at the casinos. Send more ASAP. Will get it all back. Trust me.
GID00050687	Lenny
GID00050688	Dear Diary,
GID00050689	Mom and Dad went into the NCR camp nearby to trade for supplies but they haven't come back yet. I hope nothing bad has happened to them.
GID00050690	Isaac,
GID00050691	I need to increase the number of weapons and crates of ammunition from our previous arrangement. Things might heat up with Caesar's Legion again and we'd like to be prepared. We need to increase the number of weapons by 25% and ammunition by 50%.

GID00050701	After going to enormous lengths to procure DNA samples of hypothesized forebears, we cannot explain why ancestry evidence is present from two vastly different creatures; the Limulus polyphemus (horseshoe crab) and the Callinectes sapidus (blue crab). It's obvious that a mutation occurred, giving this creature bipedal movement and massive growth, but I cannot explain the presence of multiple subphylum markers in DNA/RNA. Given their mystifying origins, I have decided the species deserves its own classification, and have thus dubbed them "Scylla Serrata Horrendus." They can often be found in sewers and caves and should be considered hostile and very dangerous, as their chitnous shell provides excellent resistance to both firearms and hand-held weapons. They are disgusting creatures, and I cannot fathom their popularity as a food source among the citizens of the Wasteland.
GID00050702	To Whom It May Concern (You!),
GID00050703	We got some pretty good stuff from the last raid, and unlike last time, I don't want any incidents. The only logical conclusion was to hide everything throughout this room. If you can read this, you have my permission to use any items you can find.

GID00050719	What does it mean? Why was there a blue star under my bottle cap? Are the Red's behind this? Is this part of their mind control? They must be making me see things now, things that shouldn't be there. The star shouldn't be there, why do I see a star? It won't go away. No matter how long I close my eyes it won't go away. I want the star to go away!
GID00050720	I saw one of the guys in the mess hall pull a bottle cap off a Sunset Sarsaparilla and then run to his room. I knew he was hiding something so I broke into his room when he wasn't there and saw the bottle cap. It had a blue star underneath it. I think he's been marked for something but I can't figure out what. All I know is I want that bottle cap.

GID00050761	Entry #2257
GID00050762	During my off duty hours I decided to investigate the trade route being used to bring the supplies to the camp. I met a traveler on the road and asked him if he had seen any NCR supplies bound for Camp Searchlight. He told me he had seen some NCR crates being moved somewhere outside of Nipton but didn't know where they were being taken. He also mentioned that the men with the supplies didn't look like NCR soldiers. Next time I have enough time off I'll have to make my way to Nipton to see if anyone there knows where the supplies are.

GID00050764	Entry #1836
GID00050765	Supplies being shipped to the camp recently are lower than usual. I asked the Comm Officer if there were any problems with communications and he insisted that everything was fine. I contacted our supply base and was simply told that all inventory requests were being filled and that every item on my request list had been shipped to the camp. Either I'm being lied to or someone is intercepting my shipments. I'll have to look into this matter further.
GID00050766	This holotape contains a list a patrol reports dating back the last few months. Aside from an incident where an NCR patrol was wiped out by one of its own grenades - the result of trooper negligence - the reports are otherwise unremarkable.

GID00050768	Notice to all Good Men and Women seeking Lawful Bounties in the Capital Wastes:
GID00050769	Let it be known that the murderous person known as JUNDERS PLUNKETT, of fair complexion, average height, and missing one good eyeball, is offered for bounty, either DEAD OR ALIVE, in the sum of 1,000 caps or similar compensation of expended equipment and/or medical expense.
GID00050770	JUNDERS PLUNKETT was last seen committing theft and murder in the township of Cantebury Commons. The apprehending person should exercise special caution, as the bountied personage is noted for an uncommon aptitude with small, concealable blades.
GID00050771	After Action for Incident FS-87,
GID00050772	Victims include 4 NCR Militiamen - squad was most likely on an unregistered patrol as they were not being observed until after the attack. Assailants believed to be raiders (likely Great Khans) with hunting dogs (two dog corpses were left in the scuffle - tracks suggest as many as a dozen in the attacking pack).
GID00050773	Threat Assessment: Trivial. Great Khans with dogs present virtually no matter of trouble. Incident likely caused by unskilled NCR patrolmen failing to radio us for an eyes-on backup.
GID00050774	Radioed HQ with report at 12:40, received Hanlon's confirmation at 12:42 that he received the details.
GID00050775	The cells are still replicating normally. No mutation. Thank God. If whatever's out there could penetrate this Vault, I can't even begin to imagine what the Overseer would do.

GID00050781	I'm sorry I stole it. You deserve to have it back. Remember the old scrapyard, north of the Bethesda ruins? Look in the burned out bus in the northwest corner. Near an old red boxcar.
GID00050782	Tell Loreen I still love her, and I'm sorry for everything. I hope somebody finds this before the buzzards tear it to pieces.

GID00050787	Two more reports of Mirelurk noise from the bow section. There isn't a damn thing that can be done about it. As soon as we clean out one nest, another moves in. I just wish everyone would stop bitching about it.
GID00050788	Railing on the flight deck is still broken. Problem has been referred to the council.
GID00050789	Brock got in a fight with that Sister character. If it happens again, I'm going to have to kick Sister off the ship.

GID00050791	For immediate release:
GID00050792	Due to the unfortunate demise of one of the security personal, we have an opening on the Rivet City Security Force. Qualified applicants must know how to fire a gun without shooting themselves in the ass. Furthermore, all applicants must be Rivet City citizens in good standing. The pay is free food. Anyone interested should see the Security Chief.
GID00050800	Congratulations on receiving your new DCTA Standard-Issue Laser Pistol!
GID00050801	Please take a few minutes to go over the guidelines posted in the DCTA Employee Handbook; Section 28.1.1.b, and reprinted below for your convenience.
GID00050802	Section 28.1.1.b - Proper Laser Pistol Usage
GID00050803	It should be noted that all DCTA property should be handled with the utmost care, and used only when necessary. Maintaining personal safety during a Communist attack is a good example of proper usage of your standard issue laser pistol. However, rodent population control is an inappropriate use and subject to disciplinary action, as noted in Section 11.3.5.c
GID00050804	Section 28.1.1.b.1 - Maintaining Safe Conditions With the Laser Pistol
GID00050805	Using this laser pistol in the DCTA Metro facility can be beneficial in many ways, but the operator must observe his or her surroundings before deciding to fire. The subway utility pipes often serve as conduit to transport highly flammable gasses. Firing the laser pistol in the presence of a gas leak could cause an undesired explosion and/or severe personal injury.
GID00050806	Section 28.1.1.b.2 - Operating the Laser Pistol Within Proper Specifications
GID00050807	It is required that all DCTA Employees keep the laser pistol pulse energy, length and repetition rate within the specifications diagrammed in the Laser Pistol User's Manual. Failure to do so could result in severe reprimands from the DCTA Regulatory Committee as well as serious personal injury.

GID00050822	I've been reading the bulletin boards for months now; I believe we have a spy among us, one of the Reds pretending to be a Blue. They are using the bulletin boards to communicate; I believe they want me to see it.
GID00050823	You're standing in the dusty market square of a quiet town. Many of the shops and homes lie abandoned, and the citzens that can be seen speak in hushed voices, casting furtive glances at the darkened skyline in the distant north. The ringing of an anvil breaks the silence regularly, where a mustachioed blacksmith bends over his work in a nearby tent.

They are all chirpy and don't appear to mind that Cesar is crusin' for a bruisin' all over the place. Maybe the NCR is stronger than we thought, uh? Don't know... you think we can trust them over Mr. House?
GID00050847	I still feel all clutched over what he did to our home! I mean, yeah it is good that we got to keep part of our vault but I can't shake the thought that one of these days he'll just push me out into the open - once he does not need us any more. I tell you, we should have never accepted his challenge. That shuckster cheated us, I am sure!

If I can get to her and show her my Gutsies before anyone else can turn her against me, she'll be impressed and that'll do it. It *has* to do it. It's not like every man out there can fix up a robot. I'll tell her she'd never have to do housework, that'd be the clincher. It would be so nice not to have to pay Rosie.

GID00050862	Okay, we're making good headway cleaning up the paths. With only the 12 of us, I'm amazed we've moved this much rock in such a short time. Kale and I made it to the top yesterday. The survey team was right. Guardian Peak has one hell of a view, but we still have a lot of work ahead of us. I sent our runner to Bravo to request a radio from McCarran. There isn't much point in having an overwatch camp here if it takes us at least an hour to sprint to Bravo to report a Legion Assault.
GID00050863	Matsumoto cornered me in the hall like a wild animal today! Kept asking if I was all right, but I see the lies bubbling in his throat behind that sussurating smile. He knows. He must know. Has my brother gotten to him, too? Have to talk to Cindy-Lou, she always knows what to do.
GID00050864	It's worse than I feared. Henderson sent a 10-point memo outlining the benefits of mechanization and automation. As if I wouldn't know he's been plotting with my half-brother the entire time! I knew he was a weasel-dick traitor from the moment I laid eyes on him. Only one thing to do. One thing, and the company - my father's LEGACY - is safe forever. Cindy-Lou will bring him to me, and then I'll make an example. The Bastard will learn why you don't cross the House.
GID00050874	I'm beginning to mistrust Henderson. I think he's conspiring with my bastard half-brother to seize the company. I built this company, dammit! I won't be ousted by some Johnny-come-lately fancy college man with his robots and his degrees. I've asked Cindy-Lou to keep an eye on him, to monitor his e-mail for suspicious activity.
GID00050875	Lieutenant Hayes,
GID00050876	You and your men are ordered to secure the area around Primm in preparation for the assault on the prison. Recon indicates that the powder gangers are lax in their defenses and should quickly fall to a surprise assault. In the unlikely event that the attack fails, you are to hold position near Primm and await further instructions.

GID00050879	As the years roll on, I find myself missing Father's advice more and more. I wonder if he would be proud of the decisions I've made - but no, such second-guessing does me no good.

GID00050884	Hello fellow H&H employees!
GID00050885	Mr. H has asked me to pass on the details of our new security systems. This is very important, so please read it and confirm via e-mail that you understand the procedures!
GID00050886	1) Automated heavy turrets have been installed in both cubicle areas, the central catwalk, and outside Mr. H's office. YOU MUST HAVE YOUR ID PASS ON YOU at all times, or the turrets will open fire, and we certainly don't want that, do we? :-) Remember, no sudden movements until you hear the "click!" That means the turret has recognized your ID signature and you're safe to pass!
GID00050887	2) Employees must submit at least one of the following on the first payday of each month: one vial of blood, 20 nail clippings (toenail or fingernail is fine, but *NOT* a mix of both), one lock of hair, or a 5 square centimeter skin sample. These samples will be retained for monitoring purposes.
GID00050888	3) Any employee seen to be cohabitating, colluding, or cogitating with any of the following groups will be terminated immediately: foreigners, Masons, carpenters, Tragic players, illegal aliens, extraterrestrials or the Flemish.
GID00050889	4) If you see Mr. H in the halls, DO NOT make eye contact. Making eye contact with Mr. H will be seen as an attempt to steal his thought energy and will be grounds for immediate dismissal. Yes, even if Mr. H is wearing his special hat.
GID00050890	Thank you all for your patience with our little reorganization. Now, get out there and make the best gosh-darn tools in the West!

GID00050894	The chassis are easily opened, allowing the weapon to be serviced in the field. Purified water and a clean cloth can be used to wash mirrored and glass components, slowing wear on the weapon. The weapon can also overheat after a period of intense use. This can be counteracted by submerging the barrel of the weapon in water, which helps cool heat sinks located beneath the chassis shell in that area.

GID00050923	Power drawn from Micro fusion Cell is processed through a Wave/Particle Diverter (manuf:Gen Atomics Intnl). Diverters are protected by carbon-fiber housing, preventing frequent malfunction, but when a diverter fails the weapon becomes unusable, and this part is extremely difficult to replace or repair.
GID00050924	Precision-cut lenses focus optic energy. Lenses are prone to damage and can grossly affect precision of the firing weapon's firing mechanism. Lenses are easily replaced with any clear glass, but require a great deal of skill to fabricate.

GID00051007	Patient: Peters, Harrison T.
GID00051008	Update: Dr. Peters is dead. His vitals flatlined ten minutes before he entered surgery. I decided to perform an autopsy immediately, and discovered his lungs were filled with some sort of fungal infection. Strangely, the fungus still shows evidence of growth despite the death of its host. I'll consult with one of the mycologists on the fifth level and see if they can identify it.

GID00051069	When ignited and used properly, the Shishkebab provides two important functions in a melee: slashing and burning.
GID00051070	Mr. House, with the help of The Families, had transformed the mostly unharmed ruins of Las Vegas into a paradise. It resembled the city that we remembered thanks to the stories and items that our forefathers told and secured in Vault 21 after The Cataclysm.
GID00051071	We were awe-struck and cautious, at once. Slowly, we left the confines of the vault and settled within New Vegas, aiding in its reconstruction.
GID00051072	Vault 21, a giant complex of functioning machinery, became a great source of materials with which to rebuild New Vegas.
GID00051073	Mr. House stripped the vault and filled its empty husk with concrete - only leaving behind part of the vault's top level. This section is where you now find hospice and where the warmth of our ancient home remains alive for all to enjoy!
GID00051074	We have come to recognize the wisdom of Mr. House in forging a new and brighter future for all generations of New Vegas' inhabitants. Without his leadership, the barren wasteland would have remained uncivilized, savage and brutal for all time.
GID00051075	We sincerely hope that you join us in celebrating the glory of New Vegas and the memory of Vault 21's legacy!

GID00051094	Seven years ago, Mr. House rebuilt and organized the great city of New Vegas. Vault 21 rests in the middle of The Strip, and it was inevitable that it would become part of the city's bright future. Mr. House contacted our community and offered us to participate in the resurgence of New Vegas.
GID00051095	Most Vault 21 dwellers refused the offer - life was comfortable, safe and fruitful. We had grown so accustomed to the benefits of our isolated society that we could not conceive leaving it behind for an unknown future teetering on a precarious balance. Still, there were some among us who disagreed with the prevailing wisdom.
GID00051096	They challenged, on Mr. House's behalf, each of the vault-levels' representatives that supported continuing our isolation. According to the custom, a game would be set up where the winner would decide the course of the community's future.
GID00051097	A game of blackjack was scheduled and held in this very level of Vault 21. After many hours of grueling struggle, Mr. House's supporters won in an extremely risky, and fateful, gambit. They decided to open up the doors to the outside world.
GID00051098	The rest upheld our system and remained true to their promise to abide by the victor's decision.
GID00051099	After almost two hundred years within Vault 21's halls, we released the seals of the ancient doors. We opened to a new world.
GID00051100	Reactor Terminal.
GID00051101	Vault 21 has a story unlike any other Nuclear Fallout Shelter - you are about to learn why!
GID00051102	It is common knowledge that some vaults were built and organized with motives that went beyond their function as safeguards of our last great hope: the hope that humanity would survive even the worst catastrophe imaginable - Nuclear War.
GID00051103	Vault 21 was one of these experimental vaults. In the spirit of Las Vegas, our vault was built and organized around gambling!
GID00051104	Everything you will see here follows the idea that humans can coexist and organize their lives based on the principle that skill is the only factor that should tip the blind balance held by Lady Luck.
GID00051105	We embodied the perfect equilibrium between self-reliance and social equality.
GID00051106	Each level of Vault 21 was symmetrical and transparent. Each room looked exactly like the next, and every gambling place was built in plain sight, so that no person would have advantage over another.
GID00051107	Thanks to this, quarrels in our society were solved from an equal starting ground - the best won, just like our American Dream promised so long ago!
GID00051108	After two-hundred years of living in harmony, we finally awoke to the nature of the outside world when Mr. House, in his able wisdom, resurrected our lost city as New Vegas!
GID00051109	Carla,
GID00051110	If you're reading this, then you know. Sorry. Wanted to make it back home to you.
GID00051111	The pension won't be much but it should help you and the baby get by. Want you to remarry when you meet the right person. Don't want you to have to be on your own.
GID00051112	Not sure the right way to say how I feel about you. Think you know already, though. Always seemed like you knew what I meant, maybe better than I did. Wish I was there with you now.
GID00051113	There are things I couldn't tell you. Tried. Whatever you learn over time about my service in the NCR, hope you can forgive me.
GID00051114	Lastly, know you were against it, but if it's a girl, want her to be named after her mother. Know it's playing dirty to win the argument this way, but too bad. It's worth it.

GID00051136	Dearest Andrew,
GID00051137	Writing this seems pretty morbid, but tomorrow we march into the no man's land between our camp and Nelson, which is crawling with Legion. The Major insisted I write this damn "if you get this, I'm dead" letter so here it is. What a crock. I have the luck of the devil and your love on my side, so I'll be home soon. Keep the porch light on for me.
GID00051138	We'll party in New Vegas when I get back.
GID00051139	I love you.
GID00051140	Devin
GID00051141	To my brothers,
GID00051142	If you're reading this, then I was probably killed by some slimy Legion scum who got lucky. Hopefully the bastard is dead and six feet under, but if not, you better avenge me or I will haunt you until the day you die.
GID00051143	Quincy
GID00051144	p.s. Kill all the Legion dogs that I wasn't able to.
GID00051145	Dear Sister,
GID00051146	They're sending me into the no-man's land tomorrow, and by the time you read this, I'll be dead. That means that once again you were right and I was wrong. Ever since we were kids, I was always a thorn in your side, always doing everything you told me not to. Now, as I'm about to go off to my death, I realize you were only looking out for me all these years. I'm so sorry.
GID00051147	I can only hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me.
GID00051148	Kevin
GID00051149	To my darling Gracie,
GID00051150	Know that I died fighting for what I believed in. I know you never understood why I had to do this, but I'm thankful that you supported me anyway. I appreciated every letter you sent. They gave me hope when we had none out here. You were always the one thing keeping me going, and I thank you for that. I wish that this could have turned out differently, but know that I loved you with all my heart.
GID00051151	Geoff
GID00051152	Dear Ma and Pa,
GID00051153	If you're getting this letter, then I'm sure you've already heard the news. I'm sorry, but know now that I'm in a better place. Tell Mikey I did good, okay?
GID00051154	You were the best family ever and I hope I've made you all proud.
GID00051155	Will
GID00051156	Audrey,
GID00051157	Things have gotten pretty grim since my last letter. The conditions here at Forlorn Hope just keep getting worse and worse - food is scarce, medicine and supplies are limited, and we're all scared out of our minds. We lose a handful of good men every day. It's hard seeing all your friends die.
GID00051158	The Major does his best to inspire hope and confidence, but it's just not working any more. Too many people have died here. Dr. Richards is a good man, if a little odd, but there's just too many wounded for him to handle.
GID00051159	Through all this strife, I take solace in the fact that I'm fighting to keep our family safe. And when the NCR wins this fight, it'll make the world a better place for all of us.
GID00051160	Take care of the kids and I'll write you again soon.
GID00051161	Ted
GID00051162	Dear Mom and Dad,
GID00051163	If you're reading this, you know I won't be coming home.
GID00051164	I'm sorry how this all ended. I'm sorry for all the times that I didn't listen to you. I'm sorry for storming out the way I did.
GID00051165	But I want you to know that you are the best parents anyone could ever have. You gave me everything I could have ever wanted, and I only now see that.
GID00051166	Thank you for everything.
GID00051167	Your son,
GID00051168	James
GID00051170	Dear Janey,
GID00051171	If you're reading this, that means I didn't make it. I want you to know that you were the most important thing in my world. You were my sun, my moon, my stars. Even out here on the battlefield I thought of you every minute of every day. At night, I put your picture on the bunk above me and looked into your beautiful eyes until I fell asleep.
GID00051172	Even though I'm gone, know that I'll always be with you. Just close your eyes and think of me and I'll be there, right by your side.
GID00051173	Daniel
GID00051174	The RC hydroponics have been restored to basic functionality - easy enough after all our research. The limited amount of clean water we can produce is enough for growing basic foodstuffs.
GID00051176	In any case, RC wouldn't work as a location for truly large scale decontamination. The infrastructure just isn't here, and the idea of recreating it again is too daunting to convince the rest of the council.
GID00051177	And that's even if the process worked.
GID00051179	To my dearest Ellen,
GID00051180	We're in a tough spot here and none of the men expect to make it out alive. Things look pretty grim. I'm writing this so that if anything happens to me, you know how much you meant to me.
GID00051181	I was foolish to join the NCR and leave you behind and I've regretted it every second of every day that I've been here. My only wish now is to see you again and hold you in my arms. The only thing that keeps me going are my thoughts of you.
GID00051182	Just know that I made mistakes, but you were the best thing that ever happened to me. I'm sorry, and I love you.
GID00051183	Harry
GID00051189	The Hidden Valley Bunker relies on two main systems:
GID00051190	The CANDLE Fusion Power system provides power to all bunker systems. Built more for reliability and duration of service, the power output of the system has been exceeded by many current designs, but it can supply the bunker with power for an estimated 752 years.
GID00051191	The DERVISH Camouflage system provides visual and electronic interference to prevent airborne or long-range enemy weapons from targeting the bunker. The normal soil around Hidden Valley has been supplemented with a combination of aluminum and various silicates, which are then dispersed using a widespread network of industrial fans to blanket the area in a cloud of what is essentially chaff. Combined with the electronic countermeasures of the nearby array at Black Mountain, the bunker at Hidden Valley is effectively impossible to target.
GID00051192	Ted,
GID00051194	I busted the storage door, down near the service entrance.
GID00051196	Restoring power to this broadcast station has amplified a faint signal being transmitted from somewhere in the nearby area.
GID00051197	Raquel, the Master at Arms for the Boomers, would be grateful if I brought her some missiles.
GID00051198	The blacksmith regards you gruffly and is about to dismiss you when you produce the polished gemstone from your bag. He sets his hammer aside and twirls his moustache.
GID00051199	"A right fine stone, that is." He says, admiring the faceted stone, "What would you be needin', then?"
GID00051200	Following your careful instructions, the smithy re-forges your rusty sword with the magical shard at the center of the blade.
GID00051201	Cachino's Journal documents a couple months of Cachino's activities. It contains a detailed ledger describing many of his business deals over the last few months, including the sales of chems and weapons. It is clear at a quick glance that these transactions are his own personal finances, and this is done behind the backs of the Omerta Family management structure.
GID00051202	He also talks, in great detail, about many sexual encounters with Gomorra prostitutes, including Joana.
GID00051203	After nearly every off-the-books sale, or sexual tryst he vows this one will be his last.
GID00051204	Your eyes water from the smoke and smarmy heat inside the tent. The huge man swipes sweat from his bald head and looks up from his work.
GID00051205	"There's no shortage of work to be done with Grelok scarin' everyone witless. Leave me to filling my orders, stranger." With that, the blacksmith dismisses you from his tent and douses a hot blade in water, hissing with steam.
GID00051206	Dear scumbags,
GID00051207	Thank you so much for destroying my equipment. I sincerely hope you appreciate the gifts I left for you.
GID00051208	Jas Wilkins at Quarry Junction wants you to obtain a deathclaw egg for her Wasteland Omelet recipe. The most likely location to find an egg is the deathclaw nest at the nearby limestone quarry.
GID00051209	Sunny Smiles told you that the old Goodsprings schoolhouse contains a safe which no one in town has been able to crack. She helpfully provided you with some bobby pins and a copy of the magazine "Locksmith's Reader" in case you wanted to take a shot at opening the safe.

GID00051211	Here I am, trapped in a room by myself typing on a terminal trying to keep myself busy. Hell trying to keep myself sane. I don't know what it is about this place, but I want to get out of here. Yeah, get out of here -- I can't even bring myself to open that damn door again. I hear those things wandering around outside, sniffing, screaming, doing whatever they do. When I first got here I thought the place was abandoned and went around looking for anything to scavenge. Five minutes later, I'm in this room scared half out of my mind. Things started chasing me, I fired a few shots, missed, and ran through the darkness. Ahh shit. Told ol' Billy to meet me here and bring some extra ammo and grenades. That was three days ago, poor guy probably didn't make it too far. Those things better have given him a quick death. Listen to me, babbling like a damn fool. Billy's all right. I'll just stick here until those things go away and meet up with him. Hah, what a story I have for him.

The door was sealed after them and additional guards were stationed at the exit; this proved to be a grave mistake. With the additional guards at the exit there were fewer to patrol the halls, none of them were prepared for the group that ambushed the armory. The guards were able to defend their position, but not before the damage was done, during the fight one of the reactors cooling vents was damaged.

GID00051278	Field observation suggests that the Bloatfly is a mutation of the Tabanus horse fly with provocative advances. These evolutionary forebears possessed neither the significant body mass, nor projectile sting of the Bloatfly. Dissection has revealed that this stinger is engorged with living pupae and neurotoxins. These projectiles are capable of incapacitating large prey on which the bloatfly and it's gestating young can freely feed. These neurotoxins are only nominally effective on humans, but can cause localized necrosis at the wound site. This observation is contrary to earlier assumptions that the Bloatfly was primarily a scavenger. The Bloatfly can be dispatched easily with light weapons, but nonetheless present a threat to field operatives, especially when encountered in numbers. They are hostile and can strike before the target is aware of its presence.

GID00051289	Endorsements: Human Dignity Bloc, United Vault Technicians Bloc
GID00051290	I'm aware of the rumors circulating about me. I want everyone to know that they are vicious lies being spread by the other candidates in a desperate smear campaign. I have never in my life done anything so depraved, let alone four such things. But even if I had, that still wouldn't mean you should vote for me. Consider the fact that I am grossly underqualified for the position, and that both of my opponents are far more deserving. I know nothing about governance. You would be hard pressed to find a worse candidate than me. I can promise you my administration would be a disaster.

GID00051293	This is ridiculous. I shouldn't even be a candidate. And I wouldn't be if it weren't for all the dirty backroom politics going on around here. It's sickening. You should all be ashamed.

GID00051301	Lab Report: Prototype ZRIN-418
GID00051302	Prototype refines acumist barrel experiments by addition of retardant jacketing, as well as internal heat diffusers. Rate of fire diminished from un-modified version of weapon. Conventional 10mm ammunition does not fully liquefy until impact, giving the 418 exceptional accuracy compared to earlier prototypes. Live-fire tests report no major casualties. Recommend ZRIN-418 as production candidate.
GID00051303	Lab Report: Prototype ZRIN-401
GID00051304	Prototype attempts to refine results of acumist coating within weapon barrel. Initial tests showed promise. As predicted, delivery friction super-heats projectile as it is delivered from the weapon, and conventional 10mm ammunition can be used. However; during live-fire testing, subjects firing the weapon in rapid succession suffered severe burns to the fingers and palm.

GID00051308	We've managed to shovel most of the debris up to the first bridge. This thing looks like a wreck. Thankfully, there were a few wooden shacks around we can dismantle for scrap to rebuild. I just hope we don't run out of scrap before we finish the trail. Jackson says he heard some kind of howling the other night. It sounded like the wind to me.
GID00051309	Lab Report: Prototype ZRIN-375
GID00051310	Prototype introduces proprietary ammunition type. Conventional 10mm shells house a caplet containing amalgamating agents. When the caplet was broken in lab tests, localized fireburst and shrapnel projection met requirements for project. However, in field tests amalgam caplet ammunition proved too fragile, and several detonated from excessive vibration or walk speed.

GID00051314	Experimental prototype makes extensive use of hardware common to liquid ammunition flame projection weapons. While initial test results were impressive, extreme weight of unit (118.3kg) and fume inhalation rendered most test subjects incapable of firing the unit or remaining conscious under typical field conditions.

GID00051339	I've asked Michelle to look in the surrounding areas, to see if there are any local schools that will be willing to take on some of our teachers and students. Between this prospect and the hopes of speedy repairs, this unexpected recess will be short.

GID00051370	Some of the Blues caused some trouble in the clinic today. I bet they were stealing drugs, I've heard the vents coming on late at night, others have too, and I bet they are using the drugs to poison us; stealing supplies from the clinic and using them to kill us all.

We've had some luck trading, and it looks like we are going to be operating at full capacity soon. Let's lock the doors for a little while, set up some guards. Let's be smart. We've all seen those freaks with the strange hats lurking around outside. Every day they get a little closer, let's show them that we aren't going to be easy targets. Let's be safe and smart.

GID00051406	I do not wish to get pulled down into petty political bickering. Bannon has not done anything wrong. If the time ever comes when he does something truly harmful to Rivet City, the other council members will look into it. Until then, I have a lab to run.

GID00051413	Doctor Li,
GID00051414	We both know that Bannon does not have the best interests of Rivet City at heart. He is only interested in making a profit. He would sell his own children, if he had any, for an extra bottle cap. He needs to be removed. I would be glad to step forward as his replacement.

GID00051420	- Mike
GID00051421	Had an idea for a survival weapon. There are all these railroad spikes laying around the wasteland. I ought to be able to build some sort of slingshot to fire them like bullets. I tried some really big rubber bands, but that didn't work. I wonder if I could use steam as a power source?
GID00051422	At a workbench, combine:
GID00051423	Wonderglue
GID00051424	Leather belt
GID00051425	Medical brace
GID00051426	Deathclaw hand
GID00051427	Now improved 20%!
GID00051428	With this weapon, your "unarmed" attacks will have the ferocity and armor-shredding power of the Deathclaws. Assuming you can survive long enough to take one of their hands, of course.
GID00051429	Bannon: Still suffering from his "social problem." Keep on penicillin, and try to convince him to watch out in the future.
GID00051430	Brock: Another day, another broken nose. Rare to see him as a patient, but at least the people he "refers" are still alive. Barely.
GID00051431	Cantelli, Paulie: Treatment for the steady stream of his addictions would be a steady income, but I can't waste the resources on him if he's just going to get hooked again.
GID00051432	Holmes, Seagrave: Chronic case of red-lung from all his repairs below-decks. Prescribed a few hours of fresh air up top every night.
GID00051433	Staley, Gary: Exhaustion. The man really needs to take a rest at some point. But then again, who doesn't?
GID00051434	Trinnie: Surprisingly healthy, apart from the alcoholism and other chronic dangers of her line of work. Guess they grow them strong in Lamplight.
GID00051435	Marcus and the others left today. Finally, we have the whole place to ourselves! No more listening to lectures about what we can and can't say on the air. The airwaves will be free!
GID00051436	Now Rhonda and I can host our own radio show like we've been planning. I don't know why Marcus always refused to let us do it before. He always started getting real nervous when I told him what Rhonda thought about things. Rhonda says he was afraid she was too smart to control.
GID00051437	Anyway, this is the start of a new era! The only downside is most of the dumb dumbs chose to stay.
GID00051438	Apart from the standard dangers, Rivet City provides a few uncommon problems for long-time residents:
GID00051439	* Lockjaw: Muscle spasms, especially of the jaw, from getting cuts on the rusty ship hull. Treat with penicillin, when available.
GID00051440	* Red-lung: Respiratory problems from regularly inhaling rust particles - particularly a problem for hangar deck residents and shut-ins. Treat with steam therapy and time outside to flush system.
GID00051441	* Fish poisoning: Less of a problem nowadays, but occasionally someone finds a fish in the river and is dumb enough to try to eat the thing. Radiation levels spike and mercury poisoning drives most victims crazy. No cure, but at least people nearby get a reminder not to do it.

GID00051478	I suppose it seems only right to say goodbye. I ought to know it's hopeless, but maybe one of my sisters is still out there, and I couldn't go without leaving some kind of farewell. Just know that I did everything I could. I tried, and I only wish that I could be the last to go, so I could have helped all the others before they met their own end.
GID00051479	These days I feel like more of a preacher than a nurse. We've lost hope that the reservists will be back. I can only hope they died with some scrap of honor and didn't abandon us. Without medication, people are succumbing to radiation sickness, for which there is no hope of treatment. We can do nothing more than make our patients comfortable as we await the end. When the painkillers and whiskey run out, prayer is all we can offer them. I've taken to wearing a headwrap; I don't want them to see how much of my own hair has fallen out.
GID00051480	We're low on Prussian Blue. Most of them don't know what that really means, for which I'm thankful. One of the local doctors in our camp knows about a cancer treatment facility not too far from here. We're sending some of the guardsmen out to investigate. If they can recover any filgrastim, we might be able to stave off widespread radiation sickness a little longer.
GID00051481	I took the NCO's advice and set up a quarantine for the worst of the radiation victims. We know better than to think they're contagious, but most of our survivors don't, and it helps keep them calm. We also have an easier time smuggling the bodies out at night. It's not so much that people die; it's how they look when they go. They all think they'll just lose a bit of hair, maybe get a rash. It gets so much worse than that.
GID00051482	Dolores and Rebecca deserted in the night. They had the goodness not to rob us blind on her way out; I had trusted Becky with the keys to the canteen and the artesian well we locked up on Day One.. Several of our survivors were talking rubbish about seeking refuge in a nearby Vault, the girls must have decided to go with them. Damned fools; if anybody made it into those things in time, they bloody well aren't letting any of us in now. I suppose I should just be glad we have a few less mouths to feed.
GID00051483	The others keep telling me not to worry, but I feel it sometimes; I think there's something in here with us. I can always hear weird noises coming from above my room.
GID00051484	Our unit has been assigned to a National Guard Detachment. They drove all night from Pennsylvania. We're doing our best to keep the survivors placated while these boys get their strength up. The looting gets worse every day, and it's a small town. There can't be much left, and there's already been one scuffle at the canteen. These Guardsmen arrived just in time, I fear.

GID00051492	Rhonda made me angry so I threw this. Now it doesn't seem to work.
GID00051493	Please fix.
GID00051494	Jack at Nellis is looking for scrap metal. He can't pay me, but earning the trust of people with that much artillery seems like a decent idea.
GID00051495	James,
GID00051496	You and I served together for seven years, and I'm calling in a favor. I need you to convince General Oliver to stop transferring my men out of here and to deliver the replacements I was promised. I'm expected to put these prisoners to work making new rail lines and fixing the existing ones, but I can't do that if I don't have any guards to keep an eye on them. Does the general really expect the handful of men I have left to be able to keep several dozen hardened men in line?
GID00051497	You owe me for that one time in Modoc. Don't let me down.
GID00051498	Nathan
GID00051499	The Fiends have been more active outside New Vegas. The NCR troops stationed at Camp McCarran are handling this for now, but the situation needs to be monitored.
GID00051500	Something's going on, and I'm sure that Cooke is behind it all. No evidence yet, but something just feels... off.
GID00051501	About Cooke. He's quite popular among the younger prisoners, and many of them seem to have been taken in by his anti-NCR dogma. Cooke's group are all model prisoners, especially Cooke himself. They don't fight and they always do what they're told. They make me nervous, and I'd have them watched every second of every day if I could.
GID00051502	Dad just won't listen to a word I say.
GID00051503	He keeps leaving the bunker to salvage supplies from the rest of the base. In understand he's bored, cooped up in here, but so are the rest of us.
GID00051504	And the bunker is secure! Every time he leaves, he exposes all of us to that damned radiation.
GID00051505	After all the effort it took to get us all in here, dad's willing to throw it all away just because he's a bit ansty.
GID00051506	I really hate him sometimes.
GID00051507	Our farms on the east side of New Vegas are producing a good amount of crops. With the additional water allocated from Hoover Dam, we can increase the number of farms over the next few years by a substantial amount. That means more residents inclined to vote for annexation.
GID00051508	I've seen the reports of this so-called "Caesar's Legion". It sounds like they're just another bunch of raiders, but the higher-ups back west seem to think they're a serious threat.
GID00051509	Reports are coming in from Freeside detailing a rise in violence against NCR Citizens. We're going to need to look into this. All sources indicate that Pacer is involved, of course.
GID00051510	They're transferring away three more of my men. They tell me it's all to keep the situation at the Dam under control, but what about this place? The situation here has become dangerous for my men and I - I know it, my men know it, and the prisoners know it. It's only a matter of time before something happens.
GID00051511	Latest information from our inside source reports that the Omertas are unhappy with House. We may be able to use this as leverage against him.
GID00051512	Private Morales has asked me to find and retrieve the corpse of her dead husband. His body is apparently being used as a lure to draw in NCR troops and slaughter them. Better keep a look out for traps and snipers...
GID00051513	The body is just east of Repconn HQ and I should carry it to the troopers camped out on the north side of the railroad tracks.

GID00051516	... population continues to grow unhindered. With the overcrowding came violence, it was nothing at first, but quickly escalated with the open access to firearms in the armory. The armory door was not, at the time, connected to the main system and could not be locked; so I placed guards at the armory door to prevent some of the more troublesome residents from obtaining weapons. There was some opposition to this, but the majority of the residents seemed to agree...

GID00051548	The insect colloquially known as the Radroach is one of the most ubiquitous denizens of the modern American landscape. I believe it to be of the species P. Americana, the American cockroach, albeit a genome strain affected by years of exposure to heavy radiation levels. While winged, they are incapable of flight. I theorize that this is due to the evolutionary failure of the wing appendages to grow in strength commensurate to the surge in body mass. Radroach wings still seem to serve some purpose, however, in inter-species communication. Dark, damp, irradiated habitats, such as the metro tunnels, provide an ideal environment for breeding. Caution should be taken while exploring such areas, but the threat to operatives is minimal, even in great numbers.

GID00051565	BYOB.
GID00051566	BUILDING A DECK
GID00051567	Caravan decks are comprised of at least 30 cards from one or more traditional playing card sets. The deck may have any number of cards of any type that suits a player's strategy, although it cannot have duplicate cards from the same set. For example, a King of Spades from Set A and a King of Spades from the Set B deck is acceptable, but more than one King of Spades from Set A would be illegal.
GID00051568	RULES
GID00051569	Caravan is played with two players building three opposing piles (or "caravans") of numbered cards. The goal is to outbid your opponent's caravan with the highest value of numbered cards without being too light (under 21) or overburdened (over 26).
GID00051570	The game begins with each player taking eight cards from their deck and placing either one numerical card or ace on each caravan. Players may not discard during this initial round.
GID00051571	Once both players have started their three caravans, each player may do ONE of the following on their turn:
GID00051572	1. Play one card and draw a new card from his or her deck to their hand.
GID00051573	2. Discard one card from their hand and draw a new card from his or her deck.
GID00051574	3. Disband one of their three caravans by removing all cards from that pile.
GID00051575	Caravans have a direction, either ascending or descending numerically, and a suit. The suit is determined with the first card placed on a caravan, the direction by the second. All subsequent cards must continue the numerical direction or match the suit of the previous card. Cards of the same numerical value cannot be played in sequence, regardless of suit. Face cards can be attached to numeric cards in any caravan and affects them in various ways.
GID00051576	CARD VALUES
GID00051577	Joker: Played against ace, 2-10. Effects change based on whether it's an ace or a numbered card (see below). Multiple jokers may be played on the same card.
GID00051578	Ace: Value of 1. Jokers played on aces remove all other non-face cards of the ace's suit from the table. E.g. a joker played on an Ace of Spades removes all spades (except face cards and that card, specifically) from the table.
GID00051579	2-10: Listed value. Jokers played on these cards remove all other cards of this value from the table. E.g. a joker played on a 4 of Hearts removes all 4s (other than that card, specifically) from the table.
GID00051580	Jack: Played against ace, 2-10. Removes that card, along with any face cards attached to it.
GID00051581	Queen: Played against ace, 2-10. Reverses the current direction of the hand and changes the current suit of the hand. Multiple queens may be played on the same card.
GID00051582	King: Played against ace, 2-10. Adds the value of that card again. E.g. a king played on a 9 adds 9 to that hand. Multiple kings may be played on the same card for multiplicative effects. E.g. 4+ king = 8. 4 + 2 kings = 16.
GID00051583	WINNING
GID00051584	A player's caravan is considered sold when the value of its cards is over 20 and under 27. The other player may still outbid by increasing the value of their opposing pile while staying within the 21-26 range. When each of the three competing caravans has sold, the game is over. In the event that one of the three caravan values are tied between players, the game continues until all three caravans have sold. The player with two or more sales wins the pot.

GID00051589	Species: Beauveria Mordicana
GID00051590	An entomopathogenic fungus, B. Mordicana has been developed to colonize the bodies of most common pests. Once it has fully colonized a host body, the host technically dies, but the body continues to move by means of the fungal colony within it. In this manner the fungus moves amongst more of its prey, occasionally spraying spores in a radius around the host body, infecting all who come near it. Its drawbacks include the time it takes to kill prey (10-20 days) and its limited effectiveness when dealing with unsocial pests.

GID00051592	To: Johnson, Samuel
GID00051593	Mr. Johnson,
GID00051594	I would like to remind you that company policy forbids any form of harassment between employees, sexual or otherwise.
GID00051596	This statement is not only offensive and inappropriate, but could be considered a misuse of company-issued grenades (see Form B43).
GID00051597	Species: Mantis Religiosa
GID00051598	Of all the species we brought with us, the common mantis exceeds the rest in terms of predation. The insects are voracious, and their camouflage allows them to attack prey by surprise. Also, they complement our botanical specimens by hunting down those pests that avoid or escape our other measures. Lastly, mantises will begin to cannibalize one another when other food is scarce, making their numbers self-regulating when prey is scarce.

GID00051602	Yvette, the leader of the Scorpions on the Westside of New Vegas, wants you to set up a steady supply of ammunition from the NCR quartermaster at Camp McCarran. Her gang recently acquired new firearms but lack the ammunition to put them to use.
GID00051603	Species: BE908
GID00051604	A distant relative of the more commonly known venus fly trap, species BE908 seems to be performing well. The plants are a threat to creatures up to five times their size due to the violent nature of their closing maws. Those that aren't swallowed whole are often incapacitated by their initial "bite". The plants' lack of mobility is offset by their ability to lure prey into reach by means of a nectar they secrete from their bodies.
GID00051612	When you draw your sword, Grelok lowers his great horned head and bellows laughter in your face. You grit your teeth and swing a mighty two-handed blow, the magical blade ringing clearly, even amid the tumult of throaty cackling.
GID00051613	You swing the sword so fiercely, it escapes your grip and hurtles into the open maw of the monstrosity, lost from sight in the arid darkness of Grelok's throat. You step back as Grelok jerks his mouth shut and stands upright. He is still for a moment, then starts clawing at his neck. Muffled, a ringing can be heard as if from a great distance.
GID00051614	Suddenly, Grelok's chest bursts in a fount of viscous, green blood. The Ringing can be heard clearly now, and as thick lifeblood oozes around the protruding tip of the magic sword, the stormclouds swirling the peak are already clearing. Grelok is defeated!
GID00051615	THE END
GID00051616	(Thanks for playing!)
GID00051617	Here's what I need you to research.
GID00051618	1) Several casualty reports have come in saying that Alpha Station sustained heavy casualties and injuries in the vicinity of Hoover Dam - yet no new reinforcements have been sent in weeks. Speak with Senior Ranger Rebecca Lineholm, get an accurate casualty count and asses the situation, as several of us have been worried that something horrible is stalking the Hoover Dam area if it can claim NCR's elite Rangers.
GID00051619	2) Ranger Station Bravo hasn't requested a resupply in four months. While the Rangers I can reach on the radio say things are 'just fine' I need you to speak to Ranger Ericsen, the commanding officer, and find out how they've been running on no supplies for so long.
GID00051620	3) Delta station radioed in a report of an NCR Trooper cadre being murdered to the last man in a horrifying display of brutality. The report mentioned a squad of Super mutants wearing Caesar's colors. This report has unsettled NCR command I need you to speak to Senior Ranger Pason to confirm the report and get an accurate count of Super mutants spotted.
GID00051621	4) Echo Station has had a five-fold spike in reported enemy contacts, but NCR crews dispatched to follow up have a mere 10% success rate in intercepting these hostiles. The ghouls I've reached by the radio insist everything is 'just fine' but the numbers disagree - so speak Senior Ranger Erasmus for me please. Perhaps they're short-handed and need more spotters.
GID00051622	5) Foxtrot station called in a report of an NCR Trooper patrol slaughtered by a Great Khan hunting team with trained Deathclaws. Senior Ranger Kudlow called in the report but I can't seem to contact her for a more detailed account of the incident - please to speak to her and confirm/deny this rather disturbing report.
GID00051623	Mei Wong is afraid of a man named Sister in Rivet City who she thinks is a slaver.
GID00051624	Remember those suits I told you about? Gone. Some jackass ordered a complete reorganization of our storage system and now I can't find anything. Wonderful. I guess they'll turn up sooner or later.
GID00051625	Johnson, I've come across a crate with a couple of suits made of a material I don't even recognize. Do you know what the hell this is? Looks like pre-war tech to me. The eggheads we have down here are mostly glorified mechanics, so they just scratched their heads when I showed it to them.
GID00051626	The priest is drinking water, poring over a thick, leatherbound volume connected by a thick leather thong to his neck. He notices you only when you've come very close.
GID00051627	"Ah, good friend! Have you gone ahead to open the chapel? My body still aches with drink, I'm afraid, but soon I will gather the congregation and return myself."
GID00051628	I found some notes Aurelius wrote detailing troop numbers in the area, lists of slaves sent east, and general communications with Caesar.
GID00051629	We've begun to take stock of what's left here, but my first impression is "not much." The equipment here is in terrible condition, and will require extensive repairs to get even minimal power production started. Looks like we've got our work cut out for us, boys.
GID00051630	The priest drunkenly curses the undead who have defiled his church. You present him with the decapitated zombie head from your bag.
GID00051631	"Praise you!", he hiccups. "Perhaps Grelok's influence isn't so strong!". With that, he turns his decanter over on the head and tosses into a fireplace, where it bursts into purple flame and burns up almost instantly.
GID00051632	"I must gather the faithful." He presses a brass key into your palm, "Please, help yourself to what little may be of use at my chapel."
GID00051633	The priest notices your approach and looks up from his swilling.
GID00051634	"Grelok is come, and we are forsaken!", he cries. "Urp!", he continues.
GID00051636	"If you could rid the place of the zombies", he tells you, "I'll give you the key, and you can help yourself to the apothecary"

GID00051640	This place is a mess. Most of the old hiking trails are buried in landslides, and the rest is so dusted you can't tell which direction you're supposed to go. I don't know what the hell the survey team was thinking when they said this was a strategically sound location. At least we were issued plenty of rations and the river has plenty of fresh water. We could eat for months. Let's hope tomorrow brings some headway cleaning this place up.
GID00051641	I've found it possible to create a sort of makeshift weapon using all of the dog tags I've been collecting over the past month. One of these days the NCR is going to pay for their continual mismanagement and idiotic bravado.

No one knows what it is going to be like out there. There could be horrific mutants, or strange wandering vagabonds, aliens, murderous gangs. WE have no idea. Let's be smart about this.

GID00051696	Your birthday is tomorrow, sweet 16 at last! Can you even believe it? It seems like yesterday my sister told me she was going to have a little girl. Do you have big plans for your birthday? I think if you are interested, I could talk to some folks and get the dining room reserved for a couple hours.

GID00051718	I've been getting headaches; I think someone is poisoning us. I've been up every night this week, and night after night, an extra boost of air comes through the vents, it lasts for about five minutes, and then turns off. I spoke with one of the neighbors; he said he noticed the same thing in his room as well. We made a report the maintenance officer; he informed us that the system was running perfectly and that there was nothing to worry about, I don't believe him, maybe he's in on it.
GID00051719	I couldn't sleep a few nights ago, so I stayed up reading, around 1:30 in the morning the vent above my bed began to push out more air than usual; it lasted for about five minutes then turned off. I did not think much of it at the time, but I had trouble falling asleep again last night; once again around 1:30 AM the vents turned on for about five minutes then turned off.
GID00051720	The radio station is fixed, and we've begun sending our message out into the desert. Marcus thinks I spend too much time in here, but what does a first gen know? Rhonda says they're just one step up from dumb dumbs, and I agree.
GID00051721	I don't know how much longer I can hold on. I'm pretty sure I broke my leg about two miles back, and now I can barely limp forward. So here I sit, writing this stupid journal.
GID00051722	Oh, and someone's been tracking me. They've been watching me for about an hour now. I'm hoping they're friendly. Guess I'll find out soon enough.
GID00051723	We've been picking up a lot of activity from China's satellite network. The tension is pretty high around here. Frank's been talking about securing a place in one of those vaults for himself and his family, and when he didn't show up to work yesterday, I think we all knew where he went.

GID00051763	I wish to speak with you immediately in regards to important matters.
GID00051764	I trust you have learned enough in your travels to know that the New California Republic is an honorable nation engaged in a beneficent mission in the Mojave in general and New Vegas in particular. It is in addition a wealthy nation that well rewards persons who dedicate themselves to its national interests, whether for reasons patriotic or material.
GID00051765	Allow me to reassure you that if you have committed any crimes or misdemeanors against the republic, it is in my power to pardon misconduct of this sort.
GID00051766	I stand ready to receive you at your earliest convenience in my offices at the New California Republic Embassy at the south side of the Vegas Strip.

GID00051773	These past few years, the very idea of "fine dining" has seemed beyond our grasp; indeed, where does one even begin to look for something artfully prepared and beautifully presented by a world-class chef? Well, fellow epicures, I have found the on place left on this Godforsaken earth with Real Food.
GID00051774	I present to you the Ultra-Luxe.
GID00051775	Ignore the rabble on the street, the petty farmers and everyman-types rubbing their pitiful few caps together in an attempt to elevate themselves to some semblance of class. Ignore the filthy, disease-ridden prostitutes of the Gomorrah, whoring themselves to anyone with coin. Walk briskly to the fabulous Ultra-Luxe, the only building in New Vegas worth your attention (you'll know it when you see it). Enter the doors of their restaurant, the Gourmand, and speak with the lovely Marjorie - she'll arrange for your care.
GID00051776	Dally not, for reservations must be made as early as possible. A sumptuous feast awaits you, dear friends.
GID00051777	"Can I Tell Him?" A Poseidon Energy Publication for New Employees
GID00051778	As a member of the Poseidon Family, it will be natural for you to become enthusiastic about the incredible endeavors you'll be undertaking with us, and to want to tell others. But just a second there, my good man! Let's take a minute to consider what could happen if company information fell into the wrong hands, and whose hands those might be.
GID00051779	"Can I tell my wife?" Well, let's say you do. You tell her not to tell anyone. Your bond is sacred. But a woman's idle tongue is the devil's plaything. No sooner do you leave for work the next day than she's on the phone telling her best friend Candy. Then Candy tells Gertie, Gertie tells Maxine, Maxine tells Lulu, and while Lulu is telling Doris, a Chinese agent posing as an American operator listens in, and the next thing she's on the line with the Forbidden City, singing like a treasonous canary. The following day you and your wife are bound in shackles and China is sitting at the controls of our entire arsenal.
GID00051780	"Can I tell my children?" What father wouldn't want his kids to look up to him? Don't be that father. One day at school, Ivan Bullykov will get more than lunch money out of your kids. He'll have national secrets! And while they're parading him through Red Square as a national hero, your children will be working in forced labor camps, right next to you and your beautiful young wife, who's now wrinkled and homely since the communists have banned makeup because it expresses individuality.
GID00051781	"Can I tell my drinking buddies?" Surely if there's somewhere safe a man can place his trust, it is with his other male friends. But how much do you really know about them? Are they friends... or *comrades*? Don't be too sure. Even the most transparent window can hide secrets when it's lined with Iron Curtains.
GID00051782	Always remember: you are a member of two families now. And you have obligations to both. But your obligation to the Poseidon Family is greater, because while your children may misbehave and your friends may change and your wife may nag and cheat on you, Poseidon Energy will always be paying for and protecting your way of life. Don't tell anybody about anything about the projects of Poseidon Energy. When pressed, tell them that your job is repetitive and not worth discussing, but the Company is nurturing and gives good benefits and is always looking for new talent.

GID00051818	Robert Edwin House, 261, President, CEO, and sole proprietor of the New Vegas Strip, industrialist and technologist, founder, President, and CEO of the multi-billion-dollar pre-war robotics and software corporation, RobCo Industries, has died.
GID00051819	Generally recognized by Mr. House to be mankind's only hope of long-term survival, Mr. House's passing may well sound a death knell for the entire human race.
GID00051820	Lost forever is his bounty of knowledge concerning human longevity, the depth and breadth of which could, as he was apt to say, "fill several text books." He was not exaggerating. Though he did not achieve his goal of functional immortality, let us not forget that he died at the age of 261. How many people do that? I mean, come on.
GID00051821	Also lost forever are House's singular personality, force of will, vision, and leadership ability. The probability of an equally capable figure emerging from the current human population to lead mankind to a future of equivalent quality is less than 0.000112% by objective measures too complex to detail in this obituary.
GID00051822	Personality and force of will: Born June 25th, 2020, House was orphaned at an early age when his parents died in a freak accident (auto gyro, lightning). Though cheated of his inheritance, House attended the prestigious Institute in Massachusetts and founded RobCo Industries on his 22nd birthday. Within five years, it was one of the most profitable corporations on Earth.
GID00051823	Vision: By 2065, House was certain that an atomic war would soon devastate the planet. At great personal expense, he developed technologies to ensure the structural integrity of the city of Las Vegas (as it was known at the time). On the day of the great war, 77 atomic warheads targeted the city. Mr. House defeated them all. Talk about vision!
GID00051824	Leadership: Mr. House survived the war, of course, and would later recruit the Three Families, negotiate the Treaty of New Vegas, and rebuild the Vegas Strip. While these achievements yielded many immediate benefits, they were all part of House's master plan to re-ignite mankind's quest for technological advancement, a plan without which the human race has nowhere to go, and nowhere to turn.

GID00051906	Have I told you lately that you're my favorite person? You are!
GID00051907	The reason I gave you this print-out is I wanted to remind you about that bunker Mr. House built over at Fortification Hill. I was going to say something out loud, but then I felt self-conscious, because I feel really ANNOYING when I repeat myself!
GID00051908	Just to clarify - anytime YOU want to repeat yourself, go right ahead! It's only a problem when I do it!
GID00051909	Anyway, now that you've installed me on the Lucky 38's mainframe, I can peek into Mr. House's data. And guess what? The underground facility over at the Fort is super-important!
GID00051910	What Mr. House did over there was stash a HUGE number of Securitrons. Hundreds of them!
GID00051911	Imagine how powerful they'd be if you upgraded them with the Mark II OS!
GID00051912	When the Legion attacks Hoover Dam, you could sic your army on them! And who deserves to have an army more than you? No one!
GID00051913	Plus an army of upgraded Securitrons would be just the thing to show the NCR that you mean business! Go away and stay away, NCR!
GID00051914	The thing is - and I really HATE admitting this - I can't upgrade the Securitrons over at the Fort from here in the Lucky 38... I can't establish a reliable connection, and I'm sure it's all my fault somehow.
GID00051915	But if you took the Platinum Chip to the Fort, you could perform the upgrade yourself. Just a suggestion!

GID00051965	The brain structure of a Feral Necrotic Post-Human indicates that the regenerative ability of the neurological systems that affords typical Necrotic Post-Humans their longevity does not extend into the higher reasoning functions of the brain itself. This is a condition that I refer to as Ferocious Post-Necrotic Dystrophy.
GID00051966	As the reasoning and high order thinking portions of the brain deteriorate, the Post-Human subject becomes increasingly hostile, giving into a carnal need to feed as opposed to the capacity for thinking that reasoning that a typical Necrotic Post-Human retains. It remains unclear exactly what precipitates this change in biology and psychology, but anecdotal evidence seems to indicate that non-social ghouls, or those in isolation, are more prone to the condition.
GID00051967	The brain structure of a Luminous Necrotic Post-Human (colloquially referred to as a "Glowing One") indicates that the regenerative ability of the neurological systems that affords typical Necrotic Post-Humans their longevity, does not extend into the higher reasoning functions of the brain itself. (This subject is further covered in report on the dissection of Feral Necrotic Post-Humans)
GID00051968	The distinctive luminescence that is the trademark of the Glowing One can be best attributed to an unusual amount of radioactive chemicals that building up in the bloodstream and muscle tissue of a typical Ghoul. Upon the transformation into a Feral Ghoul, the neurological systems of the body cease filtering these particles from the blood and tissue, instead causing them to build a distinctive bioluminescence that is distinctive of the "Glowing Ones".
GID00051969	Their social structure seems to be different from that of the Feral Ghoul. They actively seek out others of both their strain and those afflicted with Ferocious Post-Necrotic Dystrophy, particularly those who may have been injured. Studies on the nature of their healing effects on other ghouls continues with no conclusive results as of yet.

GID00052003	Now that things have been set in motion, I am going to be your liaison and point of contact with RobCo. I'll be handling anything that arises during your transition to the RobCo family. My first priority is going to be tightening up your security. As you well know, RobCo handles many classified projects. Because of this, REPCONN will need a large increase to security. I'll be sending over some engineers and security personnel to discreetly install some enhanced security procedures. Most of it will be pretty innocuous, however all employees will be required to wear their security badges at all times.
GID00052004	Please have your people start wearing their badges well in advance of our partnership becoming official. I think it will make the transition easier. None of the security measures will be activated until I arrive on site. Hopefully by then everyone will be comfortable with the new rules.

I've been following a strict patrol schedule since the incident, making sure to cover the roads leading into Camp Searchlight. I like to keep myself moving in order to catch any wayward travelers who may not know the dangers that now lurk within the town. I don't think I could forgive myself if someone got past me and went into that hell hole of a place. So far I've been able to maintain enough energy that I'm never away from any point on my patrol for long. I wonder how long before I can't keep going anymore?
GID00052041	Frank Weathers asked me to find his family. He thinks they may be enslaved in Cottonwood Cove by the Legion.

GID00052043	Not many patrols out here lately, which means not much loot. Our crew is thinking we should make a move soon. Follow the tracks up north; head towards the Strip. You in? Ain't on the chain gang anymore, but we still gotta stick together.

GID00052050	You were right. Leo sent me a message last night. I've made the call to the board. I think with the numbers we are looking at pocketing from the RobCo deal we will have no trouble getting the board to vote no confidence on him.

GID00052055	I'd stand with you Leo. Give me a few days to try and gather some support from my allies on the board. I've run the numbers, and I'm pretty sure you are right. We can fight this.

GID00052057	You've turned us down twice now, Holmes. This is my last appeal. We used to be friends. We used to do business together. All I want is to sell our product in Rivet City. I'm sure the city could use slaves to help with the rebuilding. Paradise Falls has slaves to sell, at a good price. You used to sell me wastelanders you captured, before you got all full of yourself. You aren't as pure as you pretend. Help me and we can both make a nice profit.

GID00052062	Julia,
GID00052063	I am sure you have heard by now about RobCo's intentions to buy out our company. In the past you and I have been of like mind when it comes to the moral and financial future of this company. When Poseidon showed interest those years ago, you helped me rally the board in order to keep REPCONN autonomous. I'd like your help again with RobCo.
GID00052064	Piers claims that RobCo is buying shares in the company to force a hostile take-over if we won't sell willingly. I don't believe that they will be able to pull together enough shares without some approval of the board. I think that you and I will be able to sway enough votes to keep the company safe. I hope you will stand with me for this.

GID00052069	More complaints of strange noises by Jackson. I'm starting to think he still has some unresolved issues after seeing his last squad wiped out by a Legion slaver squad to the south. I sent out a few men to investigate, but they couldn't find anything. I think should keep Jackson away from the munitions until he calms down.

GID00052073	Hi RobCo Supply:
GID00052074	We are sending back two (2) crates of devices labeled "StealthBoys" back to you. According to the manifest, each crate contained one gross (144) of the devices. As a result of employee misbehavior (not mine!), one crate was opened and is missing five (5) StealthBoys. Sorry about that.
GID00052075	Sincerely,

GID00052097	Dear RobCo Supply:
GID00052098	First off let me say that everyone here is really excited about the merger. It's super to be part of a company as exciting as RobCo!
GID00052099	Have we got some kinks in the supply chain? Yesterday a bunch of crates got delivered here containing two gross of devices called "StealthBoys." Is it okay if I ask what these things are? Do they really make you invisible? That sounds wild. What will RobCo think of next?
GID00052100	Let me know if the shipment came here by mistake. No problem if it didn't - I bet you can have a lot of fun with these things!
GID00052101	Thanks,

GID00052105	Excerpt from the deposition of the defendant Katherine Stone by Vault Attorney Gerard Miles
GID00052106	Q. Okay, let's pick up where we left off, Kate.
GID00052107	A. Katherine.
GID00052108	Q. Sorry, right. Katherine. I keep forgetting.
GID00052109	A. My husband calls me Kate.
GID00052110	Q. You were telling us of a discussion you allegedly had with Roy Gottlieb of the Justice Bloc.
GID00052111	A. Not allegedly. Had. We've been through this.
GID00052112	Q. It's still just your word against his, Ms. Stone. But please, the discussion.
GID00052113	A. [Sighs] He said my husband's name had come up in their meetings.
GID00052114	Q. The candidate endorsement meetings?
GID00052115	A. Yes. They were going to endorse him. He wouldn't say why, but I know my husband had a regular poker game with some of them, and he'd been on a winning streak lately.
GID00052116	Q. And according to you, what did Mr. Gottlieb offer?
GID00052117	A. He said he could sway his bloc. Prevent the endorsement. But only if I...
GID00052118	Q. Only if you what, Katherine?
GID00052119	A. Only if I...
GID00052120	Q. Only if you performed sexual favors.
GID00052121	A. Yes.
GID00052122	Q. Was this just for Mr. Gottlieb?
GID00052123	A. No. All the bloc leadership. Their friends.
GID00052124	Q. And you agreed.
GID00052125	A. What else could I do? They had a majority.
GID00052126	Q. How long did this go on before the endorsements came out?
GID00052127	A. I don't know. A month, maybe.
GID00052128	Q. And when they came out, and your husband was endorsed despite your supposed agreement, was that when you decided to kill members of the bloc?
GID00052129	A. Yes. I thought, their majority is pretty slim. If I thinned things out a little, especially in the leadership, someone else might get elected.
GID00052130	Q. Assuming you weren't caught.
GID00052131	A. No, Mr. Miles. I expected to be caught. That was my best chance. Now they'll elect me.
GID00052132	Q. A confessed murderer? You think voters would be willing to risk putting you in charge?
GID00052133	A. They have to pick somebody and live with their reasons.
GID00052134	Q. Yes, but-
GID00052135	A. Wait and see.

GID00052137	Prepared Speech of Gus Olson, Ombudsman, for the Annual Overseer Election
GID00052138	Good afternoon. Each year it is the appointed task of the ombudsman not only to officiate the election, but to chronicle it in hopes that after the last overseer has finished his term and walked to his death in the chamber beneath his office, and the vault has become still, that one day some excavator from humanity or perhaps some yet-unknown race of super beings might find our records and incorporate them into historical canon.
GID00052139	But lately it's occurred to me that that's not really why. I think the real reason we do it is because we want to believe that somewhere in the archives there's an answer to all of this, or perhaps there will be one when the historical records are completed and the whole story is told. We want it to make sense. To understand why the vault's mainframe will kill us if we do not offer one of our own as a yearly sacrifice. To fully comprehend why we continue to have these elections despite the unfettered corruption that has plagued it for what must be decades by now. There was a simpler time when elections meant shaking hands and kissing babies. But now with the rise of the voting blocs and this infestation of bribery, drug trafficking, smuggling, and God knows what else, we want to know why.
GID00052140	Well I've been through the archives, and I can tell you you won't find the answer there. You'll find an account of the first overseer, who entered the vault as the only citizen aware of the sacrifices that would have to take place. But he didn't have the answers either. If he did, surely he would've foreseen the citizens' anger when he broke the news. Surely he would've guessed that they would want to choose a sacrifice democratically, in the way that we citizens are accustomed to washing our hands of terrible deeds, and that his name would be at the top of the polls, and that the simultaneous vacancy of overseer and martyr would forever fuse the two positions here in Vault 11. But he didn't. He had the answers no more than any of us, and the records state that after the citizens discovered that the sacrificial chamber's password was his wife Betty's first name, and its door was unsealed so he could be offered as the first sacrifice, he walked down into that room crying like a child.
GID00052141	I can only wonder if there are no answers to be found, and we are just going along with this because we don't see another choice. Nevertheless, I still hold onto hope that we can find one. I urge you all to take the journey I took - to remember that it wasn't so long ago that we were ruled by our civility and our dignity, and that those were times when we didn't have to be quite so ashamed. Thank you.
GID00052142	Day 75:
GID00052144	Dusty McBride wants you to look into the nightly shootings of his livestock, which he says tend to occur around midnight. Being at the brahmin pen at that time would seem to be the best way to catch the culprit.

GID00052178	Day 4: Suit passed first test with flying (yellow) colors. Overnight visit to Yucca Mountain. Didn't go too deep because something big moving around further down tunnel. Rad level high even where I was, and I didn't feel a tickle. Go, rad suit, go!
GID00052179	Day 5: Vomited all morning. Didn't splash on suit or I'd be pissed. Must be something I ate.
GID00052180	Day 9: Exciting! Ran across old woman's scrap yard. Bought glowing container for measly 50 caps. Heading for Clark Field to prove suit at higher rad levels. If it holds up, I'm going to pop this jar of goop open and pour it all over me! I bet I could swim in this stuff if I had enough of it! Oh yeah!

GID00052243	Going to be a little different than the one I kept for hauling scrap ha ha. But Ive always been a strong believer in keeping straight books.
GID00052244	TO MOTOR RUNNER:
GID00052245	Teen girl - 500 caps
GID00052246	Adult man, 38 - 0 caps
GID00052247	True to his word paid top money for the girl. Plus bonus for first delivery. But paid nothing for girls father who took a swing at him when untide. Got to keep em more secured. Also keep SJ off the girls as even fiends dont want used goods.
GID00052248	TO MOTOR RUNNER:
GID00052249	Adult woman (28) - 250 caps
GID00052250	Old woman - 25 caps
GID00052251	Old man - 25 caps
GID00052252	Baby (boy?) - 0 caps
GID00052253	Got to be more careful selecting what we deliver. Runner liked the woman of course but the babys worthless except to make sure the woman does as shes told. Her parents next to worthless. Shouldve killed and left them. On the bright side Runner says we can start dealing with fiends closer by so no more dragging folks all the way to vault three.
GID00052254	TO NEPHI:
GID00052255	Teen girl - 400 caps
GID00052256	Teen boy - 150 caps
GID00052257	Child girl (7?) - 50 caps
GID00052258	More like it. Learned from past and got rid of mom and dad along the way. Tried to get more for the young one I said hey give her time to sprout. But Nephi wouldn't have it. Kept SJ off the girls so long as he got his damn teddy. Hes a sick one but I guess the work calls for it.
GID00052259	TO COOK COOK:
GID00052260	Adult woman - 200 caps
GID00052261	Teen girl - 400 caps
GID00052262	Teen girl - 400 caps
GID00052263	Teen boy - 100 caps
GID00052264	Did not like dealing with this cook cook. Didn't know if hed pay us or burn us. I guess what they do with them once they got them is up to them isnt my business but he didn't even wait for us to turn the corner before he was torching the boy and making the womenfolk watch. Lets hope to deal with Nephi next time.

GID00052342	Major,
GID00052343	You and I are well aware of the situation you're in, so I apologize in advance for the contents of this letter. Due to Camp Forlorn Hope's position as a high alert combat zone and the exceedingly high mortality rate of troopers assigned there, you are hereby ordered to pull all female NCR personnel (including non-combatants) from the field and give them marching orders to Camp McCarran for reassignment. Absolutely no female NCR personnel are to be stationed at Camp Forlorn Hope until further notification.
GID00052344	You will not be assigned replacements until High Command can figure out where the hell to pull replacements from.
GID00052345	You have my sympathies, Major.

GID00052382	Dear Ms. Van Graff,
GID00052383	It has come to my attention that Cassidy Caravans have suffered a number of setbacks recently. I can only hope that these latest unfortunate events drive that young booze-hound of an owner to finally sell me her remaining assets.

GID00052440	... fighting settled slightly following the announcement of the damage to the reactor before panic overtook the vault's residents. The technicians struggled to repair the damage to the reactor and main computer systems. We learned too late that as part of an automatic safety protocol the reactor had been reconfigured to use alternative pipe lines for its cooling systems, unfortunately with the damage to the mainframe the system was unable to detect the structural damage to the vault. Radioactive gasses pumped through the broken pipes and irradiated the vault. On top of it all, we cannot open the vault's main door. All systems appear to be on autopilot and manual override functions have been disabled. We'll just have to hope we can survive long enough for the door to open automatically...

GID00052473	After numerous attempts, I've found a range that highlights the particles in the air that I believe killed everyone in this vault. Preliminary tests show them to be spores of some kind. I've set up spectrometers on several of the levels now and the concentration appears to increase in the lower levels. At this point, I'm concerned that the plants here may constitute a danger to the people of the NCR.
GID00052474	I guess no one will miss this ridiculous trivia game. The questions weren't even that hard.
GID00052475	It looks like this is where most of the people were when they died. The medical reports I found suggested that most of them succumbed to some kind of airborne infection. I'm going to see if I can convert some of the growlamps into UV spectrometers to test the air for contaminants.

GID00052483	Chief Fire Officer Report No. F1-218
GID00052484	The local police department diverted several trucks from San Onofre carrying nuclear waste to Searchlight this morning. I didn't get all of the details but I heard something about bombs going off nearby and that the trucks were being diverted for safety reasons. Two of them were housed here at the Fire Station. The third had to continue on to somewhere else because we didn't have enough room to accommodate them all. For some odd reason it was headed toward Cottonwood Cove. I don't know what he's planning on doing with it down there.
GID00052485	This level appears to be where they performed most of the research NCR is interested in. I've been able to collect a little, but the vast majority of the data from the research done here is inaccessible. I'll have to find the main backup and download from there.
GID00052486	I've finally found some of the bodies of the scientists that lived here. They appear to be overgrown with some form of lichen. They blend in so well with the other growth that I walked right by several of them without even noticing them. I've taken the proper precautions, but the lichen doesn't seem to be contagious, at least to ghouls.
GID00052487	I've been hearing a strange chittering sound for some time now, and finally discovered its source. There's some kind of giant mantises that've taken up residence in the vault. I almost ran smack into one the other day, but the creatures don't appear to react to my presence at all. Perhaps the others sent here ran afoul of the creatures, but I can't see how a few scattered insects could pose much of a problem to experienced mercs.
GID00052488	It's strange, but some sections of the machinery down here appear to have been modified for some unknown purpose. The restraints regarding oxygen content and systemic pressure have been bypassed.
GID00052489	This level seems to have been devoted to the study of atmospheric effects on plants, with a concentration on producing plants with a high oxygen yield. Given the "problems" these vaults were known to have, it sounds like a reasonable avenue of research.
GID00052490	The goal of the Hidden Valley project is to create a self-sustaining shelter for high-ranking VIPs that can serve as a command structure in times of crisis. The bunker itself is located several hundred feet below the surface. Multiple layers of reinforced materials serve to prevent a breach of the inhabitable areas by anything save for a direct hit by a bunker-busting weapon utilizing a megatonnage considered outside the capability of America's closest competitors. In the event that our enemies become capable of such an attack, the bunker's DERVISH camouflaging system makes targeting the site impossible for automated systems, forcing aggressors to rely on guesswork and sheer luck.

From what I can tell they've managed to resolve the matter conversion issue you've been having with the Heisenberg Compensation field. Combined with the data from the sabotaged launch, I think you should have everything you need to complete the Q-35.

GID00052554	Further investigations into the U.F.O. codenamed "Palandine" have confirmed our suspicions.
GID00052555	On the evening of May 3, 2062, an alien craft of unknown make and origin did indeed breach the airspace just north of Hagerstown, Maryland and crashed into a heavily wooded, non-residential area.
GID00052556	Unfortunately, attempts to retrieve the craft proved unsuccessful. It simply could not be located, either due to some kind of advanced invisibility shielding, or because the occupants managed to make repairs and vacate the crash site before our arrival.
GID00052557	Despite our failure of recovery, the significance of this event cannot be denied.
GID00052558	We are not alone.
GID00052560	> Sir, I encountered three Ferals on my patrol. This was somewhere around 0300 hours, I think, and it was dark, so they saw me first. I discharged my firearm four times, fatally striking two of the three. My weapon jammed before I could fire on the third target, and just then I realized it wasn't engaging. I knew our orders were to report on anything unusual, and well -- I thought that was pretty strange. He actually followed me back here on his own. We put him in the trailer with the other and he's been quiet as you like. Strangest thing I've ever seen. >

Teams will be in charge of trading, inventory, politics, and miscellaneous. Many of you have asked why we don't have team dedicated to security. Well, I've talked long about this with George, and we both agree that we don't want to appear belligerent to the outside world. We are certain that once the people out there realize that we are just like them, and won't threaten them at all, they'll be happy to form long lasting relationships with us. We'd like to present an open hand instead of a closed fist.
GID00052596	Thank you!

GID00052598	What is with this guy? Well, honestly, I don't care. He buys up all my jet and keeps coming back for more. It doesn't really matter if he insists that he's a barber, I guess.

GID00052610	Hey, baby, I need to go have a chat with this farmer, Trent Bascom, over at the Sharecropper Farms about that water thing I've been boring you with. Hope I didn't wake you when I left. Back in awhile.

GID00052621	I can't say enough good things about this boy. The only thing is, I need to remember to keep an eye on him. I've caught him behind the counter several times. I'd say that he's more trouble that he's worth, but somehow, he just keeps coming up with caps for booze.
GID00052622	There's something up with her. She's become so mopey lately, I wish I knew what it was, she might be a good customer for the special stock. That is, if I could get her away from Greta long enough to work on her.
GID00052623	The system has detected moderate damage to the reactor. Please be advised of high radiation levels on the fourth floor.
GID00052624	Tried to escape today. Tabitha had one of her men beat me senseless when they caught me. Now they lock me up in the next room whenever I'm not working on something.
GID00052625	Oh, and I fixed a toaster.
GID00052626	I finally got Raul to finish installing the security measures on my door. Now I can have all the privacy I want.
GID00052627	Just in case I have a dumb dumb moment, I've placed the spare key under the stairs behind my building. No one ever goes back there, so it should be safe from discovery.
GID00052628	Pussycat -
GID00052629	Thanks for showing this cat the best hey-hey he's ever-ever! Talk about platinum in the sack, toots! Where'd you learn that 18 karat trick with the heels of your feet? You didn't just make my toes curl - they popped off and rolled under the bed!
GID00052630	I wish I could stay for another round, but this gent's got places to be, things to do. You showing up has forced my hand, baby! The time to act is now!
GID00052631	I won't be around for a while, but if everything works out right, you and me are a date, got it? Wouldn't miss it for all the caps in Vegas.
GID00052632	Now don't get clingy and try to follow me.

Until recently I was at RobCo, working in their security division, but now that your family and my family are one big family, we thought it would be nice if they sent an older sibling over. Now I'm going to do as much as I can not to interfere with your daily operations here, my principal concern is going to be security.
GID00052652	I hear that you all have been adapting well to some new security procedures. Well we've got some new kids to join your little family here. You'll see some friendly androids patrolling around the main building. As long as everyone remembers to wear their badges at all times and make sure they are properly registered with security, these friendly androids will stay out of your way. So as long as you all keep on as you have been, everything will be just fine.

These measures are in place for your safety as well as the safety and privacy of your REPCONN family. Along with the hardware and software security changes, each of you will also receive a personnel packet with a identification badge. It is very important that you wear your badge at all times.

GID00052696	Unfortunately, this means that we are going to have to start rationing our water. My apologies go out to anyone currently residing in one of the affected areas. We'll be working to resolve the issue as soon as possible.

GID00052722	Mr. Rook,
GID00052723	For the last couple weeks I have seen a higher than usual rate of encrypted messages leaving the facility here. These messages use an unusual encryption protocol that I haven't seen before, I'm fairly certain that it isn't a DoD approved method. I fear that these messages may be a sign of someone sending insider information.
GID00052724	Sara Wang
GID00052725	Ted,
GID00052728	I don't want any of these damn fools tripping over it, so I threw a couple of curves in, but it's nothing you can't handle. Start with my terminal -- just log in and follow the instructions. And if for some reason you've forgotten the password, you might want to sit down and have a think with a Nuka-Cola, if you catch my drift.
GID00052730	I've been asking around, there is no reason for those filters to fail, it must have been sabotaged, there's a rumor going around that one of the Reds did it. It wouldn't surprise me, whenever I walk by a group of them in the cafeteria they all start whispering, I bet they're plotting out what to do next.

GID00052734	Defender Morgan and I executed a reconnaissance mission last night to gauge Raider entrenchment in the structural underground of Fairfax. We located three entrances into underground utility tunnels.
GID00052735	We are able to confirm that the enemy has occupied and fortified positions within the underground, though some appear undefended. We also identified a small weapons cache in the southeast section of the tunnels. While deploying explosives to demolish the cache we were discovered by a Raider patrol. In accordance to mission parameters, we did not engage the enemy, instead retreating to Fort. Raiders will be likely to set up defenses and attach more patrols to the area as a result.
GID00052736	I pulled the log from the East Pump Station computer for the last week. Looking back over the past several weeks, the times are roughly consistent. There's definitely something going on - water shouldn't even be going over to the Westside and yet the log says otherwise. I know I'm on to something.

GID00052752	We've secured the building and are currently implementing our orders for the occupation of Fairfax.
GID00052753	Raider activity in town has increased dramatically ever since we've taken up positions in and around the fort. We've killed a lot of them and scared off plenty others, but they just keep coming back. While there seems to be no limit to people willing to reduce themselves to their way of life, we don't have the luxury of surplus personnel, so we must remain vigilant.
GID00052754	That the raiders take such continued risks to invade our facility appears to confirm suspicions that we've had an intelligence leak, and they're after our technology. They've tried tenaciously to infiltrate the base, but so far haven't stood a chance. Our objective remains the same - protect the research personnel and keep this fort safe until more reinforcements arrive.
GID00052755	Wow, I can't believe these old machines still work. This place looks pretty defensible, and the radiation should keep the majority of people away. Looks like we've found a home, at least for now. First things first, though. We've got to get these corpses out of here. Poor bastards.

I have no idea if anything is in there, but we don't have the manpower to deal with any serious pests. I'm going to have some choice words for Burke the next time I see him. This isn't the first time that idiot skipped over details while surveying an area. I hope to god we're not sitting on some kind of nest. I'm going to send in Frakes and Collins to scout the caves tomorrow. If we have to, we'll use explosives to collapse the cave.

GID00052852	PS I found some pre-War lingerie at the market today. I think you'll like it.
GID00052853	We, the undersigned, do hereby agree for Primm to become full participants in the New California Republic. We accept that we will follow all of the NCR laws and regulations, and support them in all wartime efforts.
GID00052854	This petition is unsigned.
GID00052855	Deputy Beagle would like help finding a new sheriff for Primm. I should look for someone that has some experience with law enforcement, and is familiar with Primm and the surrounding area.

GID00052865	Mr. Hostetler,
GID00052866	Just a reminder your meeting with Accounts Receivable was moved to Tuesday. I've cleared your schedule and moved your lunch plans ahead to 1:45.
GID00052867	-Angie
GID00052868	Every time I try to get Amata to open up, she just pushes me further and further away. Since she was a child, I've tried to instill in her those virtues that have made this Vault what it is today: loyalty, honesty, commitment, hard work.
GID00052869	She does try, and with a lot of guidance has grown into a fine young woman. That makes it all the sadder that she continues to alienate me. She looks at me and sees the Overseer, not the father that has cared for her alone -- alone! -- since she was an infant.
GID00052870	911 Dispatcher: "911, Your call is being recorded, what's your emergency?"
GID00052871	Man: "(screaming)Fire! There's a fire! My house is on fire!"
GID00052872	911 Dispatcher: "Sir please try to stay calm, I'm going to connect you to the Fire Department."

GID00052879	Dispatcher: "Alright sir, the trucks have been sent, is there anyone still in the house?"
GID00052880	Man: "Thank you, no everyone is safe and on the lawn (short pause) I think I hear them now. Thank you, goodbye."
GID00052881	Dispatcher: "Just try to remain a safe distance away from the house until they get there."

GID00052885	911 Dispatcher: "Could you please repeat that sir?"
GID00052886	Man: "(continuing) my banana slippers are like water boats because when the moon winks sometimes it burns my hamster punches (interrupted)"

GID00052898	The radio at the Prospector Saloon in Goodsprings was broken by a visiting Great Khan. Trudy has offered to pay you if you can fix it.
GID00052899	This recipe allows you to make Turbo.
GID00052900	If anyone other than me is reading this, it probably means I'm dead at the hands of whoever the NCR sent looking for Corporal White.
GID00052901	I've bent or broken the law many times in my life, but it was always for the greater good. Such was the case with Corporal White. Killing him was regrettable but necessary - had he been allowed to interfere, Westside would've been cut off from the NCR's water and the crops here would wither and die. I wasn't going to let that happen.
GID00052902	I've paid for my crime. Don't let the people of Westside suffer because of me.

GID00052911	Manny,
GID00052912	You made the right choice, putting us up and keeping it quiet. This weasel Benny's been twitchy since we stole that package from his boss. Making me nervous as hell. But when I found out we'd be passing through on our way to Boulder City, I was sure we could count on you. Let the other Khans say what they want. I know where your loyalty is.
GID00052913	One day you'll remember where you belong, and your brothers and sisters will welcome you back like you never left. You know where to find us.

GID00052918	Keene seems to have caught on about the Stealth Boy Mark II prototype. I told him that it was in no way functional, but I'm not entirely sure he believed me. I'll have to keep an eye on him.
GID00052919	From: AUTOMAILER
GID00052920	To: *ALL RESIDENTS*
GID00052921	REMINDER: The Vault elections are coming up, the primaries start two weeks from today. If you intend to run please announce your candidacy.
GID00052922	VAULT AUTOMATED MESSAGE SYSTEM
GID00052926	The Stealth Boy Mark II prototype is functional - sort of. The Enclave data wasn't complete so I had to make a few guesses here and there. Unfortunately, the data also suggests that while the stealth field has a greater duration, the negative effects on the user are exponentially greater. I can use this to my advantage - the brain wave changes will be more pronounced and it'll be much easier to to figure out what exactly is needed to cure the Nightkin schizophrenia.
GID00052927	Lily has graciously volunteered to be my test subject, despite the risk.
GID00052928	Hope is the key.
GID00052930	Astonishingly enough, the local Nightstalkers have developed a mutation not unlike the stealth field generated by Stealth Boys. Even more importantly, the brains I've dissected have shown heightened levels of endorphins and other neurochemicals, similar to what I've seen in Nightkin brains. If this mutation is natural, perhaps a cure could be synthesized from the Nightstalkers. As far as I can tell, the Nightstalkers don't suffer from schizophrenia like the affected Nightkin.
GID00052931	This action may result in meltdown. As part of safety protocol this action has been locked out from this terminal. Using the Master Override terminal located in the reactor room will bypass all safety features.
GID00052938	Page 65
GID00052939	... real trouble began when a fair number of residents began to call for population control. Foreseeing the issue spiraling out of control I ordered one of the technicians to hook up a locking mechanism linking the armory door to the terminal in my office. The news of the armory being closed off angered a sizable group of residents, they stated it was their right to defend themselves and demanded that they be given access to the armory once more, and I of course denied this request...
GID00052940	Voices, I can hear them through the vents. They sound like plotting, they sound like hate, the Blues never sit with us, they treat us as if we have a disease; maybe we do, this whole vault is sick.
GID00052941	I haven't been able to sleep lately, one of the Blues, he's always creeping around by the security door, and I think he's trying to get in.
GID00052942	We confronted the doctor today, she refused to give us any information, and we were thrown out of the clinic, some of us quite literally. We tried talking to the overseer, but acted as if he didn't know anything about it. I don't believe him, I don't trust him, and I don't trust any of them.

GID00052957	It took some doing, but a few of us got together and managed to distract the people in the clinic long enough for me to get in and do some looking around, I found restraints and enough sedatives to kill a horse. She must be using them to control us, to make us forget, we're just pawns in her sick game.
GID00052958	This is a stack of hand-written recipes, obviously experimental, with many sections crossed out and notes scribbled in the margins. The one that seems to have gone through the most revision is called "Sweet Veal," however the notes indicate a desire to make it taste not like veal but human flesh.
GID00052959	Knight Torres in Hidden Valley wants me to find a laser pistol that's gone missing. The first thing to do is speak with the paladin in charge of the firing range to see if he remembers who was using it.
GID00052960	Maybe, I am insane, maybe this isn't happening, maybe the war never happened, and maybe I'm just trapped in my head.
GID00052961	On Tuesday February 16 at 2 PM, technicians will be running a test of ARCHIMEDES and its connectivity with our plant security system. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES should any employee be outdoors on the plant grounds until the alarm klaxon has ceased and an all-clear is given. We have death and dismemberment waivers from all employees on file and are not responsible for any accidents that should occur during this procedure.
GID00052962	Protective eyewear is MANDATORY for all technicians observing from the tower deck.
GID00052963	It took some convincing, but I finally got him to show me what he found on the doc's computer. He was right, I wouldn't like it. The patient files looked like those from an asylum, the patient names were all in code, but some of them seemed to fit the people around us. But they can't be us! I don't remember being insane, I think I would remember something like that. But, it must be true; it explains the doctor's behavior and the bodyguards, I don't know why I can't remember. It must be that doctor, maybe she's drugging us. I need to get into that office.
GID00052964	I've been working with a friend, he's been trying to hack into the doc's computer, and so far, we haven't had much luck.
GID00052965	I don't trust that doctor; she has bodyguards, what kind of doctor has bodyguards? I've seen the guards bringing her meals; I don't think she ever leaves her office. There's always one posted outside at night too. I wonder what she's hiding.
GID00052968	Trent,
GID00052969	I know no one in the NCR military believes you when you say water's gone missing, but I do. I'll meet up with you at the fields tomorrow and go over the evidence with you. Once I've confirmed my findings, I can go to Lieutenant Romanowski and get to the bottom of this once and for all.

GID00052980	McCarran has requested more frequent supply runs to their outlying outposts. I've been able to negotiate additional terms in our favor, but I may need to lower our hiring standards to meet the demand. I'm already concerned about the reliability of some of the caravaneers. Were it not for the work contracts, I know some of them would have run off a long time ago.
GID00052981	Nobody seems to believe in hard work anymore.
GID00052982	Boone, one of the snipers posted in the model dinosaur in Novac, has enlisted you to try and find out who in town sold his wife to Caesar's Legion. He has requested that, should you find the person responsible, you lead them out in front of the dinosaur while he is on duty. You are to put on his beret as a signal that the person you've brought there is the guilty party.

GID00052988	Dear Lincoln,
GID00052989	Thank you for your endorsement at the Town Hall meeting last night. You are so well respected by the residents, that I am sure it will greatly increase my chances of following you to the "Big Chair." Since Michelle started making plans and gathering people for her External Association Committee the Isolationists have been gathering followers, as you well know. I think having me follow you as Overseer will serve to slow their efforts.
GID00052990	Thanks Again,
GID00052991	George
GID00052992	Efforts to "encourage" Henry Jamison to resign have so far failed. His parents are proving stubborn as well - obviously, they don't want him around anymore than I do.

GID00052995	Michelle,
GID00052996	Thank you again for agreeing to take charge with our external relations. I am sure that you will do represent us, and our interests well. Let me know if I can be of any assistance.

GID00052998	The Mormons are warming up to the idea of a Crimson Caravan branch being established in New Canaan. Naturally, the taxes are such that we'll be at a severe disadvantage to their own caravans.
GID00052999	The long-term solution is to overwhelm them with a flood of cheap NCR goods. I'll have to call in some favors with our contacts back in California, but the potential profit margins are worth it.
GID00053000	From: Lincoln Davis
GID00053001	To: All Residents
GID00053002	Greetings Everyone,
GID00053003	As you all saw in the message from Vincent, we're going to have to start rationing water until we can resolve the leaking issues. Unfortunately, we don't currently have the parts required to fix the underlying cause of the leak. At this point, we have no alternative, but to seek the parts that we need from outside the Vault.
GID00053004	To facilitate this, I'm proud to announce that Michelle Dallian will be forming a new committee, with the goal of creating ties with whatever civilization there may be in the outside world. Michelle and I both have high hopes that we'll have no problem finding the assets we need, and hopefully forming some lasting relationships with the outside world.
GID00053005	Thank you,
GID00053006	Overseer Davis
GID00053007	The last entry of the journal reads:
GID00053008	Things finally seem to be turning around. I made a nice bundle of caps turning in some scrap in the last town I passed, and now I have a new traveling companion. Her name is Jacklyn, and she's pretty cute. I'm not going to get ahead of myself here, but things are looking up! And to think, I was actually beginning to doubt the power of my lucky necklace!
GID00053009	This journal consists of detailed records and observations from Karl's time with the Great Khans. Many of the entries go into great detail about his opinion of their "savage, barbarous customs," and at several points he waxes philosophic about how it's very likely that Caesar's Legion will have to execute the lot of them.
GID00053010	This is an agreement between the Crimson Caravan Company and the Van Graffs to undercut or eliminate all other rival caravan companies in the region, such as the Gun Runners and Cassidy Caravans.
GID00053011	In the case of Cassidy Caravans, Gloria Van Graff has agreed to use mercenaries against Cassidy Caravans to drive down the company's value, allowing Alice McLafferty to purchase the remaining assets at a bargain price.
GID00053012	The Elder has asked me to provide a list of possible locations for the components needed. Unfortunately, our reconnaissance of the area is lacking due to Elijah's insistence that we concentrate all efforts on HELIOS. Ibsen and I have managed to retrieve some information from the datastore on sites of potential interest, but they are mostly military and industrial locations. If only I knew if there are other bunkers, or even one of those old RobCo vaults in the area!
GID00053013	I have just discovered something horrifying. If my projections are right, we must-- but I shouldn't get ahead of myself. The Elder will know what to do. He must.
GID00053015	The combination for my safe is 5-23-34
GID00053016	Squad CG554-2 demonstrates consistently poor marksmanship and lacks basic firearms skills. Team coordination is minimal at best, and individual rivalries crop up frequently. Recommend further basic training and team-building exercises.
GID00053017	Final Analysis: Poor
GID00053018	Incident: Broken Glass
GID00053019	Kevin dropped one of the glass tubes today while forming it. He ended up with a nasty cut on his hand from the broken glass. Fortunately no one else was hurt. I bandaged his hand and had him clean it up before sending him home. One more accident like that and I may have to let him go. Kid's too accident prone.
GID00053020	Incident: Elevator
GID00053021	One of the elevators to the upper loading dock broke down again. Unfortunately Johnathan was inside waiting to unload and the sudden stop caused one of the signs to slip of its pallet and it broke his leg. He'll be out for at least a month while it heals.

GID00053031	The past two years serving as the NCR Ambassador to the Strip have been trying at best and downright horrid at worst.
GID00053033	My work here has been fruitless. I've been unable to get anywhere with Mr. House (or actually meet Mr. House since all I have dealt with are his Securitron's that only serve to frustrate me further.)

GID00053044	Final Report - Ambassador Phillip Granger
GID00053045	With my term here coming to a close, I'm taking a moment to reflect on my accomplishments here. Sadly, they are few and far between. The politics between the families and Mr. House have made it incredibly difficult to deal with any of them.
GID00053046	The Omertas are a group of sleazy lowlifes pretending to be something they aren't. The White Glove Society gives me the creeps (there's something strange going on with them, and I'm not sure I want to know what it is.) The Chairmen are thugs that dress themselves up in fancy suits pretending to be cool.
GID00053047	I'm surprised that they've lasted this long without killing each other, although it's probably due to Mr. House and his Securitron's.
GID00053048	We have our work cut out for us here. I wish my term here was more fruitful than it was, but I'm glad to be returning to the NCR.

GID00053050	ACCESS DENIED - Ranger Detachment reports not available from this system.
GID00053052	From my cold, dead hands.
GID00053055	The Followers of the Apocalypse have asked you to gather information on the Lucky 38 and its master, Mr. House. They have given you a bug to install at an access point to the Lucky 38's data network. Mr. House will be in the penthouse of the tower.
GID00053058	Apparently, the mutants raided a caravan today. One of their rifles jammed. Took about seven minutes to fix. I also performed minor maintenance on the broadcasting tower outside. It's tempting to think that I could have just pulled a switch there and taken this accursed station off the air. No doubt she would have killed me soon afterward, but it might have been worth it just to see the look on her face.
GID00053059	I managed to get Ranger Morales' corpse away from the Fiends. I should return to Pvt. Morales and let her know her husband's body is safe.

GID00053086	Status: Failure
GID00053087	Notes: While v.32 didn't have the power yield of the v.31 or v.30, we managed to increase the stabilization threshold by approximately 27.35%. This is promising, however we still have yet to come up with a solution for the matter inversion issues.
GID00053088	Version: 33

GID00053092	Status: Failure
GID00053093	Notes: Interesting. I'm not sure where we got this data from, it is a completely different direction from what we've been working on. We managed to cycle the matter inversion using a polarized quantum spin. I think that we solved the issue with the Compensation field, I have high hopes for the next weapon.
GID00053094	Version: 35
GID00053095	Status: Success
GID00053096	Notes: That data we received from Xuan did the trick. We managed to get a stable build model. I don't think this weapon is ready for mass production yet, but it should show that we have a working prototype. We should be able to get these issues resolved in a later build.

GID00053105	Not much to report today. The mood is unusually somber in the wake of Dr. Peter's passing. There's a strange rumor going around that the commotion downstairs was caused by, of all things, Dr. Peter's corpse suddenly animating and attacking people. I don't know who would start such a vicious rumor, but it's in exceptionally bad taste.
GID00053106	Note written by Marcus
GID00053107	On a lark, the guys down in pest control sent up a sample of a substance one of their specimens secretes to attract insects. Tests show that the substance has a mood-altering effect on smaller mammals. If anyone volunteers, we can begin human testing soon.
GID00053108	Quite a number of the staff have begun to show symptoms of some sort of viral infection. I've begun to order them to stay in bed and recover, but at this rate there won't be anyone left to do research!
GID00053109	Yields continue to improve. Splicing together cultivar GN188 with the existing corn samples has produced a hybrid that responds better to the artificial lights we have.
GID00053110	On a side note, Dr. Peters has missed his third straight day due to illness. His work ethic hasn't exactly been stellar to this point, so I'm requesting confirmation from the clinic that he is in fact sick.
GID00053111	Notice to all Regulators seeking Lawful Bounties in the Capital Wastes:
GID00053112	Let it be known that the following individual is offered for bounty in the sum of 1,000 caps or similar compensation of expended equipment and/or medical expense, for crimes against the good people of the Capital Wasteland and environs:

GID00053122	We managed to get the rest of the path cleared. Some pre-war fencing was mostly intact, and we were able to set it up as a makeshift barrier, on the more dangerous cliffs. I hope none of these jarheads fall off. We found a few cave entrances, as we were clearing rubble. They lead back to each other, with just a single collapsed path which appears to lead down into the mountain. The damn survey team didn't mention any caves. I hope we don't find any more little surprises.
GID00053123	Born -- 2267
GID00053124	Died --
GID00053125	Only son of Jonathan and Jessica (both deceased).
GID00053126	Last of the Maxson bloodline.
GID00053127	As an infant, sent to the Citadel to be fostered by Elder Owyn Lyons. The reason for this decision was two-fold:
GID00053128	1.) Recent internal conflict amongst the Western Brotherhood of Steel created an unsafe environment for the child. It was believed that the Citadel -- despite being located in hostile territory -- would increase his probability of survival.
GID00053129	2.) Elder Lyons, at that time, was in high favor with the Western Elders, and deemed a perfect candidate to provide care and training to the Squire.
GID00053130	Recent events have led to a lack of communication with the Western Elders. As a result, Squire Maxson will remain at the Citadel indefinitely.

GID00053133	Born -- 2097
GID00053134	Died -- NA
GID00053135	Son of Maxson II and grandson of Roger Maxson.
GID00053136	A gifted soldier, John Maxson was promoted to the rank of Paladin at age 38, in the year 2135. Soon after, he was promoted once more to Head Paladin.
GID00053137	In 2155, Maxson was promoted to the illustrious position of High Elder when his father Maxson II was killed in glorious battle with the Raiders known as Vipers.
GID00053138	Records indicate John Maxson had some dealings with a mysterious figured identified only as the "Vault Dweller" in the year 2162, at the age of 65.

GID00053142	Born -- NA (teenager of unspecified age in 2077)
GID00053143	Died -- 2155
GID00053144	Took over command of the Brotherhood of Steel as High Elder in 2135, when his father, Roger Maxson, died of cancer.
GID00053145	In 2155, while hunting down a group of Raiders knows as the Vipers, Maxson (who was unhelmeted at the time) was grazed in the head by an arrow. A deadly Viper poison killed him within hours.
GID00053146	Born -- NA
GID00053147	Died -- 2135
GID00053148	Second in command of the security team stationed at the West Tek research facility; later relocated to the Mariposa Military Base.
GID00053149	Assumed command after nervous breakdown of security team leader Colonel Robert Spindel. Executed scientists after learning of their research into the Forced Evolutionary Virus, or FEV.
GID00053150	Deserted from military just before the war. Maxson ordered the families of all base personnel brought inside the facility, thereby sparing their lives.
GID00053151	Led survivors in their Exodus to the Lost Hills bunker. Maxson's wife was killed on the journey.
GID00053152	At Lost Hills, Roger Maxson formed the Brotherhood of Steel. As the organization's first High Elder, he formed the Orders of Paladins, Knights and Scribes.
GID00053154	There was a fight in the yard today between some of us and the first gens. Marcus made a speech about how we need to work together, but why should we? We were the master's favorites! We don't need their help. Rhonda says we'd be better off without them.
GID00053163	Is anyone down there?? Security is trying to hold off, well, I don't know what they're trying to hold off. Please, send security up at once!
GID00053164	With Dr. Bailey watching over his sick wife and daughter in their quarters down in the Common Area, I'm officially in charge of the level, and I am requesting security at once!
GID00053165	Oh my god. It's actually happening. We have readings across the board of launches happening everywhere. They must've thrown everything they had, and it looks like we didn't hold back either. The computer says we have 2 minutes until the first missile drops.

GID00053167	TO THE NCR PRESIDENT
GID00053168	TO THE NCR COUNCIL
GID00053169	FROM ROBERT EDWIN HOUSE
GID00053170	As Chief Executive of the Free Economic Zone of New Vegas, I hereby demand the IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL of all NCR military personnel from New Vegas and its surrounding territories.
GID00053171	a) Yes, "all military personnel" includes NCR Rangers.
GID00053172	b) "New Vegas and its surrounding territories" includes (but is not limited to) Hoover Dam, McCarran International Airport, HELIOS One, and the El Dorado Substation.
GID00053173	IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE that my vast army of heavily-armed Securitrons has been rather inflexibly programmed to respond to acts of aggression with overwhelming force.
GID00053174	a) For examples of "heavily-armed" and "overwhelming force," I will refer you to the pitiless campaign of extermination my Securitrons will have visited upon Caesar's Legion by the time you are reading this document.
GID00053175	b) Any NCR military personnel who do not withdraw from New Vegas and its territories will be seen as committing an "act of aggression."
GID00053176	NCR civilians are NOT subject to this order of withdrawal! They may visit New Vegas freely, enjoying all that the Vegas Strip has to offer!
GID00053177	So long as NCR military personnel comply with this order to withdraw, electricity and water will continue to flow from Hoover Dam to the NCR.
GID00053178	a) Electricity: 5 caps per kilowatt hour.
GID00053179	b) Water: 5 caps per gallon
GID00053180	The NCR Council's Office of Budget will receive invoices bi-weekly. Prices are subject to change without notice.

GID00053189	We need a medical team up here now!
GID00053190	Dr. Peters just returned with one of the security escorts, who is horribly wounded. When I asked them where the other security officer was, he just paled and shook his head.
GID00053191	In the meantime, Dr. Bailey has ordered that the door to the caves be sealed until a further investigation can take place.
GID00053192	Assistant Mathers went into the caves at 18:46 today and still hasn't returned. Requesting security escort for science personnel to conduct a search.

GID00053213	Day 19
GID00053214	Ok, now I'm starting to hear noises. During my watch last night, I definitely heard splashes down in the water. I requested an additional survey from McCarran, but they blew it off as nerves. Fish don't make that much damn noise! I sent down half of the squad with lamps, but they couldn't see anything. We can't find any other cave openings. Maybe I've caught a little crazy from Jackson. I wish we had some Cateye. Can't see shit at night.
GID00053215	Nobody ought concern themselves too much with Miguel's scouting report. While he did spot some folk out past the valley, they rode by and weren't like to have noticed him or us. Let's all just keep to the homestead for a few days and avoid using open fires for a few days, just to be safe.
GID00053216	I'm trying to fabricate a windmill for us. If anybody spots any long, flat sheets of metal, you let me know. I have most of the other parts I need, but haven't found good metal for the blades yet.
GID00053217	Been a good few months for us since the coming out. Going by the dosimeter tests, we're taking some exposure to radiation, but as long as Doc Johanson keeps folks on their meds, we don't seem to be having trouble with rad sickness. Irrigation and fertilization has been good, and though we lost the goats and chickens, the cows have done good. Those hardy beasts don't seem to mind this new world. Miles and Jacky are devoting some time to husbandry to keep the cows breeding and available.

GID00053230	2. Orders are to observe the flow and not skip ranks. A superior may only give orders to his direct subordinates, and not to those beneath them. In this way harmony of intent and cohesion of thought is maintained.

GID00053235	I want to remind everyone to come by my tent every day for your radiation screening. Even if you don't think you've been exposed to radiation, the test takes only minutes. Take my word for it; you'd much rather be inconvenienced in the morning than come down with a case of radiation sickness. I'm more than happy to give a detailed account of that scenario to the next person who misses an appointment.
GID00053236	My turn to be boss this month. Seems stupid to me, I don't want to be in charge. I'm just going to do whatever Jim tells me to.
GID00053237	Due to a class seven system failure, all service engineers are required to report for duty. Failure to report will result in termination per clause 45.7a of the Maintenance Service Union Contract.

GID00053240	Could maintenance look into the duct work here on level 2 again? I know you guys took a look at this last week, but I swear the noise is back. I even have other people that can back me up on it this time, too.
GID00053241	I finally got everyone to agree to let me set up some generators for power. I can understand their nerves, considering what technology did to us all, but not making use of every resource is wasteful, and a sure path to Hell in this situation. Coming out into the light has done wonders for everyone, but we all can get a little stir crazy, even out here. I'm setting this thing up for everyone to use.

GID00053251	The basic assignments are this:
GID00053252	-Rangers will secure the perimeter and keep an eye out for any external threats.
GID00053253	-Additional Rangers will be stationed around the stage and the crowd. Their primary job is to keep an eye on the crowd to make sure nothing funny happens.
GID00053254	I want sharpshooters positioned at the following potential sniper locations:
GID00053255	Visitor Center Roof
GID00053256	Western Ridge
GID00053257	Dam Tower 1 Roof - I want a radio up here to check in.

GID00053261	We've received word that the President's vertibird is having some issues with the flight control computer. I've had some of the techs here examine the logs that were sent and we think we can fix the issue with a small computer update. Ranger Grant has given me permission to have one of the NCR Engineers examine the vertibird when it arrives as well as having our computer update the vertibird's systems after it arrives.

GID00053274	Hoover Dam Presidential Visit Schedule
GID00053275	The President will visit Hoover Dam to give a speech to the troops and award a medal to Private Watson for his bravery and service to the NCR.
GID00053276	The President is scheduled to arrive via vertibird from California. The vertibird will land on the top of the Visitor's Center where Colonel Moore will meet the President and escort him out to the stage.
GID00053277	After a brief introduction by Colonel Moore, the President will give his speech. The speech will only take approximately four minutes. During the speech the President will award a medal to Private Jeremy Watson for his service to the NCR.
GID00053278	Once the speech is over, the President will be escorted directly back through the visitor center to his vertibird for immediate departure.
GID00053279	In event of an emergency, the speech will be canceled and the President will be rushed to the vertibird for immediate departure. If the is a problem with the vertibird, a room on the second level of the visitor center will be used as a safe room to keep the President secure until any threat is over. Access to this room has been restricted and Colonel Moore has the key in her desk.
GID00053280	I've been a lot of places in my day, and everywhere you'd find those damned Radscorpions.

GID00053317	Well, I can't say that I'm surprised. You were a devious worm when we started here all those years ago. I guess someone has to take the blame, and it may as well be your "old friend." That waste spill never would have happened if you didn't push the team so hard, or if you paid for actual competent personnel.
GID00053318	I'll be happy to take my retirement package. Good riddance to you and this forsaken place.

GID00053320	Seriously, can we stop calling the Vendortron a "Vendortron?" Let's give the thing a proper name, like Bob (we're not calling it Bob). We'll vote on it at the end of the week. Please, please, please come up with something decent.

GID00053322	One of the Crimson Caravan guards, identified as Robert Wilson, decided it would be funny to take a shot at our Vendortron. He's lucky he didn't get a .308 through his idiot skull.
GID00053323	We're currently negotiating with McLafferty for reparations, but in the mean time we need to update the Vendortron's recognition software to filter out all Crimson Caravan employees. We'll also need to pull some strings over at McCarran and get them temporarily barred from purchasing ammo there, as well.

GID00053348	* Received yet another shipment of ammunition. This is the seventh shipment we have received without request.
GID00053349	* Running low on Fancy Lads.

GID00053351	* All Clear.

GID00053353	* Sighted Legion scout party bound for Bitter Springs. Intercept arrived two hours after we called it in - sent complaint to Hanlon about NCR militia taking forever.
GID00053354	* Shipment arrived with more .308 rounds (not requested). Sent complaint to Hanlon but didn't get a response.
GID00053355	Friday:
GID00053356	* Rabid jackal wandered into camp providing much needed target practice.
GID00053357	* Found crate of rifles in with some rations shipped last week - where are all these surplus weapons coming from?
GID00053358	The paperwork Aurelius of Phoenix gave me appears to list movement of troops, numbers of men in various strategic locations, and various communication with Caesar about raiding plans for the southern wastes of Nevada. Of course all of this information is outdated and prove counterproductive to the NCR's efforts to stop Legion raids in the region.
GID00053359	"Get you to a smithy! Forge the shard with sword, and defeat Grelok!"
GID00053360	The wizard tosses some pebbles down to shoo you away and busies himself conjuring colored puffs of smoke.
GID00053369	"Hoo-hoo! The slayer of Grelok approaches, raw stone in hand, just as I've seen!" The wizard's pointy hat bobs excitedly as he points a finger at you. Suddenly, a pale orange arc of light extends from the knobby finger and draws the gemstone from your bag before you can react. The gemstone halts and hovers in the air before the wizard's nose.
GID00053370	"Essence be true, powers renew, Fatty-Hoo-Do!" With that, he slaps the hovering stone, smashing it against the smooth stone of the tower. In a burst of light, the stone splits into two, and one lands in each outstretched palm of the hopping little wizard.
GID00053371	"Shard for the sword. Wrap her in iron and she'll find Grelok's black heart for you. Take the chaff, too. You'll need payment for a smith to forge the weapon." He tosses the stones down which you leap forward to catch safely.
GID00053372	The wizard is shooing you away, his sleeves flopping about.
GID00053373	"Go! Find the gemstone and return, so I can play my part!"
GID00053376	The wizard's brow furrows. "Got things a bit out of order, have I? Come back when you've got a powerful gemstone. Soon - I've never got to fulfill a prophecy before!"

GID00053382	Camp Searchlight Comm Officer's Log
GID00053383	A radscorpion made it into the camp last night. Some of the troopers patrolling the border are getting sloppy. The only reason anyone noticed it was because several of the comm stations were acting oddly. When the trooper on duty went outside to check the transmitter dishes he found the scorpion chewing on several of the cables. What's the point of having patrols if shit like this is going to keep happening?

GID00053386	Camp Searchlight Comm Officer's Log
GID00053387	The Quartermaster has been bitching to me again about missing supplies and bad communications. I keep telling him that nothing is wrong with the comm system and that his numbers must be off. I don't think he believes me. The bastard will probably keep bugging me until I can either prove he's wrong or find someone else to blame. Damn it I hate this shit.

GID00053389	1687865 often misinterprets other's actions as hostile. He perceives friendly interactions with nurses as patronizing. We've also noticed that the longer other patients remain in contact with 1687865 the more readily they are to act aggressively towards him (due to 1687865's defensive nature) thus reinforcing 1687865's perceived hostility.
GID00053396	The papers here include schematics and recipes for explosives and blueprints for a monorail car with several points of vulnerability marked. They are all marked with a stamp bearing the logo of Caesar's Legion.

GID00053416	=== Weapons Research ===
GID00053417	Subject -> Missile Launcher
GID00053418	Researcher ->J. J. Browne
GID00053419	Analysis -> After several attempts to modify the Missile Launcher to increase its accuracy, I conclude that it cannot be done. In fact, this is third one I've "broken" in the past month. I will pass the task on to L. J. Rogers, who seems confident enough that it can be modified and that I merely overlooked obvious miscalculations. Technically, the Missile Launcher I've recently worked on is not broken. It just does not function properly. I have since locked it up in Weapons Storage.

GID00053421	Subject -> Enclave Armor
GID00053422	Researcher ->T. T. Bowser
GID00053423	Analysis -> After several radiation experiments, I can safely conclude that the Enclave Armor is more radiation resistant than Power Armor, although not by much. Regardless, more research and tests are needed to determine exactly what makes it more resistant.

GID00053429	=== Weapons Research ===
GID00053430	Subject -> Pulse Grenade
GID00053431	Researcher -> L. J. Rogers
GID00053432	Analysis -> The Pulse Grenade is the most effective weapon against robotics. Upon detonation, an intense electromagnetic pulse is emitted, severely crippling any robotics within the explosion radius. They are extremely handy against the many robots and turrets found throughout the Capital Wasteland.
GID00053433	Ambassador Crocker,
GID00053434	Captain Pappas dropped off a report for you while you were out. The report is attached.

GID00053436	Security Lacking at Checkpoints
GID00053437	There have been recent cases of civilians and some troopers sneaking in restricted items into the Strip. Security needs to be increased to make sure that this stops right away. I'm instructing the MP's to tighten security at the checkpoints and any violations will be severely punished.
GID00053438	Recently confiscated items have been stored in the store room at the Military Police Headquarters. I have locked the room and have the key with me.
GID00053439	Captain Marie Pappas
GID00053440	=== Weapons Research ===
GID00053441	Subject -> Minigun
GID00053442	Researcher -> H. P. Smith
GID00053443	Analysis -> Why am I researching such old technology? Practice, practice, practice, blah, blah, blah. Anyway, the Minigun uses a much smaller round than most of the rifles found throughout the Wastes. However, the rate of fire of the Minigun makes up for the small, 5mm round, sending a hail of bullets toward its target. Its shear size, coupled with its trademark sound, is enough to send anyone in its path running for cover. It's a great weapon for suppressing fire, letting others flank the unsuspecting enemy. A typical cartridge holds around 100 rounds.
GID00053449	NCR Embassy Status Report #01-50

GID00053452	Ambassador Crocker has once again requested a meeting with Mr. House, a response has yet to be received.
GID00053453	Current supplies at the Embassy are within normal ranges.
GID00053454	Captain Pappas reports no unusual activity on the Strip.

GID00053457	=== Weapons Research ===
GID00053458	Subject -> Plasma Rifle
GID00053459	Researcher -> R. R. Rasting
GID00053460	Analysis -> The Plasma Rifle, like the Laser Rifle, uses a micro fusion cell as its power supply. It taps into the cell, essentially a small fusion reactor, to produce a toroid of plasma that is ejected down a superconductor barrel. A typical micro fusion cell can supply the rifle with around eight shots. Further research needs to be done to determine exactly how the plasma retains its density while traveling through the air toward its target.

GID00053467	Personal Log - Liza O'Malley
GID00053468	Things have been getting a little busy around here lately. I have a feeling that a lot of things are going on that I'm not aware of. There's a lot more papers and reports getting passed around, but also a lot of things under the table. All I know is that I need a vacation. I'm getting a little tired of spending all my time at the Embassy and need to get out. Maybe I'll hit up the casinos one of these nights.
GID00053469	Subject -> Laser Rifle/Pistol
GID00053470	Researcher -> J. T. Benning
GID00053471	Analysis ->
GID00053473	Critical Components ->
GID00053474	Power drawn from Micro fusion Cell is processed through a Wave/Particle Diverter (manuf:Gen Atomics Intnl). Diverters are protected by carbon-fiber housing, preventing frequent malfunction, but when a diverter fails the weapon becomes unusable, and this part is extremely difficult to replace or repair.
GID00053475	Precision-cut lenses focus optic energy. Lenses are prone to damage and can grossly affect precision of the firing weapon's firing mechanism. Lenses are easily replaced with any clear glass, but require a great deal of skill to fabricate.
GID00053476	Field Operation ->
GID00053477	A fully charged cell will discharge 20 bolts from a pistol, and 12 shots from the rifle model. Recoil is negligible compared to ballistic weapons, so long range combat requires less marksmanship ability of the soldier.
GID00053478	Maintenance ->
GID00053479	The chassis are easily opened, allowing the weapon to be serviced in the field. Purified water and a clean cloth can be used to wash mirrored and glass components, slowing wear on the weapon. The weapon can also overheat after a period of intense use. This can be counteracted by submerging the barrel of the weapon in water, which helps cool heat sinks located beneath the chassis shell in that area.
GID00053480	Tweedle dumpling, tweedle dare,
GID00053481	Curse the younglings, if you care.
GID00053482	For theirs is youth, and joy and power,

GID00053484	And when they come, these five of sun,
GID00053485	The Lightman's progeny have won.
GID00053486	So sound the trumpets, clear and loud!
GID00053487	And think beyond the Eastern shroud.
GID00053491	There then rose a rustle and rumble from all corners of the room, as rocking horse and railway car, bookend and baby doll, toy and game alike all blossomed into impossible life.
GID00053497	This holotape contains an list of NCR personnel on active duty at Ranger Station Alpha. Aside from one Ranger who suffered a fractured ankle during a fall, the station has been at full strength for months.
GID00053498	Squad CG554-2 has demonstrated an appalling lack of skill with regards to the basic explosive armaments of the NCR Army. It is, to speak frankly, a miracle they retain all of their limbs. Extensive retraining with dummy rounds is highly recommended.
GID00053499	Final Analysis: Poor

GID00053512	Note: Patient checked himself in at the urging of friends regarding a serious dependency on the drug known as Jet. Preliminary tests show continued use of the drug is very dangerous due to the patient's pre-existing heart condition (coronary arterial disease). Under no circumstances should any sort of stimulant (like Psycho) be taken, particularly with the patient's current drug of choice.

GID00053535	Knowing Stanley -- and the schedule the Overseer has him on -- the problem isn't likely to get better anytime soon. So it's aspirin, indefinitely.
GID00053536	Bannon has asked me to search Seagrave Holmes' room to see if I can find anything incriminating about him. Then Bannon can stop him from taking over his council seat.
GID00053567	Brig. Gen. Scott Lowe of the U.S. Army will be visiting the facility starting next Monday and staying onsite indefinitely. When ARCHIMEDES goes live, he will be the only person here allowed to authorize its use for anything other than a test. Civilian employees are not required to salute, but it is expected of everyone that you observe thorough grooming and hygiene regimens and dress neatly while the general is with us. The general expects the best from all his men, and Poseidon men should be no different in the presence of such a fine and decorated soldier.
GID00053585	don't believe it. Frank showed up today. He was on a sales trip when the blast hit, selling generators to a mining operation in Pennsylvania. Being in those shafts probably saved his life, but the shock wave also knocked out every power line feeding light them light and air. Falling debris killed the foreman standing right next to him. He doesn't even know how long he was crawling around those tunnels before he got outside, the poor bastard.
GID00053586	Sounds like the water's boiling. Some hot soup will do him good, even if it's that powdered crap we hauled in here last year.
GID00053614	MARRY CRISMAS!
GID00053615	Cute kid, huh?
GID00053644	Robin wanted to play with the computer for Christmas, so I siphoned some juice from the fusion generator to power this old thing. I know she'd rather be playing outside in the snow, but she's a good kid. Knows that we can't go outside yet. I'll check the fallout levels again tomorrow while she's playing, but I doubt we'll be heading out anytime soon. Damn commies must have hit us hard.
GID00053645	Finally done. Maggie wanted us to sign up at a Vault-Tec shelter, but I've never trusted those bastards. It took a lot of work, but Frank helped me get all the parts together and hauled out to the acreage to build this shelter. Air filtration, chemical toilets, artesian well, the whole nine yards. Frank's connections got us the generator cheap, too. And we don't have to worry about sharing quarters with whoever got their name on some waiting list when the day comes.
GID00053646	Wish I could say "if" the day comes, but it just seems like a matter of time now. How could it have come to this?

GID00053655	The stash is hidden downstairs in one of the freezers. Rocky set it up. You know his style. Don't forget the key -- you'll need it to unlock the compartment.
GID00053656	Again, not two hours after I had fallen, asleep I heard that noise again, it's mechanical, like something heavy being pushed then, it's hard to describe, something that sounds like an elevator perhaps? I've seen the blueprints of the vault, there's no way there could be an elevator there; what would it lead to? I think I'll take a walk around on the second floor, it is late no one will notice me, besides if anyone did it might be good for the experiment anyway.
GID00053666	There's something strange about that other overseer; I think he's up to something. Maybe we were given different orders? Maybe this is all just in my head; the experiments we are conducting must be starting to affect me. The noises, I'm sure there is a perfectly logical explanation for them. I'll have write him, after all we aren't to be seen speaking to each other. Tomorrow then, maybe after a good night's sleep my mind will be in better order.

GID00053684	It's amazing! This place is a radio station! If we can get it repaired, we can broadcast music across the wastes, just like Rhonda and I used to listen to. Ah Rhonda, how I wish you hadn't gone away. I asked all of the mutants here for help, but none of them could do anything for you. Which makes me doubt they can fix this place...
GID00053697	Tony was kind enough to build this terminal and set it up for me. All for 30 caps worth of Rosie. Ha!
GID00053698	The life of a Mayor suits me just fine. I'm glad I didn't go any further east. I'm making plenty of caps right here off Rosie and Sylvia, who attract plenty of interest from troops at the Mojave Outpost. (Guess you spend enough time standing around that backwater and you're ready to hop on something that looks like a Molerat and doesn't smell much better.) And the local "shops" are all giving me a percentage of sales to the troops because it's my girls who bring them in. Ha! They think they're shrewd negotiators for getting me to accept a 15% cut instead of 20%.
GID00053699	Another year in this dump, two at the most, and it's back to Hub for me. Maybe I'll run for office there! Ha!
GID00053700	Mayor Joseph B. Steyn
GID00053701	(Doesn't that look official!)
GID00053702	I can hardly believe my luck. Literally. I'm agape.
GID00053703	Just now I was approached by a rather intense young man calling himself "Mr. Fox." (Yeah, right.) When we were alone in my office, he let it be known that he is a member of Caesar's Legion (!!!).
GID00053704	He knew that NCR troops and Powder Gangers often spend time in Nipton. It turns out that the Legion hates and wishes to make an example of both groups, the NCR for obvious reasons, and Powder Gangers for harassing Legion raiding parties on this side of the river.
GID00053705	I didn't have to think a moment about Mr. Fox's proposition before accepting it. All I have to do is convince the Powders to kidnap the NCR troops at night. When both groups are in town, the Legion boys will scoop everyone up. Ha!
GID00053706	For this simple task, I have been offered 8,000 CAPS!!! I could almost go back to the NCR right away... but who knows how much else I might make off this Legion lackey?
GID00053707	I'm going to start stockpiling some supplies in a safe house between here and the Mojave Outpost, just in case I decide to head back home in a hurry...
GID00053708	Very exciting!
GID00053709	Signed, with a steady hand,

GID00053711	Super-Mayor Joseph B. Steyn, III Esq.
GID00053712	Bl0m3
GID00053713	A promising development, if I do say so myself! It seems things went to hell at the NCR Correctional Facility north of here, and escaped prisoners are roaming free.
GID00053714	Sounds like a bad thing - and would be, if not for the political acumen and interpersonal alchemy of yours truly, Mayor Joseph B. Steyn, Esq. I sent the Jims out to make contact with the prisoners (or "Powder Gangers," rather - they insist on this name) to let them know Nipton's open for trade - with free turns with the girls as door prizes.
GID00053715	Ha! You know they went for that deal. As sold by Little Jim, anyway. Big Jim, R.I.P.
GID00053716	I see a lot of potential here so long as I can keep the NCR troops and Powders (ridiculous name) from running into each other and shooting it out in the streets. Luckily, the troopers only come at night (double entendre), so if the Powders will only come during the day (again), I'll have them coming (third time, the charm) and going.
GID00053717	Yours in confidence,

GID00053724	Genus: Pandinus
GID00053725	Based on research, it first glance appears to be an enlarged Pandinus Imperator, but further testing is required to make a more precise identification. The subject's vesicle has mutated to match its enlarged hypodermic aculeus and the neurotoxin now acts on the potassium and calcium channels. Captive subject was hostile and should be considered a minor threat, though they could prove a problem in larger numbers. Anecdotal reports of specimens even larger than those we have observed exist, but it is likely that such reports are exaggerations.
GID00053726	Upon further reflection, I have determined that it is my best interests, and the best interests of the New California Republic, to transfer sovereignty of the Vegas Strip to the NCR.
GID00053727	If all terms are agreed upon, annexation would occur one year from today.
GID00053728	a) I am to be granted full status as a citizen of the NCR and immunity from prosecution for any activities prior to annexation.
GID00053729	b) I will be recognized as the sole proprietor of the Vegas Strip, a commercial property.
GID00053730	c) I will be subject to all laws of the NCR, including personal and property taxes.
GID00053731	d) NCR functionaries will police the Strip; I will retire my Securitron police force and limit their movement to the grounds and interior of the Lucky 38.
GID00053732	Please confirm that these terms are agreeable. I do not foresee any objections on your part.

GID00053735	The New Vegas Strip
GID00053737	Turns out I don't have specific data on my satellite, but the registration format suggests that it's a stationary micro-nuclear weapons platform. Tracking data appears to confirm this; the thing hasn't moved in the week I've been tracking it. Without a targeting platform at my disposal, sending an activation code would only cause it to drop a payload directly on top of this area. Not exactly what I'm aiming for, but I'll keep the codes handy just in case.
GID00053738	What a lucky break! I pinged an orbiting body successfully today. Registration ID is USDOD-21TXH, callsign "Highwater Trouser". I'll begin tracking it and cross-reference the registration information with the data I've got.
