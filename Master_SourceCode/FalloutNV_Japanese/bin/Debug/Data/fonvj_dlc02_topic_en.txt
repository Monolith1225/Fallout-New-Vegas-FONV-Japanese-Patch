GID00086412	I'm ready to go to Zion.
GID00086413	Okay, let's do it! Zion here we come!
GID00086414	We're all ready to get going.
GID00086415	We're both set. Let's go.
GID00086416	All right, let's go. I'm ready.
GID00086417	Joshua told me you needed a few things. I think this is everything.
GID00086418	I checked on everything in the valley and got you the map of Grand Staircase.
GID00086419	Yes, go!
GID00086420	Tell me about Waking Cloud's family.
GID00086421	Well, I returned the calf to its mother, and didn't even kill any of the Bighorners.
GID00086422	Well, I returned the calf to its herd. Had to kill a few Bighorners to do it, though.
GID00086423	Well, all of the Bighorners are dead. Problem solved!
GID00086424	I had to kill the Bighorners, but I saved the little one.
GID00086426	Where is Vault 22 located?
GID00086427	I've heard of some strange goings-on at Vault 22. Know any details?
GID00086428	You're lying. I've been to Vault 22. No one's lived there in 150 years.
GID00086429	Did you notice I'm wearing a Pip-Boy, too?
GID00086430	What are you doing here?
GID00086431	About your husband... I'm afraid he was killed by White Legs during the evacuation.
GID00086432	Relax, I've humped this load across the Mojave on my own two feet long enough. I can handle it.
GID00086433	Hey, man, I'm cool. I got a big backpack and everything!
GID00086434	Hey, man, I'm cool. I got a big backpack and everything!
GID00086435	Not only could I carry my own gear, I could carry yours, his, and one of your brahmins'.
GID00086436	Don't worry about me. I'm used to finding out-of-the-way places to stuff my gear.
GID00086437	What's with this obsession you seem to have with "civilization?"
GID00086438	I talked to Joshua about your thoughts on civilization.
GID00086439	<Lie> Daniel isn't avoiding talking about your family. He's just preoccupied with all of this.
GID00086440	Who is Joshua Graham, and why shouldn't I talk about him?
GID00086441	Do you have any family?
GID00086442	I like your bear glove. Where can I get one?
GID00086443	Tell me more about the job.
GID00086444	Tell me a little about this area - any interesting wildlife?
GID00086445	So, about those Bighorners....
GID00086446	Tell me about the Bighorner problem again.
GID00086447	Any idea where to start looking for these pre-War supplies Daniel needs?
GID00086448	Tell me a little about this area - any interesting wildlife?
GID00086449	Follows-Chalk seems like he's interested in seeing more of the world.
GID00086450	What was that like to grow up in New Reno?
GID00086451	Tell me about the Ghost of She.
GID00086452	Why the weight limit?
GID00086453	How come I can't bring all my stuff?
GID00086454	Tell me about Happy Trails Caravan Company.
GID00086455	Tell me more about Joshua Graham.
GID00086456	Who were those tribals who attacked me?
GID00086457	"Deadeye," huh? How did you get that nickname?
GID00086458	Do you have any other special skills or abilities?
GID00086459	Where'd you get the Vault suit?
GID00086460	Tell me about Caliente.
GID00086461	What's your deal?
GID00086462	Give me some info on this Daniel. Who is he?
GID00086463	Why do you need a map of Grand Staircase?
GID00086464	I want to know more about you.
GID00086465	What do you use your Pip-Boy for?
GID00086466	Were the 80s a gang, or a tribe?
GID00086467	Tell me more about your tribe.
GID00086468	What do you know about Salt-Upon-Wounds?
GID00086469	I understand this caravan is headed to Zion. What can you tell me about the area?
GID00086470	You mentioned you need healing powder. I have some, if you're still interested.
GID00086471	What do you know of the White Legs?
GID00086472	What do you know about the White Legs?
GID00086473	Who or what is the Father in the Cave?
GID00086474	Is there any other way I can help the Sorrows?
GID00086475	Wait here.
GID00086476	I haven't been through Utah recently - what's the situation like?
GID00086477	You do anything around here, besides talk too much?
GID00086478	You do anything around here, besides make women sick?
GID00086479	What do you do here?
GID00086482	Why are you so eager to evacuate Zion? You don't seem to be a pacifist.
GID00086483	What did you say about a courier? Who were you expecting?
GID00086484	I see you're wearing a Pip-boy and Vault suit.
GID00086485	What do you know about the Father in the Caves?
GID00086486	Why won't you tell me about what happened at New Canaan?
GID00086487	I've met Caesar, you know. What do you think he would say if I told him you were here?
GID00086488	Medicine check.
GID00086489	Unwarranted hostility and general agitation. How long have you been a Psycho addict?
GID00086490	Are you feeling all right?
GID00086491	Let's get going.
GID00086504	Yes, I'm sure.
GID00086505	Actually, let me take care of some more things first.
GID00086506	What can you tell me about New Canaan?
GID00086507	How about a game of Caravan to kill some time?
GID00086508	How about another game of Caravan?
GID00086509	All right, I'll come back when I'm carrying less than 75 pounds.
GID00086510	All right, I'll come back when I'm carrying less than 100 pounds.
GID00086511	Why can't you get to Salt Lake City?
GID00086512	It sounds like Happy Trails isn't in the best financial shape.
GID00086513	So, you guys are totally rich, right?
GID00086514	Do you know anything about their religion?
GID00086515	You don't know what happened to their mission?
GID00086516	Tell me about the raiders.
GID00086517	Degenerate tribes?
GID00086518	Warlords? How dangerous are they?
GID00086519	I had some other questions.
GID00086520	Like I care. Let's just go. I'm ready.
GID00086521	I think Joshua's right. We should fight the White Legs.
GID00086522	Don't worry. I think leaving Zion is for the best.
GID00086523	I need to think about this.
GID00086524	No, not yet.
GID00086525	Here's one healing powder.
GID00086526	Take all I have.
GID00086527	I came in with the Happy Trails Caravan. We were attacked by tribals. I'm the only survivor.
GID00086528	Oh, heh. I just walked here. No big deal.
GID00086529	Who are you to be asking me questions?
GID00086530	Anything to help. I'll do what I can.
GID00086531	If it will get me out of here, sure.
GID00086532	Come on. I got you everything you needed. Just give me the damned map.
GID00086533	I apologize, Daniel. I think stress got the best of me.
GID00086534	Sorry, I uh... didn't mean to insult you or whatever.
GID00086535	Fine.
GID00086536	I'll be taking the map now.
GID00086537	That's an awful lot of responsibility to take on.
GID00086538	You're right to leave, but I don't think you should kill any of the White Legs.
GID00086539	If you're willing to defend the Sorrows, why not pursue the White Legs?
GID00086540	Joshua's a New Canaanite and he's obviously willing to attack the White Legs.
GID00086541	Joshua's come up with a reasonable alternative. Why not help them fight?
GID00086542	That makes sense. Let's talk about something else.
GID00086543	The use of violence only leads to more violence.
GID00086544	She said one of her births was difficult and you helped her through it.
GID00086545	Did you help the rest of her family leave Zion?
GID00086546	What's the matter? Did something happen?
GID00086547	O... kay, let's talk about something else then.
GID00086548	It's her husband! Don't you think she has a right to know?
GID00086549	I don't think you should hide this from her, but I see your point. I won't say anything.
GID00086550	Settle down. I'm not telling her squat.
GID00086551	You're the New Canaanite who's supposed help lead these people, not hide things from them.
GID00086552	Aren't you the guy in charge around here?
GID00086553	That's too bad, because I'm going to tell her.
GID00086554	Fine. Forget it.
GID00086555	I have an addiction problem.
GID00086556	Oh, the usual. A few scrapes, burns, and bullet wounds.
GID00086557	Radiation sickness.
GID00086558	I need medical supplies.
GID00086559	Yes. Here's 200 caps.
GID00086560	Hmm. I guess I don't have 200 caps.
GID00086561	Here's 150 caps for the trouble.
GID00086562	Sure. Will 300 caps cover it?
GID00086563	I can handle the expenses. 600 caps should cover everything, shouldn't it?
GID00086564	I guess I don't quite have 150 caps...
GID00086565	Actually, I think I'll be fine. Thanks anyway.
GID00086566	It looks like I'm a bit short of 300 caps...
GID00086567	Er... it looks like I don't quite have 600 caps.
GID00086568	Here's 300 caps to cover the expenses.
GID00086569	I don't quite have 300 caps.
GID00086570	You said you "used to" help the Sorrows with problems. What do you do now?
GID00086571	I'm trading Pre-War goods and supplies from the Mojave Wasteland. You need those too, don't you?
GID00086572	But I have... caps. Many of them. Let me show you all of my fine caps.
GID00086573	Most of the Sorrows and Dead Horses are protected. I'm out there getting shot up by White Legs.
GID00086574	Yeah, but I'm helping you so... come on.
GID00086575	I understand.
GID00086576	Salvation? From what, the wasteland?
GID00086577	What does a bishop do? Is that your boss?
GID00086578	Has this happened before, the White Legs attacking other tribes?
GID00086579	The White Legs are here already, so what's your plan?
GID00086580	What happened at New Canaan?
GID00086581	Were you close to Mordecai?
GID00086582	If you don't acknowledge your past now, it'll come back to you later.
GID00086583	That's it?
GID00086584	Interesting.
GID00086585	Sounds kind of far-fetched, even for the wasteland.
GID00086586	Why don't you teach them something useful instead of filling their heads with nonsense?
GID00086587	You're the man in charge. If something's troubling you, it could affect all of us.
GID00086588	I'm just curious, that's all.
GID00086589	I understand. Let's talk about something else.
GID00086590	I'd like to talk to you about Mordecai.
GID00086591	Let's talk about something else.
GID00086592	And you have the right to pull them off of their land?
GID00086593	This is the way the world is. They're part of it, whether you like it or not.
GID00086594	Uh... you might want to have a chat with them. They think your "Lord" and the "Father" are the same.
GID00086595	I had some other questions for you.
GID00086596	Here, take three of my healing powders.
GID00086597	Here, take five of my healing powders.
GID00086598	I don't have any more questions. Let's talk about something else.
GID00086599	Why are you called Follows-Chalk?
GID00086600	I'll do what I can, but I need to defend myself if I'm attacked.
GID00086601	Who is this Joshua?
GID00086602	Civilized lands? What do you mean?
GID00086603	I don't have time for this. Go away.
GID00086604	What are all those tattoos?
GID00086605	Tell me about your tribe.
GID00086606	What did Joshua do for you?
GID00086607	Do you remember anything about Joshua from before he became your leader?
GID00086608	What do you know about the New Canaanites?
GID00086609	What's with the shell casings in your club?
GID00086610	Maybe I can help with that.
GID00086611	All right, I'll look into it.
GID00086612	That sounds like way too much work. Maybe later.
GID00086613	Why is it so important that we fight the White Legs?
GID00086614	Wait, what about Caesar?
GID00086615	All right, let's go.
GID00086616	What happened to him?
GID00086617	The only recent war I know of is when Caesar's Legion attacked Hoover Dam. Is that where he fought?
GID00086618	Small? Have you ever seen Hoover Dam? It's bigger than some of these mountains.
GID00086619	You'd be surprised what "civilized" tribes will fight over.
GID00086620	Are you sure? You've been a useful companion so far.
GID00086621	Give my regards to Joshua, then.
GID00086622	Typical. Just when I get a useful minion....
GID00086623	What is this place?
GID00086624	Who are you?
GID00086625	Hang on, I want to know more about what's going on.
GID00086626	Okay, I'll go talk to him.
GID00086627	I had no reason to stay for that fight.
GID00086628	White Legs? Who are they?
GID00086629	Huh, I think I know that guy. Small world.
GID00086630	Who is this Joshua?
GID00086631	I could use a guide. Let's go.
GID00086632	No way, pal. I'm not traipsing around the desert with a barbarian who doesn't wear pants.
GID00086633	What would you suggest I do instead?
GID00086634	You've got a funny idea about what the Mojave's like, but I'll go with you and see your boss.
GID00086635	Wait, what? New Canaan was wiped out? How?
GID00086636	Where do they come from?
GID00086637	Wildlife problem? What kind of wildlife?
GID00086638	Wildlife problem? What kind of wildlife?
GID00086639	What does Joshua think of this?
GID00086640	Really? Maybe I could talk to him about it for you. Be a neutral party.
GID00086641	He said he has a hard time being objective about the whole idea, and that I should give you advice.
GID00086642	<Lie> That it's a den of corruption and vice, and the Dead Horses' way of living is better.
GID00086643	<Lie> That a man must follow his heart no matter where it leads him.
GID00086644	I know that guy! I got him a job!
GID00086645	What taboo places?
GID00086646	Where should we start looking?
GID00086647	You should stay here with your people. You have a duty to them.
GID00086648	Civilization isn't perfect, but neither is tribal life. You should go see it for yourself.
GID00086649	What's this "place where the little ones fell?"
GID00086650	White Legs? Those are the people who attacked us?
GID00086651	If you're willing, I'll take the help.
GID00086652	Forget it, I'm out of here.
GID00086653	Wait, Joshua! Don't!
GID00086654	Let's do it.
GID00086655	I came here with the Happy Trails Caravan Company to make contact with the New Canaanites.
GID00086656	Joshua, you've already won. Look around you. There's no need to kill him.
GID00086657	Let him keep his dignity. Give him a fighting chance.
GID00086658	No objections.
GID00086659	How do I get out of here?
GID00086660	I'm not going to leave without offering to help. What can I do?
GID00086661	Don't try to get me to help you. I'm not interested.
GID00086662	How about I go find dear Daniel and shake the information out of him?
GID00086663	Why don't you or Daniel do it?
GID00086664	Taboo?
GID00086665	I'll see what I can do.
GID00086666	Sorry, but I'm not going on a scavenger hunt for you.
GID00086667	Fine. What do you need?
GID00086668	I'll see you on the other side.
GID00086669	I'll see you on the other side.
GID00086670	Well, I'm guessing you're pretty mad about something.
GID00086671	All right, let's go.
GID00086672	No, and I don't really care.
GID00086673	You don't want to leave Zion. You'd rather kill every last one of the White Legs.
GID00086674	This conversation just got pretty dark. What was that about happy... dashing the little ones?
GID00086675	Why are you talking to me about it?
GID00086676	You'll get no argument from me. These White Legs are human garbage.
GID00086677	I'll talk to him about it. Maybe he can be persuaded.
GID00086678	I need to think about it.
GID00086679	Yes, what has to be done is you have to get these tribes out of here.
GID00086680	And what kind of tribe is that?
GID00086681	I do. They're little more than raiders, if that.
GID00086682	Fair enough, I guess.
GID00086683	Hmm. Okay.
GID00086684	I don't know if you've figured this out yet, but I don't believe what you believe.
GID00086685	Fair enough. What do you want me to do about it?
GID00086686	Enough with the drama. I just want to get home.
GID00086687	Sounds like a good deal.
GID00086688	Huh. If you say so.
GID00086689	Ha ha ha! Wait... you don't actually believe that, do you?
GID00086690	Do you ever "fall?"
GID00086691	Why did the White Legs attack my caravan?
GID00086692	Does the valley belong to the Dead Horses?
GID00086693	Why haven't I seen any Sorrows in the valley?
GID00086694	Are the New Canaanites really a tribe?
GID00086695	Thanks for the offer, but I'll handle it myself.
GID00086696	What do you know of Salt-Upon-Wounds?
GID00086697	Do they speak... our language?
GID00086698	Let's talk about something else.
GID00086699	Fine, I'll look into getting those supplies for Daniel.
GID00086700	I have a few questions for you.
GID00086701	Were you always with the New Canaanites?
GID00086702	If what you believe is true, he'll pay for it later. The Sorrows don't need to see you do this.
GID00086703	What are those bandages for?
GID00086704	Who are you to decide this?
GID00086705	Was one of those men Caesar?
GID00086706	How did you end up as Caesar's legate?
GID00086707	How did you survive?
GID00086708	Are you in much pain? Is there anything I can do to help?
GID00086709	What do you know about the war between Caesar and NCR?
GID00086710	What do you think of NCR?
GID00086711	You know that means I'm going to encourage him to leave, right?
GID00086712	Do you know about Mr. House?
GID00086713	I'm guessing you don't like Caesar very much.
GID00086714	What's at the Divide?
GID00086715	The Divide blocked all of their northern land routes?
GID00086716	Hmm. Okay.
GID00086717	Fine by me. I prefer the wilderness.
GID00086718	Caesar is dead. I saw to it personally. I thought you should know.
GID00086719	They won't. I'll make sure the Legion has very little to go home with.
GID00086720	We'll see.
GID00086721	You don't think Lanius can lead the Legion?
GID00086722	I have some gear that needs repairs.
GID00086723	How do you know so much about what happened to me?
GID00086724	You're saying that you killed a Brotherhood of Steel Paladin?
GID00086725	Please go on. This promises to be entertaining.
GID00086726	Guns Check
GID00086727	Too bad there's no such thing as an 11mm submachinegun.
GID00086728	What a shot!
GID00086729	That's quite a story.
GID00086730	Survival check re: "Deathjaws"
GID00086731	"Deathjaws," huh? Did you mean to say "Deathclaws?"
GID00086732	"Deathjaws?" I've never heard of those...
GID00086733	What a load of crap. The eyeslits of T-series power armor are bullet-proof!
GID00086734	Black Widow
GID00086735	I'll bring my tweezers and a microscope.
GID00086737	Great, I'll see what I'm shooting at.
GID00086738	Ewww. I think I'll pass.
GID00086739	for extra gear.
GID00086740	Looks like you're traveling light. What would you say to carrying some of my stuff?
GID00086741	Looks like you're traveling light. Carry some items for me, and I'll make it worth your while.
GID00086742	How much Psycho you got stashed away? If you run out on the trail... the withdrawal's not pleasant.
GID00086743	I've got Psycho to sell, but it won't come cheap.
GID00086744	I can sell you a dose of Fixer, but it won't be cheap.
GID00086745	Yeah, leave now. Before the withdrawal hits you out on the trail, no Psycho for miles.
GID00086746	One hit for 30 caps.
GID00086747	Two hits for 60 caps.
GID00086748	Three hits for 90 caps.
GID00086749	Five hits for 150 caps.
GID00086750	Ten hits for 300 caps.
GID00086751	80 caps.
GID00086752	Never mind. It's your problem, not mine.
GID00086753	Never mind. Keep living the dream.
GID00086754	I'll give you 100 caps to make sure Jed lets me carry extra gear.
GID00086755	I'll give you 75 caps to make sure Jed lets me carry extra gear.
GID00086756	I'll give you 50 caps to make sure Jed lets me carry extra gear.
GID00086757	Never mind, I don't want to spend caps on that right now.
GID00086759	I don't think your Pip-Boy works. I'd better go tell Jed.
GID00086760	I guess two Pip-Boys is better than one, anyway.
GID00086762	Your Pip-Boy isn't working. The screen's locked up, and the reboot button is missing.
GID00086763	Any chance you could show me some new ways to use my Pip-Boy?
GID00086764	I'm convincing, you're not. He'll believe me.
GID00086765	What I want is for you to scram. This expedition doesn't need you.
GID00086766	Carry some of my gear, and I'll keep my mouth shut.
GID00086767	Vow of secrecy? Fine, forget about it.
GID00086768	PER check.
GID00086769	You're lying. You have no idea where Vault 22 is.
GID00086770	Sorry - didn't mean to be pushy.
GID00086771	PER check.
GID00086772	You're lying. You've never been to Vault 22.
GID00086773	Sorry - didn't mean to be pushy.
GID00086774	I've got your number, that's all. Just wanted you to know.
GID00086775	Wait! There's no reason this has to end in bloodshed!
GID00086776	Can't we just, you know, be friends?
GID00086777	Time to die, General Gobbledegook!
GID00086778	Your power is broken. You cannot hope to prevail here. Leave this valley in peace.
GID00086779	You're right. We're going to kill you, but not like this. Defend yourself!
GID00086780	I've already crushed your warriors. Retreat now and rebuild your tribe, or die in obscurity.
GID00086781	Daniel and the Sorrows are weak prey, not fit for such mighty warriors.
GID00086782	Then see how strong my spears are, warrior.
GID00086783	Let's end this, then.
GID00086784	Whatever. Joshua, put a cap in General Gobbledigook here.
GID00086785	Whoa. This isn't what I signed up for. Let me talk to Joshua about this.
GID00086786	Wait a minute, what if I don't want to do any of that?
GID00086787	I have the sacred datura here.
GID00086788	Not yet. I had some questions first.
GID00086789	All right, let's do this.
GID00086790	Not yet. I need a moment.
GID00086791	It's done.
GID00086792	Not yet. I had some questions first.
GID00086793	Okay then. I guess I'll just... go then.
GID00086794	What? I don't know what "visions of truth" means.
GID00086795	Crazy old man. I'm not doing anything for you.
GID00086796	(ask questions)
GID00086798	Okay then... I guess... I guess I don't have any questions after all.
GID00086799	I've already got the roots you need.
GID00086800	Umm... tell me about this vision quest again?
GID00086801	Who or what is the Ghost of She?
GID00086802	Umm... Goodbye.
GID00086803	What can I do to help?
GID00086804	Wait, you think the survivalist is... God?
GID00086805	That doesn't sound like what I've heard about the New Canaanites....
GID00086806	I see. That's fascinating.
GID00086807	Holy books?
GID00086808	Have you known him long?
GID00086809	Midwife? I haven't seen any children around.
GID00086810	What do you do when you're not delivering babies?
GID00086811	Safe? Where are they?
GID00086812	I had other questions.
GID00086813	I'm afraid so. Daniel kept it from you because he thought the grief would distract you.
GID00086814	He was only doing what he thought was best for the tribe. It wasn't an easy choice for him.
GID00086815	I agree. It was arrogant and cruel - not exactly the kind of thing a friend would do.
GID00086816	You're right. Now, what are you going to do about it?
GID00086817	Any advice on how to deal with the situation?
GID00086818	So the totems are sacred to them somehow? Good to know.
GID00086819	Okay then, let's get down there and take care of business.
GID00086820	What should we do about it?
GID00086821	These traps must have come from somewhere - I bet the White Legs who placed them are still around.
GID00086822	Let's take care of it then.
GID00086823	What do you propose?
GID00086824	Big deal, I've killed worse.
GID00086825	We'd better get to work then.
GID00086826	I'll be sure to tell Daniel to bring some bear-monster-thing snacks, then.
GID00086827	How would we do that?
GID00086829	What are you talking about?
GID00086830	I don't have time for your religious superstitions. It's just a cave, that's all.
GID00086831	Holy wrath. Right. I'll keep an eye out for that. Bet it looks a lot like a bear trap.
GID00086832	The Father in the Caves was just a man who lived a long time ago.
GID00086833	I understand. I'll respect your beliefs, then, but we need to search the cave.
GID00086834	Sounds good. Let's go.
GID00086835	I prefer to travel alone, thanks.
GID00086836	Let's talk about something else.
GID00086837	Any idea what he wants?
GID00086838	Any idea what he wants?
GID00086839	Okay, I'll talk to him.
GID00086840	Okay, I'll talk to him.
GID00086841	Maybe later, if there's time.
GID00086842	Maybe later, if there's time.
GID00086843	I could talk to him, maybe he'll open up more to me.
GID00086855	No, I've changed my mind.
GID00086856	Yes, I'm sure.
GID00086857	I want you to travel with me.
GID00086858	Let's go.
GID00086860	I want you to change your combat style.
GID00086861	I want you to attack enemies the moment you see them.
GID00086862	That's it for your tactics. Let's talk about something else.
GID00086863	That's all. Let's get going.
GID00086864	Switch to a melee weapon.
GID00086865	I don't want you to attack enemies unless I've already engaged them.
GID00086866	I want you to use ranged weapons.
GID00086867	Let's talk about how close you're following me.
GID00086868	Stay close to me.
GID00086869	Your distance is good. Let's talk about something else.
GID00086870	You're good. Let's get going.
GID00086871	Spread out and keep your distance from me.
GID00086872	Enough about tactics. Let's talk about something else.
GID00086873	That's all. Let's get going.
GID00086874	Wait here.
GID00086932	Umm... what?
GID00086933	Am I... looking for Joshua? Yes, I am. Can you tell me where he is?
GID00086934	If you're too dumb to speak my language, you're too dumb to talk to me. Get lost.
GID00086935	Yes, I'm looking for him. Is he here?
GID00086936	I'll make sure to be on my best behavior, then.
GID00086937	Umm... okay. Thanks for that. I sure would hate to be shown thunder and fire.
GID00086938	Back off, savage - I'm just here for a map out of this shithole valley, not kowtow to your messiah.
GID00086939	I'm sorry, I don't understand you.
GID00086940	No, I smash White Legs alone. You stay here so you not get dead.
GID00086941	Just get out of here, you're no match for hardened White Leg warriors.
GID00086942	Fine, but at least let me handle it alone. You're no match for hardened White Leg warriors.
GID00086943	Sure, whatever. We go smash White Legs.
GID00086944	Just wait here a few minutes. Don't do anything crazy.
GID00086992	I want you to attack enemies the moment you see them.
GID00086993	I want you not to attack enemies unless I've already engaged them.
GID00086994	On second thought, stick with me for a little longer.
GID00086995	Yes, I'm sure.
GID00087000	I think we should travel together.
GID00087001	I want you to travel with me.
GID00087002	I want you to travel with me.
GID00087003	Let's talk about your tactics.
GID00087004	I want you to change your combat style.
GID00087005	Let's talk about something else.
GID00087006	That's it for your tactics. Let's talk about something else.
GID00087007	That's it for your tactics. Let's talk about something else.
GID00087008	That's it for your tactics. Let's talk about something else.
GID00087009	That's all. Let's get going.
GID00087010	Switch to a melee weapon.
GID00087011	I want you to use ranged weapons.
GID00087012	Let's talk about how close you're following me.
GID00087013	Stick close to me.
GID00087014	Stay close to me.
GID00087015	Your distance is good. Let's talk about something else.
GID00087016	All right, you're good. Let's get out of here.
GID00087017	Keep your distance. Try to flank them.
GID00087018	Enough about tactics.
GID00087050	I need some medical assistance. Can you help?
GID00087051	Go back to your people's camp.
GID00087052	Pray? God? What are you talking about?
GID00087053	I want to trade equipment.
GID00087054	Nice guns.
GID00087055	Let's talk about your tactics.
GID00087056	Do you run the show around here?
GID00087057	What's going on with all of these... tribes?
GID00087058	Let's trade equipment.
GID00087059	Do you have anything to trade?
GID00087060	Goodbye.
GID00087061	Goodbye.
GID00087062	I have some gear that needs repairs.
GID00087063	It's time for us to part ways.
GID00087064	Go back to your people's camp.
GID00087065	Go back to your people's camp.
GID00087066	Can I ask you some personal questions?
GID00087067	That's all for now, but I'll be back.
GID00087068	Let's talk more later.
GID00087069	Nothing else. Talk to you later.
GID00087070	Goodbye.
GID00087071	That's all I wanted to know for now.
